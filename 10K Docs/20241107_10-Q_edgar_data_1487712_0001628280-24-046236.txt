 NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other publicly available documents may contain or incorporate statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements appear in a number of places in this Form 10-Q and include statements regarding, among other matters, the state of the airline industry, our access to the capital and debt markets, the impact of Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia, the impact of the Israel Hamas conflict, aircraft and engine delivery delays and manufacturing flaws, including as a result of the Boeing labor strike, our aircraft sales pipeline and expectations, changes in inflation and interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions and other factors affecting our financial condition or results of operations. Words such as can, could, may, predicts, potential, will, projects, continuing, ongoing, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates and should, and variations of these words and similar expressions, are used in many cases to identify these forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results to vary materially from our future results, performance or achievements, or those of our industry, expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others: 
 
 our inability to obtain additional capital on favorable terms, or at all, to acquire aircraft, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations; 
 increases in our cost of borrowing, decreases in our credit ratings or changes in interest rates; 
 our inability to generate sufficient returns on our aircraft investments through strategic aircraft acquisitions and profitable leasing; 
 the failure of an aircraft or engine manufacturer to meet its contractual obligations to us, including or as a result of labor strikes, aviation supply chain constraints, manufacturing flaws, or technical or other difficulties with aircraft or engines before or after delivery; 
 our ability to recover losses related to aircraft detained in Russia, including through insurance claims and related litigation; 
 obsolescence of, or changes in overall demand for, our aircraft; 
 changes in the value of, and lease rates for, our aircraft, including as a result of aircraft oversupply, manufacturer production levels, our lessees failure to maintain our aircraft, inflation, and other factors outside of our control; 
 impaired financial condition and liquidity of our lessees, including due to lessee defaults and reorganizations, bankruptcies or similar proceedings; 
 increased competition from other aircraft lessors; 
 the failure by our lessees to adequately insure our aircraft or fulfill their contractual indemnity obligations to us, or the failure of such insurers to fulfill their contractual obligations; 
 increased tariffs and other restrictions on trade; 
 changes in the regulatory environment, including changes in tax laws and environmental regulations; 
 other events affecting our business or the business of our lessees and aircraft manufacturers or their suppliers that are beyond our or their control, such as the threat or realization of epidemic diseases, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war or armed hostilities between countries or non-state actors; and 
 any additional factors discussed under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings, including future SEC filings. 
 
 All forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future results, and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from expectations. You are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not intend and undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information to reflect actual results or events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

 (1) The Company s Airbus A320/321neo aircraft orders include long-range variants and extra long-range variants. 
 (2) The table above reflects aircraft deliveries based on contractual documentation and production adjustments as communicated by Airbus and Boeing through November 7, 2024. The Company s contractual delivery commitment schedule is subject to a number of factors outside its control, including ongoing delays by Airbus and Boeing for certain aircraft, including as a result of the Boeing labor strike, and the Company cannot guarantee delivery of any particular aircraft at any specific time notwithstanding its contractual delivery commitment schedule. 

The table above is subject to change based on Airbus and Boeing delivery delays. As noted below, the Company expects delivery delays for some aircraft in its orderbook. The Company remains in discussions with Airbus and Boeing to determine the extent and duration of delivery delays; however, the Company is not currently able to determine the full impact of these delays. 
 
 Pursuant to the Company s purchase agreements with Airbus and Boeing, the Company agrees to contractual delivery dates for each aircraft ordered. These dates can change for a variety of reasons, however for the last several years, manufacturing delays have significantly impacted the planned purchases of the Company s aircraft on order with Airbus and Boeing. The Company is currently experiencing delivery delays with both Airbus and Boeing aircraft. 
 
 In January 2024, the FAA ordered the temporary grounding of certain Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft after the in-flight loss of a mid-cabin exit door plug in one aircraft. The 737-9 MAX aircraft has since returned to service; however, Boeing will not be allowed

 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 Compensation cost for RSUs is measured at the grant date based on fair value and recognized over the vesting period. The fair value of time based and book value RSUs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant, while the fair value of RSUs that vest based on the attainment of TSR goals is determined at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Included in the Monte Carlo simulation model were certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. To appropriately value the award, the risk-free interest rate is estimated for the time period from the valuation date until the vesting date and the historical volatilities were estimated based on a historical timeframe equal to the time from the valuation date until the end date of the performance period.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
 
 Air Lease Corporation (the Company , ALC , we , our or us is a leading aircraft leasing company that was founded by aircraft leasing industry pioneer, Steven F. Udvar-H zy. We are principally engaged in purchasing the most modern, fuel-efficient new technology commercial jet aircraft directly from aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus S.A.S. Airbus and The Boeing Company Boeing ), and leasing those aircraft to airlines throughout the world with the intention to generate attractive returns on equity. In addition to our leasing activities, we sell aircraft from our fleet to third-parties, including other leasing companies, financial services companies, airlines and other investors. We also provide fleet management services to investors and owners of aircraft portfolios for a management fee. Our operating performance is driven by the growth of our fleet, the terms of our leases, the interest rates on our debt, and the aggregate amount of our indebtedness, supplemented by gains from aircraft sales and our management fees. 
 
 Third Quarter Overview 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 20 new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing and sold nine aircraft. We ended the third quarter with a total of 485 aircraft in our owned fleet. The net book value of our fleet 1 grew by 6.3 to 27.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 26.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average age of our fleet was 4.6 years and the weighted average lease term remaining was 7.1 years as of September 30, 2024. Our managed fleet was comprised of 64 aircraft as of September 30, 2024 compared to 78 aircraft as of December 31, 2023. We have a globally diversified customer base comprised of 117 airlines in 59 countries as of September 30, 2024. We continued to maintain a strong lease utilization rate of 100.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had commitments to purchase 287 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing for delivery through 2029, with an estimated aggregate commitment of 18.2 billion. We have placed 100 and 95 of our committed orderbook on long-term leases for aircraft delivering through the end of 2025 and 2026, respectively, and have placed 63 of our entire orderbook. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 29.7 billion in committed minimum future rental payments, consisting of 17.6 billion in contracted minimum rental payments on the aircraft in our existing fleet and 12.1 billion in minimum future rental payments related to aircraft which will deliver during the last three months of 2024 through 2028. 
 
 We finance the purchase of aircraft and our business with our available cash balances and internally generated funds, which includes cash flows from our leases, as well as aircraft sales and debt financing activities. Our debt financing strategy is focused on raising unsecured debt in the global bank and debt capital markets, with limited utilization of government guaranteed export credit or other forms of secured financing. During the third quarter of 2024, we entered into a variety of committed term loans totaling approximately 1.0 billion. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with an aggregate borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility of approximately 6.5 billion and total liquidity of 7.5 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we had total debt outstanding of 20.3 billion, of which 81.0 was at a fixed rate and 97.3 was unsecured, and in the aggregate, our composite cost of funds was 4.21 . 
 
 Our total revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4.7 to 690.2 million, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Our total revenues increased from the prior year due to the growth of our fleet and an increase in our sales activity, partially offset by a slight decrease in our lease yields due to the sales of older aircraft with higher lease yields and the purchases of new aircraft with lower initial lease yields. We recorded 41.5 million in gains from the sale of nine aircraft for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39.0 million in gains from the sale of eight aircraft for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We also experienced a decline in end of lease revenue of approximately 12.4 million as compared to the prior period due to fewer aircraft returns during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income attributable to common stockholders of 91.6 million, or 0.82 per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of 122.0 million, or 1.10 per

 diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior year period is primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by the increase in our composite cost of funds and overall outstanding debt balance, partially offset by the increase in our total revenues as discussed above. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded adjusted net income before income taxes 2 of 140.2 million, or 1.25 per adjusted diluted share, compared to an adjusted net income before income taxes of 177.0 million, or 1.59 per adjusted diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted net income before income taxes decreased primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by the increase in our composite cost of funds and overall outstanding debt balance, partially offset by an increase in our total revenues as discussed above. 

Our Fleet 
 
 We continue to own one of the youngest fleets among aircraft lessors, including some of the most fuel-efficient commercial jet aircraft available. Our fleet, based on net book value, increased by 6.3 , to 27.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 26.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 20 new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing and sold nine aircraft. We ended the period with a total of 485 aircraft in our owned fleet. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average fleet age and weighted average remaining lease term of our fleet were 4.6 years and 7.1 years, respectively. We also managed 64 aircraft as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our portfolio metrics as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:

 The tables above are subject to change based on Airbus and Boeing delivery delays. As noted above, we expect delivery delays for certain aircraft in our orderbook, including as a result of the Boeing labor strike. We remain in discussions with Airbus and Boeing to determine the extent and duration of delivery delays; however, we are not currently able to determine the full impact of these delays. 
 
 Aircraft Delivery Delays 
 
 Pursuant to our purchase agreements with Airbus and Boeing, we agree to contractual delivery dates for each aircraft ordered. These dates can change for a variety of reasons, however for the last several years, manufacturing delays have significantly impacted the planned purchases of our aircraft on order with both Airbus and Boeing. 
 
 In January 2024, the FAA ordered the temporary grounding of certain Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft after the in-flight loss of a mid-cabin exit door plug in one aircraft. The 737-9 MAX aircraft has since returned to service; however, Boeing will not be allowed by the FAA to increase 737 MAX production rates until quality control issues are resolved. In addition, in September 2024, we were notified by Boeing that certain union factory workers had commenced a labor strike. On November 4, 2024, the union factory workers voted to end the labor strike. We did not take delivery of any 737 MAX aircraft during the labor strike and some 787 deliveries were impacted. We expect our Boeing deliveries will continue to be delayed and are unable to estimate the duration of delays or the impact on our Boeing orderbook. The residual impacts of the Boeing labor strike have and may continue to impact the broader aviation supply chain. 
 
 Our purchase agreements with Airbus and Boeing generally provide each of us and the manufacturers with cancellation rights for delivery delays starting at one year after the original contractual delivery date, regardless of cause. In addition, our lease agreements generally provide each of us and the lessees with cancellation rights related to certain aircraft delivery delays that typically parallel the cancellation rights in our purchase agreements. 
 
 As a result of continued manufacturing delays and supply chain constraints described herein, our aircraft delivery schedule could continue to be subject to material changes and delivery delays are expected to extend for at least the next three to four years.

Table of Contents 

 The following table, which is subject to change based on Airbus and Boeing delivery delays, shows the number of new aircraft contractually scheduled to be delivered as of September 30, 2024, along with the lease placements of such aircraft as of November 7, 2024. Airbus and Boeing have expressed their desire to increase production rates on several aircraft types but have not meaningfully increased production because of several factors, including ongoing supply chain constraints and other production issues. At current production rates, we do not see delivery delays significantly improving in the near term for Airbus aircraft because of the ongoing impact from Pratt Whitney GTF engine manufacturing flaws impacting the Airbus A320neo family aircraft production rates. Our Airbus deliveries may also be impacted by the impact of the Boeing labor strike on the broader aviation supply chain. We expect that the residual effects of the Boeing labor strike will continue to significantly impact our Boeing deliveries, including as a result of the halt in 737 MAX production and deliveries and some 787 deliveries during the labor strike. We remain in discussions with Airbus and Boeing to determine the extent and duration of delivery delays, but we are not currently able to determine the full impact of these delays.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had commitments to purchase 287 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing for delivery through 2029, with an estimated aggregate commitment of 18.2 billion. We have placed 95 of our committed orderbook on long-term leases for aircraft delivering through the end of 2026; however, due to the delivery delays from the aircraft manufacturers as discussed above, we expect to deliver 130 aircraft through 2026, of which 100 are placed. 
 
 Aircraft Industry and Sources of Revenues 
 
 Our revenues are principally derived from operating leases with airlines throughout the world. As of September 30, 2024, we had a globally diversified customer base of 117 airlines in 59 different countries, with over 95 of our business revenues from airlines domiciled outside of the U.S., and we anticipate that most of our revenues in the future will be generated from foreign customers. 
 
 We believe the current airline operating environment is favorably positioned for us and the broader commercial aircraft leasing industry. Factors such as increases in population growth and the size of the global middle class as well as air travel demand, and improved global economic health and development positively affect the long-term performance of the commercial aircraft leasing industry. In addition, factors and trends including increased airline financing needs, OEM supply chain challenges and backlogs, the rising price of jet fuel, and environmental sustainability objectives impact the commercial aircraft leasing industry in the short-term and may increase the demand for our aircraft. 
 
 Passenger traffic volume has historically expanded at a faster rate than global GDP growth, in part due to the expansion of the global middle class and the ease and affordability of air travel, which we expect to continue. The International Air Transport Association IATA reported that passenger traffic was up 7 in September 2024 relative to the prior year period, primarily due to continued strength in international traffic and healthy continued expansion of domestic traffic globally. International traffic in September rose 9 relative to the prior year, benefiting from robust continued international travel expansion in the Asia Pacific region, as well as strong international expansion in most other major markets reported by IATA. Global domestic traffic rose 4 in September as compared to the prior year period, remaining above the pace of global GDP expansion. Total passenger traffic volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 rose 11 as compared to the same period in 2023. Meanwhile, passenger load factors also are persisting at historically high levels, which is compounding airline demand for additional aircraft. IATA reported total global passenger load factors of 84 for September 2024, as compared to 83 in the prior year period and 79 for full-year 2022. 
 
 As global air traffic continues to expand, we are experiencing increased demand for our aircraft through new lease requests and lease extension requests, which we expect to continue into 2025. Airline forward ticket sales as reported by IATA remained healthy in

 the third quarter 2024, illustrating continued support for traffic volume expansion. We expect the need for airlines to replace aging aircraft will also increase the demand for newer, more fuel efficient aircraft. As a result, we believe many airlines will look to lessors for these new aircraft. In addition, both Airbus and Boeing have ongoing delivery delays which have been further compounded by engine manufacturer delays, shorter on wing engine time of most new technology engines and, most recently, the Boeing labor strike announced in September 2024. On November 4, 2024, the union factory workers voted to end the labor strike. The labor strike has impacted Boeing s ability to produce and deliver aircraft in our orderbook and we anticipate ongoing impacts to our Boeing orderbook deliveries. We expect deliveries of our 737MAX aircraft and some 787 deliveries will continue to be impacted by the residual effects of the labor strike. In addition, the Boeing labor strike could lead to negative impacts on the broader aviation supply chain which could ultimately impact other OEMs, including Airbus. We also expect that relatively low levels of widebody retirements in recent years could lead to an accelerated replacement cycle of older widebody aircraft in the near future. 
 
 The increased demand for our new aircraft, combined with elevated interest rates and inflation, helped to increase lease rates on new lease agreements and lease extensions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, lease rate increases continue to lag behind our rising borrowing costs. We expect that lease rates will remain strong as the supply and demand environment for commercial aircraft remains tight and our funding advantage relative to our airline customers widens. Lease rates are influenced by several factors above and beyond interest rates, including aircraft demand, supply technicals, supply chain disruptions, environmental initiatives and other factors that may result in a change in lease rates regardless of the interest rate environment and therefore, are difficult to project or forecast. We also believe the increase in lease rates and the sustained tightness in the credit markets may result in a shortfall of available capital to finance aircraft purchases, which could increase the demand for leasing. 
 
 As of November 7,2024, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee FOMC has lowered the target range for the Federal Funds Rate to 4.50 to 4.75 . In general, reductions in the Federal Funds Rate should reduce the interest rate on our existing borrowings that bear interest at a floating rate, including our Revolving Credit Facility. Reductions in the Federal Funds Rate also tend to lower the interest rates available to us for new debt borrowings. However, we cannot predict whether the FOMC will continue to reduce the target range for the Federal Funds Rate or the impact of any such reductions on our interest expense or future debt borrowings. 
 
 Airline reorganizations, liquidations, or other forms of bankruptcies occurring in the industry may include some of our aircraft customers and result in the early return of aircraft or changes in our lease terms. Our airline customers are facing higher operating costs as a result of higher fuel costs, increased interest rates, inflation, foreign currency risk, ongoing labor shortages and disputes, as well as delays and cancellations caused by the global air traffic control system and airports, although the magnitude of underlying pre-pandemic demand returning to the market is offering a strong counterbalance to these increased costs. 
 
 We believe the aircraft leasing industry has remained resilient over time across a variety of global economic conditions and remain optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of our business. We believe leasing will continue to be an attractive form of aircraft financing for airlines because less cash and financing is required for the airlines, lessors maintain key delivery positions, and it provides fleet flexibility while eliminating residual value risk for lessees. 
 
 Update on Russian Fleet 
 
 As previously disclosed in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in June 2022, we and certain of our subsidiaries submitted insurance claims to the insurers on our aviation insurance policies to recover losses relating to aircraft detained in Russia for which we recorded a net write-off of our interests in our owned and managed aircraft totaling approximately 771.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. In December 2022, we filed suit in the Los Angeles County Superior Court of the State of California against our aviation insurance carriers in connection with our previously submitted insurance claims for which a trial date has been set for April 17, 2025. We continue to have significant claims against our aviation insurance carriers and will continue to vigorously pursue all available insurance claims and our related insurance litigation, and all rights and remedies therein. Collection, timing and amounts of any future insurance and related recoveries and the outcome of our ongoing insurance litigation remain uncertain at this time. See Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings for more information on our ongoing litigation proceedings regarding aircraft that remain detained in Russia. 
 
 As of November 7, 2024, we maintain title to 16 aircraft previously included in our owned fleet and the respective managed platform maintains title to two aircraft previously included in our managed fleet that are still detained in Russia. While we remain in ongoing settlement discussions regarding these aircraft, the operators of these aircraft have continued to fly most of the aircraft notwithstanding the termination of leasing activities. It is uncertain whether any of these discussions will result in any settlement or receipt of settlement proceeds and, if so, in what amount.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with available liquidity of 7.5 billion, which was comprised of unrestricted cash of 460.8 million, unfunded commitments from a term loan of 500.0 million and undrawn balances under our unsecured revolving credit facility of approximately 6.5 billion. We finance the purchase of aircraft and our business operations using our available cash balances and internally generated funds, which includes cash flows from our leases, as well as aircraft sales and debt financing activities. We aim to maintain investment-grade credit metrics and focus our debt financing strategy on funding our business primarily on an unsecured basis with mostly fixed-rate debt issued in the public bond market. Unsecured financing provides us with operational flexibility when selling or transitioning aircraft from one airline to another. We also have the ability to seek debt financing secured by our assets, as well as financings supported through government-guaranteed export credit agencies for future aircraft deliveries. We have also issued preferred stock in recent years and have outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate stated amount of 900.0 million as of November 7, 2024. Our access to a variety of financing alternatives and the global capital markets, including capital raises through unsecured public notes denominated in U.S. dollars or various foreign currencies, private capital, bank debt, secured debt and preferred stock issuances serves as a key advantage in managing our liquidity. Ongoing aircraft delivery delays due to manufacturer delays and the Boeing labor strike are expected to further reduce our aircraft investment and debt financing needs for the next 12 months and potentially beyond. 
 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with total debt outstanding of 20.3 billion, of which 81.0 was at a fixed rate and 97.3 was unsecured, and in the aggregate, our composite cost of funds was 4.21 . As of December 31, 2023, we had total debt outstanding of 19.4 billion, of which 84.7 was at a fixed rate and 98.4 of which was unsecured, and in the aggregate, our composite cost of funds was 3.77 . 
 
 Capital Allocation Strategy 
 
 We have a balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of priority: first, investing in modern, in-demand aircraft to profitably grow our core aircraft leasing business while maintaining strong fleet metrics and creating sustainable long-term shareholder value; second, maintaining our investment grade balance sheet utilizing unsecured debt as our primary form of financing; and finally, in line with the aforementioned priorities, returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend policy as well as regular evaluation of share repurchases, as appropriate. 
 
 Material Cash Sources and Requirements 
 
 We believe that we have sufficient liquidity from available cash balances, cash generated from ongoing operations, available commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility and general ability to access the capital and debt markets for opportunistic debt financings to satisfy the operating requirements of our business through at least the next 12 months. Our long-term debt financing strategy is focused on continuing to raise primarily unsecured debt in the global bank and investment grade capital markets. Our material cash sources include: 
 
 Unrestricted cash: We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 0.5 billion in unrestricted cash. 
 Lease cash flows: We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 29.7 billion in committed minimum future rental payments comprised of 17.6 billion in contracted minimum rental payments on the aircraft in our existing fleet and 12.1 billion in minimum future rental payments related to aircraft which will deliver during the last three months of 2024 through 2028. These rental payments are a primary driver of our short and long-term operating cash flow. As of September 30, 2024, our minimum future rentals on our existing non-cancellable operating leases for the next 12 months was 2.5 billion. For further detail on our minimum future rentals for the remainder of 2024 and thereafter, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Unsecured revolving credit facility : As of November 7, 2024, our 7.8 billion revolving credit facility is syndicated across 52 financial institutions from various regions of the world, diversifying our reliance on any individual lending institution. The final maturity for the facility is May 2028, although we expect to refinance this facility in advance of that date. The facility contains standard investment grade covenants and does not condition our ability to borrow on the lack of a material adverse effect on us or the general economy. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.3 billion outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.

 Senior unsecured securities: We are a frequent issuer in the investment grade capital markets, opportunistically issuing unsecured notes, primarily through our Medium-Term Note Program at attractive cost of funds and other senior unsecured securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued approximately 2.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes (inclusive of any associated hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency denominated issuances) with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2031 and with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3 . We expect to have continued access to the investment grade bond market and other unsecured securities in the future, although we continue to anticipate that interest rates for issuances in the near term will remain elevated compared to those available prior to 2022. 
 Unsecured bank facilities: We have active dialogue with a variety of global financial institutions and enter into new unsecured credit facilities from time to time as a means to supplement our liquidity and sources of funding. These loans are typically pre-payable without penalty at any time offering us significant flexibility in different rate environments. 
 Aircraft sales: Proceeds from the sale of aircraft help supplement our liquidity position. We have 1.5 billion of aircraft in our sales pipeline 3 , which includes 741.1 million of aircraft classified as flight equipment held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and 745.0 million of aircraft subject to letters of intent 4 . We expect the sale of the majority of our aircraft classified as flight equipment held for sale to be completed by the second half of 2025. We continue to expect to sell approximately 1.5 billion in aircraft for 2024 and continue to see robust demand in the secondary market to support our aircraft sales program. 
 Other sources: In addition to the above, we generate liquidity through cash received from security deposits and maintenance reserves from our lease agreements, other sources of debt financings (including secured bank term loans, export credit and private placements), as well as issuances of preferred stock. 
 
 Tighter monetary policies in the United States and other countries since early 2022 resulted in rapid interest rate increases over a relatively short period of time and many are predicting that rates may remain elevated despite the recent rate cut by the FOMC. This higher interest rate environment has resulted in increased borrowing costs for us and will result in increased borrowing costs until interest rates decline. Historically, there has been a lag between a rise in interest rates and subsequent increases in lease rates. While we have experienced increasing lease rates on new lease agreements and lease extensions since 2023, which are serving to partially offset increased borrowing costs, lease rate increases continue to lag the rapid increase in interest rates. We believe that lease rates should continue to increase as airlines adjust to a persistently higher rate environment and our funding advantage relative to our airline customers widens. In addition, lease rates are influenced by several factors above and beyond interest rates, including supply technicals driven by aircraft demand, supply chain disruptions, environmental initiatives and other factors that may result in a change in lease rates regardless of the interest rate environment. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants contained in our debt agreements. While a ratings downgrade would not result in a default under any of our debt agreements, it could adversely affect our ability to issue debt and obtain new financings, or renew existing financings, and it would increase the interest rate applicable to certain of our financings. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our material cash requirements are primarily comprised of aircraft purchases, debt service payments and general operating expenses. The amount of our cash requirements depends on a variety of factors, including, the ability of aircraft manufacturers to meet their contractual delivery obligations to us, the ability of our lessees to meet their contractual obligations with us, the timing of aircraft sales from our fleet, the timing and amount of our debt service obligations, potential aircraft acquisitions, and the general economic environment in which we operate. 

3 Aircraft in our sales pipeline is as of September 30, 2024, adjusted for letters of intent signed through November 7, 2024. 
 4 While our management s historical experience is that non-binding letters of intent for aircraft sales generally lead to binding contracts, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately execute binding sales agreements for all or any of the aircraft subject to letters of intent or predict the timing of closing for any such aircraft sales.

 (2) Future interest payments on floating rate debt are estimated using floating rates in effect at September 30, 2024, which is inclusive of any cross-currency hedging arrangements. 

The actual delivery dates of the aircraft in our commitments table and the expected time for payment of such aircraft may differ from our estimates and could be further impacted by the pace at which Airbus and Boeing can deliver aircraft, among other factors. As a result, the timing of our contractual purchase commitments shown in the table above may not reflect when the aircraft investments are actually made. For 2024, we currently expect to make approximately 4.6 billion in aircraft investments. 
 
 The above table does not include any tax payments we may pay nor any dividends we may pay on our preferred stock or common stock. 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Our cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by 2.7 or 35.3 million, to 1.25 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.28 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our cash flow provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to an increase in our composite cost of funds as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by higher customer cash collections. Our cash flows used in investing activities was 2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the increase in our aircraft investments partially offset by the decrease in proceeds from our aircraft sales and trading activity. Our investing activities are primarily driven by the timing of our aircraft purchases and our sales and trading activity. Our cash flow provided by financing activities was 1.43 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 122.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt borrowings, partially offset by an increase in debt repayments. Our financing activities are mainly driven by changes in our investing activities.

Senior unsecured securities (including Medium-Term Note Program) 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 16.4 billion and 16.3 billion in senior unsecured securities outstanding, respectively. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued (i) 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.10 Medium-Term Notes due 2029, (ii) Canadian dollar C denominated debt of C 400.0 million in additional aggregate principal amount of 5.40 Medium-Term Notes due 2028 2024 C notes ), (iii) Euro denominated debt of 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.70 Medium-Term Notes due 2030 2024 notes ), (iv) 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.30 Medium-Term Notes due 2026 and (v) 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.20 Medium-Term Notes due 2031. 
 
 The C notes issued in 2024 have the same terms as, and constitute a single tranche with, the C 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40 Medium-Term Notes issued in November 2023. We hedged the 2024 C notes through a cross-currency swap that converts the borrowing rate to a fixed 5.95 U.S. dollar denominated rate. We hedged the 2024 notes through a cross-currency swap that converts the borrowing rate to a fixed 5.441 U.S. dollar denominated rate. The swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the derivative recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss). See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 for additional details on the fair value of the swaps. 
 
 Unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1.3 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, outstanding under our unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are used to finance our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business and for other general corporate purposes. 
 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 In April 2024, we amended and extended our Revolving Credit Facility through an amendment that, among other things, extended the final maturity date from May 5, 2027 to May 5, 2028 and amended the total revolving commitments thereunder to approximately 7.8 billion as of May 5, 2024. As of November 7, 2024, lenders held revolving commitments totaling approximately 7.5 billion that mature on May 5, 2028, commitments totaling 25.0 million that mature on May 5, 2027, 210.0 million that mature on May 5, 2026 and commitments totaling 25.0 million that mature on May 5, 2025. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility continue to accrue interest at Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 1.05 per year. We are required to pay a facility fee of 0.20 per year in respect of total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest rate and facility fees are subject to changes in our credit ratings. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility provides for certain covenants, including covenants that limit our subsidiaries ability to incur, create, or assume certain unsecured indebtedness, and our subsidiaries abilities to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, and asset sales. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants including minimum consolidated shareholders equity, minimum consolidated unencumbered assets, and an interest coverage test. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default. In the case of an event of default, the lenders may terminate the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and require immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings. 
 
 Unsecured term financings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on our unsecured term financings was 2.1 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively. 
 
 In August 2024, we amended our existing 750.0 million term loan that, among other things, increased the aggregate term loan commitments by an additional 500.0 million and reduced the interest rate applicable to borrowings. Under the terms of the loan agreement, we had the ability to set the funding date of the additional commitments, subject to an outside funding date of November 15, 2024. We elected to borrow the additional 500.0 million on October 1, 2024. As amended, the term loan bears interest at a floating rate of Term SOFR plus 1.20 plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 and has a final maturity on November 24, 2026. The term loan contains customary covenants and events of default consistent with our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024, we had 750.0 million and 1.25 billion in borrowings outstanding under the term loan, respectively. 
 
 In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a 250.0 million unsecured term financing with a one-year maturity bearing interest at a floating rate of Term SOFR plus 1.25 plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 . 
 
 Secured debt financings 
 
 In August 2024, we entered into a 267.3 million secured term loan and pledged six aircraft as collateral with a net book value of 346.6 million. The term loan bears interest at a floating rate of Term SOFR plus 1.35 and has a final maturity on July 31, 2031. The term loan contains customary covenants and events of default consistent with the our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of 551.7 million in secured debt financings, including the secured term loan mentioned above, and had pledged ten aircraft as collateral, with a net book value of 778.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of 305.5 million in secured debt financings and pledged four aircraft as collateral with a net book value of 445.9 million. All of our secured obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are recourse in nature. 
 
 Preferred equity 
 
 In September 2024, we issued 300,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the Series D Preferred Stock ). We will pay dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock only when, as and if declared by the board of directors. Dividends will accrue, on a non-cumulative basis, on the stated amount of 1,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to: (i) 6.00 through December 15, 2029, and payable quarterly in arrears beginning on December 15, 2024, and (ii) the Five-year U.S. Treasury Rate as of the applicable reset dividend determination date plus a spread of 2.560 per reset period from December 15, 2029 and reset every five years and payable quarterly in arrears; provided, that the dividend rate per annum during any reset period will not reset below 6.00 (which equals the initial dividend rate per annum on the Series D Preferred Stock). 
 
 On October 17, 2024, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of 25.00 per share, plus 0.187219 per share in declared and unpaid dividends to but excluding the redemption date. The redemption price paid in excess of the carrying value of Series A Preferred Stock of 7.9 million will be included as a deemed dividend on redemption of

 Off balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have not established any unconsolidated entities for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We have, however, from time to time established subsidiaries or trusts for the purpose of leasing aircraft or facilitating borrowing arrangements which are included in our balance sheet. 
 
 We have non-controlling interests in two investment funds in which we own 9.5 of the equity of each fund. We account for our interest in these funds under the equity method of accounting due to our level of influence and involvement in the funds. Also, we manage certain aircraft that we have sold through our Thunderbolt platform. In connection with the sale of certain aircraft portfolios

Table of Contents 

 through our Thunderbolt platform, we hold non-controlling interests of approximately 5.0 in two entities. These investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. 
 
 For more information regarding our aircraft under management, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 
 In 2024, Kroll Bond Ratings and Standard and Poor s reaffirmed our corporate rating, long-term debt credit rating and outlook. Our investment-grade corporate and long-term debt credit ratings help us to lower our cost of funds and broaden our access to attractively priced capital. The following table summarizes our current credit ratings: 
 
 Rating Agency Long-term Debt Corporate Rating Outlook Date of Last Ratings Action Kroll Bond Ratings 
 A- A- Stable March 22, 2024 Standard and Poor s 
 BBB BBB Stable November 1, 2024 Fitch Ratings 
 BBB BBB Stable December 19, 2023 
 
 While a ratings downgrade would not result in a default under any of our debt agreements, it could adversely affect our ability to issue debt and obtain new financings, or renew existing financings, and it would increase the interest rate applicable to certain of our financings.

 Adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes and adjusted pre-tax return on common equity are presented as supplemental disclosure because management believes they provide useful information on our earnings from ongoing operations. 
 
 Management and our board of directors use adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes and adjusted pre-tax return on common equity to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance. Management believes these measures are helpful in evaluating the operating performance of our ongoing operations and identifying trends in our performance, because they remove the effects of certain non-cash items, one-time or non-recurring items that are not expected to continue in the future and certain other items from our operating results. Adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes and adjusted pre-tax return on common equity, however, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results or cash flows as reported under GAAP. Adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes and adjusted pre-tax return on common equity do not reflect our cash expenditures or changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs. In addition, our calculation of adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes and adjusted pre-tax return on common equity may differ from the adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes and adjusted pre-tax return on common equity, or analogous calculations of other companies in our industry, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Rental revenue 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 625.2 million in rental revenue, which included amortization expense related to initial direct costs, net of overhaul revenue of 7.8 million as compared to 604.0 million, which included overhaul revenue, net of amortization expense related to initial direct costs of 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net book value of our flight equipment subject to operating lease increased to 27.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 from a net book value of 25.6 billion as of September 30, 2023. Our rental of flight equipment revenues increased as compared to the prior period primarily due to the growth of our fleet, partially offset by a decrease in end of lease revenue of approximately 12.4 million as compared to the prior period primarily due to fewer aircraft returns during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as well as a slight decrease in our lease yields due to the sales of older aircraft with higher lease yields and the purchases of new aircraft with lower initial lease yields. 
 
 Aircraft sales, trading and other revenue 
 
 Aircraft sales, trading and other revenue totaled 65.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 55.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 41.5 million in gains from the sale of nine aircraft and 8.0 million from two sales-type leases. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately 39.0 million in gains from the sale of eight aircraft and 5.0 million from one sales-type lease. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense totaled 217.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 175.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in our composite cost of funds to 4.21 as compared to 3.67 in the prior year period as well as an increase in our overall outstanding debt balance. We expect our interest expense will continue to increase as our average debt balance outstanding increases with the growth of our fleet. Our interest expense in future periods will also be impacted by increases or decreases in our composite cost of funds based on prevailing interest rates. 
 
 Depreciation expense 
 
 We recorded 290.1 million in depreciation expense of flight equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 267.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributable to the growth of our fleet. We expect our depreciation expense to increase as we continue to add aircraft to our fleet. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 We recorded selling, general and administrative expenses of 44.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 6.4 and 6.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Taxes 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 20.2 from 19.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our effective tax rate was driven by discrete items in the period and additional income taxes as a result of Pillar Two. On January 1, 2024, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Inclusive Framework, known as Pillar Two, became effective. Pillar Two established a global minimum effective tax rate of 15 . If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under Pillar Two is less than 15 , a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15 .

 Net income attributable to common stockholders 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of 91.6 million, or 0.82 per diluted share, compared to consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of 122.0 million, or 1.10 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior year period is primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by the increase in our composite cost of funds and overall outstanding debt balance partially offset by an increase in our revenues as discussed above. 
 
 Adjusted net income before income taxes 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded adjusted net income before income taxes of 140.2 million, or 1.25 per adjusted diluted share, compared to adjusted net income before income taxes of 177.0 million, or 1.59 per adjusted diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted net income before income taxes decreased primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by the increase in our composite cost of funds and overall outstanding debt balance, partially offset by the increase in our revenues as discussed above. 
 
 Adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes are measures of financial and operational performance that are not defined by GAAP. See Note 1 under the Results of Operations table above for a discussion of adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes as non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of these measures to net income attributable to common stockholders. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Rental revenue 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 1.85 billion in rental revenue, which included amortization expense, net of overhaul revenue related to initial direct costs of 19.8 million as compared to 1.83 billion in rental revenue, which included overhaul revenue, net of amortization expense related to initial direct costs of 40.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net book value of our flight equipment subject to operating lease was 27.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 25.6 billion as of September 30, 2023. Our rental of flight equipment revenues increased as compared to the prior period primarily due to the growth of our fleet, partially offset by a decrease in end of lease revenue of approximately 45.9 million as compared to the prior period primarily due to fewer aircraft returns during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Aircraft sales, trading and other revenue 
 
 Aircraft sales, trading and other revenue increased to 171.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 134.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 104.2 million in gains from the sale of 25 aircraft and 14.5 million from three sales-type leases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 92.5 million in gains from the sale of 18 aircraft and 5.1 million from one sales-type lease. In addition, we recorded 1.2 million in forfeiture of security deposit income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense totaled 615.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 526.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in our composite cost of funds to 4.21 as compared to 3.67 in the prior year period as well as an increase in our overall outstanding debt balance. We expect our interest expense to continue to increase as our average debt balance outstanding increases with the growth of our fleet. Our interest expense in future periods will also be impacted by increases or decreases in our composite cost of funds based on prevailing interest rates. 
 
 Depreciation expense 
 
 We recorded 849.4 million in depreciation expense of flight equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 795.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation expense for the nine 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributable to the growth of our fleet. We expect our depreciation expense to increase as we continue to add aircraft to our fleet. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 We recorded selling, general and administrative expenses of 137.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 136.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 6.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Taxes 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we reported an effective tax rate of 20.0 and 19.2 , respectively. The effective tax rate increase was driven by discrete items in the period and additional income taxes as a result of Pillar Two. On January 1, 2024, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Inclusive Framework, known as Pillar Two, became effective. Pillar Two established a global minimum effective tax rate of 15 . If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under Pillar Two is less than 15 , a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15 . 
 
 Net income attributable to common stockholders 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of 279.5 million, or 2.50 per diluted share, compared to a consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of 362.3 million, or 3.25 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior year period is primarily due to higher interest expense partially offset by an increase in our revenues, as discussed above. 
 
 Adjusted net income before income taxes 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded adjusted net income before income taxes of 423.8 million, or 3.79 per adjusted diluted share, compared to an adjusted net income before income taxes of 519.7 million, or 4.67 per adjusted diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted net income before income taxes decreased primarily due to higher interest expense partially offset by the increase in our revenues as discussed above. 
 
 Adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes are measures of financial and operational performance that are not defined by GAAP. See Note 1 under the Results of Operations table above for a discussion of adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes as non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of these measures to net income attributable to common stockholders.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting estimates reflecting management s estimates and judgments are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have reviewed recently adopted accounting pronouncements and determined that the adoption of such pronouncements is not expected to have a material impact, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, there have been no material changes to critical accounting estimates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument, caused by fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to the market risks described below. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates. Changes, both increases and decreases, in our cost of borrowing, as reflected in our composite interest rate, directly impact our net income. Lease rates, and therefore our revenue from a lease, are generally fixed over the life of our leases. We have some exposure to changing interest rates as a result of our floating-rate debt, primarily from our Revolving Credit Facility and bilateral term loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 3.9 billion and 3.0 billion in floating-rate debt outstanding, respectively. Additionally, we have outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate stated amount of 900.0 million as of November 7, 2024 which will reset the dividends to a new fixed rate based on the then-applicable treasury rate after five years from initial issuance and every five years thereafter. If interest rates remain elevated, we would be obligated to make higher interest payments to the lenders of our floating-rate debt, and higher dividend payments to the holders of our preferred stock. If we incur significant fixed-rate debt in the future, increased interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of the incurrence of such debt would also increase our interest expense. If the composite interest rate on our outstanding floating rate debt was to increase by 1.0 , we would expect to incur additional annual interest expense on our existing indebtedness of approximately 38.6 million and 29.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, each on an annualized basis, which would put downward pressure on our operating margins. 
 
 We also have interest rate risk on our forward lease placements. This is caused by us setting a fixed lease rate in advance of the delivery date of an aircraft. The delivery date is when a majority of the financing for an aircraft is arranged. To partially mitigate the risk of an increasing interest rate environment between the lease signing date and the delivery date of the aircraft, a majority of our forward lease contracts have manufacturer escalation protection and/or interest rate adjusters which would adjust the final lease rate upward or downward based on changes in the consumer price index or certain benchmark interest rates, respectively, at the time of delivery of the aircraft as compared to the lease signing date, subject to an outside limit on such adjustments. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 We attempt to minimize currency and exchange risks by entering into aircraft purchase agreements and a majority of lease agreements and debt agreements with U.S. dollars as the designated payment currency. Thus, most of our revenue and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Approximately 0.4 and 0.3 of our lease revenues were denominated in foreign currency as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, some of our net investments in sales-type leases, which represent 0.5 and 0.2 of our total assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were denominated in foreign currency. These investments are not currently hedged and require remeasurement as of the end of each period, exposing us to fluctuations in exchange rates that could impact our financial results and cash flows. We periodically assess our unhedged foreign currency risk and may employ hedging strategies in the future to mitigate any potential adverse effects. 
 
 Approximately 8.0 and 3.5 of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively; however, the exposure of such debt has been effectively hedged. As our principal currency is the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar as compared to other major currencies should not have a significant impact on our future operating results. However, many of our lessees are exposed to currency risk due to the fact that they earn revenues in their local currencies while a significant portion of their liabilities and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, including their lease payments to us, as well as fuel, debt service, and other expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, more than 95 of our revenues were derived from customers who have their principal place of business outside the U.S. and most leases designated payment currency is U.S. dollars. The ability of our lessees to make lease payments to us in U.S. dollars may be adversely impacted in the event of an appreciating U.S. dollar.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 In June 2022, we and certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, the Plaintiffs submitted insurance claims to the insurers on our aviation insurance policies (collectively, the Plaintiffs Insurers to recover losses relating to aircraft detained in Russia for which we recorded a net write-off of our interests in our owned and managed aircraft totaling approximately 771.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. On December 20, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed suit in the Los Angeles County Superior Court of the State of California seeking recovery of actual damages (subject to proof at trial) and declaratory relief against the Plaintiffs Insurers for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in connection with the Plaintiffs previously submitted insurance claims for which a trial date has been set for April 17, 2025. On December 21, 2023, certain Plaintiffs received cash insurance settlement proceeds of approximately US 64.9 million in settlement of their insurance claims under S7 s insurance policies in respect of four aircraft in our owned fleet on lease to S7 at the time of Russia s invasion of Ukraine. The receipt of these insurance settlement proceeds serves to mitigate, in part, such Plaintiffs losses under their aviation insurance policies. 
 
 On January 19, 2024, certain of the Plaintiffs filed suit in the High Court of Justice, Business Property Courts of England Wales, Commercial Court against the Russian airlines aviation insurers and reinsurance insurers (collectively, the Airlines Insurers seeking recovery under the Russian airlines insurance policies for certain aircraft that remain in Russia. The lawsuit against the Airlines Insurers is in the early stages and no trial date has been set. 
 
 We do not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow, as we recorded a write-off of our entire interest in our owned and managed aircraft detained in Russia during 2022 and any recovery in these lawsuits would be recorded as a gain in our financial statements. 
 
 In addition, from time to time, we may be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business in the ordinary course. Our industry is also subject to scrutiny by government regulators, which could result in enforcement proceedings or litigation related to regulatory compliance matters. We are not presently a party to any enforcement proceedings or litigation related to regulatory compliance matters. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate, based on the nature and risks of our business, historical experience and industry standards.
