 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries that are consolidated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are made in the calculation and assessment of the following: impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill; income taxes; allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivables; lease accounting estimates; contingencies; and stock-based compensation. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

In general, the leverage ratio is the Company's indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) divided by adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Indenture) for the four preceding quarterly periods. The complete definitions of all calculation elements of the leverage ratio are contained in the Indenture. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's leverage ratio was approximately x. As a result, quarterly principal payments on the 2019 Class A-2-II Notes of million currently are not required. 
 The Company may voluntarily repay the 2019 Class A-2-II Notes at any time without any associated make-whole premium. 
 2022 Class A-1 Notes 
 In August 2022, the Co-Issuers entered into the Credit Facility that allows for drawings up to million of variable funding notes on a revolving basis and the issuance of letters of credit. The applicable interest rate under the Credit Facility depends on the type of borrowing by the Co-Issuers. The applicable interest rate for advances is generally calculated at a per annum rate equal to the commercial paper funding rate or one-, two-, three- or six-month Term SOFR Rate, in either case, plus . The applicable interest rate for swingline advances and unreimbursed draws on outstanding letters of credit is a per annum base rate equal to the sum of (A) the greatest of (i) the Prime Rate in effect from time to time; (ii) the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time plus ; and (iii) Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect at such time plus plus (B) . 
 The legal final maturity of the Credit Facility is June 2052, but rapid amortization will apply if there are outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility after June 2027 (the Class A-1 Renewal Date ). The Class A-1 Renewal Date may be extended at the Co-Issuers election for up to successive periods if certain conditions are met. If the Co-Issuers have not repaid or refinanced the Credit Facility by the Class A-1 Renewal Date (after giving effect to any extensions), then interest will accrue on the Credit Facility at a rate equal to in addition to the regular interest rate applicable to the Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility was million. The amount of million was pledged against the Credit Facility for outstanding letters of credit, leaving million of the Credit Facility available for borrowing at September 30, 2024. It is anticipated that any principal and interest on the Credit Facility outstanding will be repaid in full on or prior to the quarterly payment date in June 2027, subject to additional extensions at the option of the Company upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The letters of credit are used primarily to satisfy insurance-related collateral requirements. The weighted average interest rate for the period outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was . 
 2023 Class A-2 Notes 
 The legal final maturity of the 2023 Class A-2 Notes is in March 2053, but it is anticipated that, unless repaid earlier to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the 2023 Class A-2 Notes will be repaid in June 2029 (the 2023 Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date ). If the Co-Issuers have not repaid or refinanced the 2023 Class A-2 Notes by the 2023 Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date, then additional interest will accrue on the 2023 Class A-2 Notes, as applicable, at the greater of: (A) and (B) the amount, if any, by which the sum of the following exceeds the Series 2023-1 Class A-2 Note interest rate: (x) the yield to maturity (adjusted to a quarterly bond-equivalent basis) on the 2023 Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date of the United States Treasury Security having a term closest to years plus (y) for the 2023 Class A-2 Notes. 
 While the 2023 Class A-2 Notes are outstanding, payment of principal and interest is required to be made on the 2023 Class A-2 Notes on a quarterly basis. The quarterly principal payment of million on the 2023 Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the leverage ratio for the Company and its subsidiaries is less than or equal to x. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's leverage ratio was approximately x. As a result, quarterly principal payments on the 2023 Class A-2 Notes of million currently are not required.

 million. The Company also would be subject to a make-whole premium in the event of a mandatory prepayment required following a Rapid Amortization Event or certain asset dispositions. The mandatory make-whole premium requirements are considered derivatives embedded in the Notes that must be bifurcated for separate valuation. The Company estimated the fair value of these derivatives to be immaterial as of September 30, 2024, based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with either event. 
 Repurchase Program 
 On February 16, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program of up to million. Repurchases of the Company s debt, if any, are expected to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption. Under the authorization, the Company may make repurchases of the Company's debt from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions upon such terms and at such prices as management may determine. 
 Covenants and Restrictions 
 The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including: (i) that the Co-Issuers maintain specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified call redemption premiums in the case of Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances; (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure of the Securitization Entities (as defined in the Indenture) to maintain the stated debt service coverage ratio DSCR ), the sum of domestic retail sales for all restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, certain events of default and the failure to repay or refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the anticipated repayment dates. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure of the Securitization Entities to maintain the stated DSCR, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties and certain judgments. 
 In general, the DSCR ratio is Net Cash Flow (as defined in the Indenture) for the four quarters preceding the calculation date divided by the total debt service payments (as defined in the Indenture) of the preceding four quarters. The complete definitions of the DSCR and all calculation elements are contained in the Indenture. Failure to maintain a prescribed DSCR can trigger a Cash Flow Sweeping Event, A Rapid Amortization Event, a Manager Termination Event or a Default Event (each as defined in the Indenture) as described below. In a Cash Flow Sweeping Event, the Trustee is required to retain of excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Indenture) in a restricted account. In a Rapid Amortization Event, all excess Cash Flow is retained and used to retire principal amounts of debt. In a Manager Termination Event, the Company may be replaced as manager of the assets securitized under the Indenture. In a Default Event, the outstanding principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest can be called to become immediately due and payable. Key DSCRs are as follows: 
 DSCR less than x - Cash Flow Sweeping Event 
 DSCR less than x - Rapid Amortization Event 
 Interest-only DSCR less than x - Manager Termination Event 
 Interest-only DSCR less than x - Default Event 
 The Company's DSCR for the reporting period ended September 30, 2024 was approximately x.

 Overview 
 Through various subsidiaries, we own and franchise the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill Bar Applebee's concept in the American full-service segment within the casual dining category of the restaurant industry, the International House of Pancakes IHOP concept in the mid-scale full-service restaurant segment within the family dining category of the restaurant industry, and the Fuzzy's Taco Shop Fuzzy's concept in the Mexican limited-service restaurant segment within the fast-casual dining category of the restaurant industry. References herein to Applebee's , IHOP and Fuzzy's Taco Shop restaurants are to these three restaurant concepts, whether operated by franchisees, area licensees and their sub-licensees (collectively, area licensees or by us. With over 3,500 restaurants, we believe we are one of the largest full-service restaurant companies in the world. 
 We identify our business segments based on the organizational units used by management to monitor performance and make operating decisions. We currently have six operating segments: Applebee's franchise operations, IHOP franchise operations, Fuzzy's franchise operations, rental operations, financing operations, and company-operated restaurant operations. We have four reportable segments: franchise operations (an aggregation of each restaurant concept's franchise operations), rental operations, financing operations, and company-operated restaurant operations.

 The following table highlights the primary components of the increase (decrease) in our income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to our income before income taxes for the comparable prior periods (in millions): 
 Favorable (Unfavorable) Variance Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Increase (decrease) in gross profit: Applebee's franchise operations 
 (1.4) (2.2) IHOP franchise operations

 Total gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared with the same period of the prior year due to decreased revenue from franchise and rental operations. Income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to decreased G A expenses, decreased impairment charges and decreased interest expense. The decrease in G A expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation-related expenses (predominantly incentive compensation), partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense. The decrease in impairment charges is primarily related to the impairment of four IHOP master land and building leases in the same period of the prior year. 
 Total gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared with the same period of the prior year due to decreased revenue from franchise and rental operations and increased franchisor advertising contribution. In addition, income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the prior year period due to increased interest expense, offset by a decrease in G A expenses, a loss on disposition of assets in the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest expense primarily related to higher-rate securitized notes and borrowings from our revolving line of credit. The decrease in G A expenses is primarily attributable to expenses related to the stopping of the IHOP Flip'd initiative in the same period of the prior year, a decrease in professional services, a decrease in occupancy costs, and a decrease in compensation-related expenses, offset by an increase in depreciation expense (see G A Expenses section below for further detail). The decrease in impairment charges is primarily related to the technology that was developed in connection with the IHOP Flip'd initiative that was stopped and the impairment of four IHOP master land and building leases in the same period of the prior year. 
 Increases in commodity, labor and other restaurant operating costs experienced at restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees could impact us to the extent our franchisees are adversely impacted by a sustained decline in their operating margins. At company operated restaurants, when applicable, increases in commodity, labor and other restaurant operating costs impact us directly. 
 See Consolidated Results of Operations - Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for additional discussion of the changes shown above. 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 In evaluating the performance of each restaurant concept, we consider the key performance indicators to be the system-wide sales percentage change, the percentage change in domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales domestic same-restaurant sales ), net franchise restaurant development and the change in effective restaurants. Changes in both domestic same-restaurant sales and in the number of Applebee's, IHOP and Fuzzy's restaurants will impact our system-wide retail sales that drive franchise royalty revenues. Restaurant development also impacts franchise revenues in the form of initial franchise fees and, in the case of IHOP and Fuzzy's restaurants, sales of proprietary products.

Restaurant Data 
 The following table sets forth the number of Effective Restaurants in the Applebee s, IHOP and Fuzzy's systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same period of the prior year. Sales at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the Company and, as such, the percentage change in sales at Effective Restaurants is based on non-GAAP sales data. However, we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are based on a percentage of their sales, and, where applicable, rental payments under leases that partially may be based on a percentage of their sales. Management also uses this information to make decisions about plans for future development of additional restaurants as well as evaluation of current operations.

 (a) Effective Restaurants are the weighted average number of restaurants open in each fiscal period, adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period. Information is presented for all Effective Restaurants in the Applebee s, IHOP and Fuzzy's systems, which consist of restaurants owned by franchisees and area licensees as well as those owned by the Company. Effective Restaurants do not include units operated as ghost kitchens (small kitchens with no store-front presence, used to fill off-premise orders).

 (b) System-wide sales are retail sales at Applebee s and Fuzzy's restaurants operated by franchisees and IHOP restaurants operated by franchisees and area licensees, as reported to the Company, in addition to retail sales at company-operated Fuzzy's restaurants. System-wide sales do not include retail sales of ghost kitchens. Sales at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the Company. An increase in franchisees' reported sales will result in a corresponding increase in our royalty revenue, while a decrease in franchisees' reported sales will result in a corresponding decrease in our royalty revenue. Unaudited reported sales for Applebee's and Fuzzy's franchise restaurants, Fuzzy's company-operated restaurants, IHOP franchise restaurants and IHOP area license restaurants were as follows:

 (c) Sales percentage change reflects, for each category of restaurants, the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal period compared to the prior period for all restaurants in that category. 
 (d) Domestic same-restaurant sales percentage change reflects the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal period, compared to the same weeks in the prior period, for domestic restaurants that have been operated during both periods that are being compared and have been open for at least 18 months. Because of new restaurant openings and restaurant closures, the domestic restaurants open throughout both fiscal periods being compared may be different from period to period.

 The restaurant counts and activity presented above include 13 dual-branded international Applebee's and IHOP restaurants at September 30, 2024, and six dual-branded international Applebee's and IHOP restaurants at September 30, 2023, which are tabulated in both brands activities. Dual-branded restaurants are defined as restaurants that run two of our concepts and share an entrance, front of the house staff and a kitchen. The restaurant counts and activity presented above do not include one domestic Applebee's ghost kitchen (small kitchens with no store-front presence, used to fill off-premise orders), seven international Applebee's ghost kitchens and 34 international IHOP ghost kitchens. 
 The closures presented in the tables above represent permanent closures of restaurants. Temporary closures, which can occur for a variety of reasons, are not reflected as reductions in this table and are included in the summary counts at the beginning and end of each period shown. Temporary closures are reflected in the weighted calculation of Effective Restaurants presented in the preceding Restaurant Data table. 
 Closures of restaurants adversely impact our system-wide retail sales that drive our franchise royalty revenues as well as, in the case of IHOP and Fuzzy's restaurants, sales of proprietary products. Further, with certain restaurants, we own or lease the underlying property and sublease it to the applicable franchisee. Thus, our rental income also could be adversely affected due to the loss of such income, as well as our obligation to make rental or other payments for such properties. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared with the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in franchise and rental operations revenue. The decrease in franchise operations revenue was primarily attributable to the decrease in domestic same-restaurant sales and the decrease in the number of Applebee's and Fuzzy's effective restaurants, partially offset by increases in the number of effective restaurants and proprietary product sales at IHOP. Rental operations revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared with the same period of the prior year, primarily due to operating lease terminations and a decrease in percentage rent. Rental operations revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared with the same period of the prior year, primarily due to prior year lease buyouts and operating lease terminations.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, company restaurant operations consisted of three Fuzzy's restaurants that were acquired in December 2022, of which two were subsequently refranchised in the second quarter of 2023. Company segment restaurant expenses may include costs associated with reacquired restaurants in the process of being refranchised. There were no reacquired restaurants expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Financing revenues primarily consist of interest income from the financing of IHOP equipment leases and franchise fees as well as interest income on notes receivable due from franchisees. Financing expenses are sales and use taxes related to IHOP equipment leases. Financing revenue and gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined compared to the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to progressive decline in interest income as note balances are repaid.

 Interest expense, net and loss on extinguishment of debt 
 Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was slightly lower than the same period of the prior year, primarily due to lower interest expense from less borrowings under the revolving Credit Facility as well as an increase in interest income. 
 Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to the higher interest rate on our refinanced securitized notes as well as on our Credit Facility, partially offset by the increase in interest income from improved yields. 
 The Company repaid the entire outstanding balance of approximately 585.1 million of its 2019 Class A-2 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and recognized a 1.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt from the write-off of the related remaining issuance costs. This loss was offset by a 1.7 million gain on extinguishment of debt from the purchase of 67.9 million of its 2019 Class A-2 Notes under par during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss (gain) on disposition of assets 
 The loss on disposition of assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the disposition of certain IHOP Flip'd assets. 
 Income Taxes Three Months Ended September 30, Favorable (Unfavorable) Variance Nine Months Ended September 30, Favorable (Unfavorable) Variance 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Income before income taxes 26.5 24.9 1.5 81.7 85.6 (3.8) Income tax provision 7.4 6.5 (0.9) 22.0 21.4 (0.6) Effective tax rate 28.0 25.9 (2.0) 26.9 25.0 (1.9) 
 Our income tax provision or benefit will vary from period to period in our normal course of business for two reasons: a change in income before income taxes and a change in the effective tax rate. Changes in our income before income taxes were addressed in the preceding sections of Consolidated Results of Operations - Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023." 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the rate of the comparable prior periods primarily due to a lower tax deduction related to stock-based compensation. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Key provisions of our long-term debt potentially impacting liquidity are summarized below. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt , of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail on long-term debt, including the balances outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Instruments 
 Our long-term debt includes two series of fixed rate senior secured notes, the Series 2019-1 4.723 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes in an initial aggregate principal amount of 600 million (the 2019 Class A-2-II Notes and the Series 2023-1 7.824 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million (the 2023 Class A-2 Notes and, together with the 2019 Class A-2-II Notes, the Class A-2 Notes ). The Series 2019-1 4.194 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the Class A-2-I Notes were voluntarily repaid in full on April 17, 2023. For a description

Table of Contents 

 of the 2019 Class A-2-I Notes, refer to Note 8 Long-Term Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Our long-term debt also includes a revolving financing facility, the 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes, Class A-1 (the Credit Facility that allows for drawings up to 325 million of variable funding notes on a revolving basis and the issuance of letters of credit. 
 Maturity 
 The final maturity of the 2019 Class A-2-II Notes is in June 2049, but it is anticipated that, unless repaid earlier, the 2019 Class A-2-II Notes will be repaid in June 2026. 
 The final maturity of the 2023 Class A-2 Notes is in March 2053, but it is anticipated that, unless repaid earlier, to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the 2023 Class A-2 Notes will be repaid in June 2029. 
 The renewal date of the Credit Facility is June 2027, subject to two additional one-year extensions at the option of the Company upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 Payment of Principal and Interest 
 While the Class A-2 Notes are outstanding, payment of principal and interest is required to be made on the Class A-2 Notes on a quarterly basis. The payment of principal on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the leverage ratio for the Company and its subsidiaries is less than or equal to 5.25x. As of September 30, 2024, our leverage ratio was approximately 4.1x. Therefore, quarterly principal payments are not required. 
 Exceeding the leverage ratio of 5.25x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes. 
 On February 16, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program of up to 100 million. Repurchases of the Company s debt, if any, are expected to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption. Under the authorization, the Company may make repurchases of the Company's debt from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions upon such terms and at such prices as management may determine. 
 Make-whole Premiums 
 We may voluntarily repay the Class A-2 Notes at any time; however, if repaid prior to certain dates we would be required to pay make-whole premiums. As of September 30, 2024, there was no make-whole premium associated with voluntary prepayment of the 2019 Class A-2-II Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the make-whole premium associated with voluntary prepayment of the 2023 Class A-2 Notes was approximately 37.8 million. We also would be subject to a make-whole premium in the event of a mandatory prepayment required following certain rapid amortization events or certain asset dispositions. The mandatory make-whole premium requirements are considered derivatives embedded that must be bifurcated for separate valuation. We estimated the fair value of these derivatives to be immaterial as of September 30, 2024, based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with either event. 
 Covenants and Restrictions 
 Our long-term debt is subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including maintenance of a debt service coverage ratio ("DSCR"). In general, the DSCR ratio is net cash flow for the four quarters preceding the calculation date divided by the total debt service payments of the preceding four quarters. The complete definitions of the DSCR and all calculation elements are contained in the indenture, and subsequent amendments thereto, under which the Class A-2 Notes were issued. 
 Failure to maintain a prescribed DSCR can trigger the following events: 
 DSCR less than 1.75x - Cash Flow Sweeping Event 
 DSCR less than 1.20x - Rapid Amortization Event 
 Interest-only DSCR less than 1.20x - Manager Termination Event 
 Interest-only DSCR less than 1.10x - Default Event 
 Our DSCR for the reporting period ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 3.5x. 
 Credit Facility 
 In August 2022, the Co-Issuers entered into the Credit Facility that allows for drawings up to 325 million of variable funding notes on a revolving basis and the issuance of letters of credit. The applicable interest rate under the Credit Facility depends on the type of borrowing by the Co-Issuers. The applicable interest rate for advances is generally calculated at a per 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 annum rate equal to the commercial paper funding rate or one-, two-, three- or six-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), in either case, plus 2.50 . The applicable interest rate for swingline advances and unreimbursed draws on outstanding letters of credit is a per annum base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect from time to time; (ii) the federal funds rate in effect from time to time plus 0.50 ; and (iii) SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect at such time plus 0.50 plus (b) 2.00 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility was 100 million. The amount of 0.6 million was pledged against the Credit Facility for outstanding letters of credit, leaving 224.4 million of the Credit Facility available for borrowing at September 30, 2024. It is anticipated that any principal and interest on the Credit Facility outstanding will be repaid in full on or prior to the quarterly payment date in June 2027, subject to two additional one-year extensions at the option of the Company upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The letters of credit are used primarily to satisfy insurance-related collateral requirements. The weighted average interest rate on Credit Facility borrowings for the period outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.93 . 
 Capital Allocation 
 Dividends 
 Dividends declared and paid per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Dividends declared per common share 0.51 0.51 1.53 1.53 Dividends paid per common share 0.51 1.02 1.53 2.04 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid dividends of 23.5 million and 31.7 million, respectively. 
 On February 26, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2024 cash dividend of 0.51 per share of common stock, paid on April 5, 2024 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2024. 
 On May 14, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2024 cash dividend of 0.51 per share of common stock, paid on July 5, 2024 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 20, 2024. 
 On September 5, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 cash dividend of 0.51 per share of common stock, paid on October 8, 2024 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 20, 2024. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 On February 17, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, effective April 1, 2022, of up to 250 million (the 2022 Repurchase Program ). 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 269,621 shares of common stock at a cost of 12.0 million. Cumulatively, the Company has repurchased 1,865,399 shares at a cost of 116.7 million under the 2022 Repurchase Program. 
 From time to time, we also repurchase shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards. Shares are deemed purchased at the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date. See Part II, Item 2 for detail on this stock repurchase activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 In summary, our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 77.7 79.3 (1.6) Net cash used in investing activities (0.7) (26.6) 25.9 Net cash used in financing activities (42.5) (218.0) 175.5 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 34.5 (165.3) 199.8 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees, and profit from our rental operations, financing operations and our company-owned restaurant. Cash provided by operating activities decreased 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross segment profit partially offset by a decrease in G A expenses, as discussed in the preceding sections of this MD A, and a favorable increase in working capital. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities used net cash of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used by investing activities of 25.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by an increase in principal receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivables. The Company increased spending in information technology and other projects in fiscal year 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities used net cash of 42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cash used by financing activities of 175.5 million was primarily due to the repayment and issuance of long-term debt of 159.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in dividends paid due to timing and a 8.0 million decrease in repurchase of common stock. There was no repayment or issuance of long-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 We define adjusted free cash flow for a given period as cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contract receivables, less additions to property and equipment. Management uses this liquidity measure in its periodic assessment of, among other things, payment of cash dividends on common stock and repurchases of common stock and we believe it is important for investors to have the same measure used by management for that purpose. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes. 
 Adjusted free cash flow is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. This non-U.S. GAAP measure is not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the U.S. GAAP information contained within our financial statements. Reconciliation of the cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow is as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance (In millions) Cash flows provided by operating activities 77.7 79.3 (1.6) Principal receipts from notes and equipment contracts 10.4 6.7 3.7 Additions to property and equipment (10.3) (32.0) 21.7 Adjusted free cash flow 77.8 54.0 23.8 
 Adjusted free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 improved compared to the same period of the prior year due to the decrease in capital expenditures and an increase in principal receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There were no material changes to the contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. We continually review the estimates and underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

 Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subject to various lawsuits, administrative proceedings, audits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these lawsuits purport to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. We are required to record an accrual for litigation loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Legal fees and expenses associated with the defense of all of our litigation are expensed as such fees and expenses are incurred. Management regularly assesses our insurance deductibles, analyzes litigation information with our attorneys and evaluates our loss experience in connection with pending legal proceedings. While we do not presently believe that any of the legal proceedings to which we are currently a party will ultimately have a material adverse impact on us, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in all the proceedings we are party to, or that we will not incur material losses from them.
