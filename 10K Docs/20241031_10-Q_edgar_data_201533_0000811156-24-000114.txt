 CMS Energy Corporation 
 Consumers Energy Company 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 This MD A is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 
 CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and NorthStar Clean Energy, primarily a domestic independent power producer and marketer. Consumers electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. NorthStar Clean Energy, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, including the development and operation of renewable generation, and the marketing of independent power production. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and NorthStar Clean Energy, its non utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility. CMS Energy s and Consumers businesses are affected primarily by: 
 regulation and regulatory matters 
 state and federal legislation 
 economic conditions 
 weather 
 energy commodity prices 
 interest rates 
 their securities credit ratings 
 
 The Triple Bottom Line 
 CMS Energy s and Consumers purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. In support of this purpose, CMS Energy and Consumers employ the CE Way, a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that CMS Energy and Consumers create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line balances the interests of employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, Michigan s residents, 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of CMS Energy s and Consumers activities. 
 
 CMS Energy s Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes CMS Energy s and Consumers progress toward world class performance measured in the areas of people, planet, and profit. 
 
 People: The people element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy s and Consumers commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which they do business, and other stakeholders. 
 The safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. Over the last ten years, Consumers Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incident rate has decreased by 20 percent. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. Consumers customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability. 
 In September 2023, Consumers filed its Reliability Roadmap, an update to its previous Electric Distribution Infrastructure Investment Plan filed in 2021, with the MPSC. The Reliability Roadmap outlines a five-year strategy to improve Consumers electric distribution system and the reliability of the grid. The plan proposes the following spending for projects designed to reduce the number and duration of power outages to customers through investment in infrastructure upgrades, vegetation management, and grid modernization: 
 capital expenditures of 7 billion over the next five years; this amount is 3 billion higher than proposed in the previous plan 
 maintenance and operating spending of 1.7 billion over the next five years, reflecting an increase of 300 million over the previous plan 
 In the electric rate case it filed in May 2024, Consumers outlined its proposal to begin implementing the Reliability Roadmap and requested rate recovery of the investments needed to support the plan s key objectives.

Table of Contents 

 Central to Consumers commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable, including: 
 replacement of coal-fueled generation and PPAs with a cost-efficient mix of renewable energy, less-costly dispatchable generation sources, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs 
 targeted infrastructure investment to reduce maintenance costs and improve reliability and safety 
 supply chain optimization 
 economic development to increase sales and reduce overall rates 
 information and control system efficiencies 
 employee and retiree health care cost sharing 
 tax planning 
 cost-effective financing 
 workforce productivity enhancements 
 While CMS Energy and Consumers have experienced some supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, they have taken steps to mitigate the impact on their ability to provide safe and reliable service to customers. 
 
 Planet: The planet element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy s and Consumers commitment to protect the environment. This commitment extends beyond compliance with various state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Management considers climate change and other environmental risks in strategy development, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to protect the environment and reduce their carbon footprint from owned generation. CMS Energy, including Consumers, has decreased its combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal by 25 percentage points since 2015. Additionally, as a result of actions already taken through 2023, Consumers has: 
 reduced carbon dioxide emissions from owned generation by nearly 40 percent since 2005 
 reduced methane emissions by more than 25 percent since 2012 
 reduced the volume of water used to generate electricity by more than 50 percent since 2012 
 reduced landfill waste disposal by more than 1.8 million tons since 1992 
 enhanced, restored, or protected more than 8,800 acres of land since 2017

 Since 2005, Consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions by more than 95 percent and its NOx emissions by nearly 88 percent. Consumers began tracking mercury emissions in 2007; since that time, it has reduced such emissions by nearly 93 percent. 
 In November 2023, Michigan enacted the 2023 Energy Law, which among other things: 
 raises the renewable energy standard from the present 15 percent requirement to 50 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035; renewable energy generated anywhere within MISO may be applied to meeting this standard, with certain limitations 
 sets a clean energy standard of 80 percent by 2035 and 100 percent by 2040; low- or zero-carbon emitting resources, such as nuclear generation and natural gas generation coupled with carbon capture, are considered clean energy sources under this standard 
 enhances existing incentives for energy efficiency programs and returns earned on competitively bid PPAs 
 creates a new energy storage standard that requires electric utilities to file plans by 2029 to obtain new energy storage that will contribute to a Michigan target of 2,500 MW based on their pro rata share 
 expands the statutory cap on distributed generation resources to ten percent 
 Consumers is required to file updates to its amended renewable energy plan in November 2024 and its Clean Energy Plan before or in 2027. Together, these updated plans will outline a path to meeting the requirements of the 2023 Energy Law by focusing on increasing the generation of renewable energy, deploying energy storage, helping customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times. 
 Consumers Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers long-term energy needs and was most recently revised and approved by the MPSC in 2022 under Michigan s integrated resource planning process. The Clean Energy Plan outlines Consumers long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy to its customers. This strategy includes: 
 ending the use of coal in owned generation in 2025, 15 years sooner than initially planned 
 purchasing the Covert Generating Station, a natural gas-fueled generating facility with 1,200 MW of nameplate capacity, allowing Consumers to continue to provide controllable sources of electricity to customers; this purchase was completed in May 2023 
 soliciting up to 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025 
 expanding its investment in renewable energy, adding nearly 8,000 MW of solar generation by 2040 
 Under the Clean Energy Plan, and as enhanced by the 2023 Energy Law, Consumers earns a return equal to its pre-tax weighted-average cost of capital on permanent capital structure on payments made under new competitively bid PPAs with non affiliated entities approved by the MPSC.

 Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2021 capacity portfolio and its future capacity portfolio under its Clean Energy Plan, which does not yet incorporate the requirements of the 2023 Energy Law. This illustration includes the effects of purchased capacity and customer programs and uses the nameplate capacity for all energy sources: 
 
 1 Does not include RECs. 
 2 Includes energy waste reduction, demand response, and conservation voltage reduction programs. 
 3 These amounts and fuel sources will vary and are dependent on a one time competitive solicitation to acquire up to 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025. 
 In addition to Consumers plan to eliminate its use of coal in owned generation in 2025, CMS Energy and Consumers have set the net zero emissions goals discussed below. 
 Net-zero methane emissions from natural gas delivery system by 2030: Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent, from 2012 baseline levels, by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. To date, Consumers has reduced methane emissions by more than 25 percent. 
 Net-zero carbon emissions from electric business by 2040: This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. Consumers expects to meet 90 percent of its customers needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its Clean Energy Plan. New technologies and carbon offset measures may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for the entire business by 2050: This goal incorporates greenhouse gas emissions from Consumers natural gas delivery system, including suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. Consumers expects to meet this goal through carbon offset measures, renewable natural gas, energy efficiency and demand response programs, and the adoption of cost-effective emerging technologies once proven and commercially available. 
 Additionally, to advance its environmental stewardship in Michigan and to minimize the impact of future regulations, Consumers set the following goals for the five-year period 2023 through 2027: 
 to enhance, restore, or protect 6,500 acres of land through 2027; Consumers has enhanced, restored, or protected more than 2,000 acres of land towards this goal 
 to reduce water usage by 1.7 billion gallons through 2027; Consumers has reduced water usage by more than 660 million gallons towards this goal 
 to annually divert a minimum of 90 percent of waste from landfills (through waste reduction, recycling, and reuse); during 2023, Consumers rate of waste diverted from landfills was 91 percent 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring numerous legislative, policy, and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate and report greenhouse gases, and related litigation. While CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could affect them materially, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean and lean strategy. 
 
 Profit: The profit element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy s and Consumers commitment to meeting their financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. CMS Energy s and Consumers financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to attract and retain talent, and to reinvest in the communities they serve. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CMS Energy s net income available to common stockholders was 731 million, and diluted EPS were 2.45. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of 571 million and diluted EPS of 1.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In 2024, electric and gas rate increases and higher earnings at NorthStar Clean Energy were offset partially by higher interest charges and increased depreciation and property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS Energy s and Consumers performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview. 
 Over the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized electric deliveries to increase and weather-normalized gas deliveries to remain stable relative to 2023. This outlook reflects modest growth in electric and gas demand, offset partially by the effects of energy waste reduction programs.

 Performance: Impacting the Triple Bottom Line 
 CMS Energy and Consumers remain committed to achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service and positively impacting the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit. During the first nine months of 2024, CMS Energy and Consumers: 
 created a Clean Energy Workforce Development Program for people employed in the building trades to receive training and certifications in the areas of advanced energy efficiency, lead abatement, and other work 
 buried power lines in multiple Michigan communities under a targeted undergrounding pilot program in efforts to improve electric service for Consumers electric customers 
 announced plans to install nearly 3,000 line sensors, 100 automatic transfer reclosers, and 1,200 iron utility poles to improve electric reliability and help prevent power outages 
 expanded Consumers MI Clean Air program to include several renewable natural gas projects being developed across Michigan, increasing options for customers to offset emissions associated with their natural gas use 
 collaborated with the Muskegon County Resource Recovery Center to develop a 250-MW solar energy center, Consumers first large-scale, self-developed solar project, that is expected to power 40,000 homes by 2026 
 updated Consumers Transportation Electrification Plan, aiming to power over 1,500 new fast charging locations and serve one million electric vehicles in Michigan by 2030 
 launched a new workplace electric vehicle charging program, offering rebates to businesses that install chargers, with a goal of equipping over 500 workplaces by 2030 
 CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to utilize the CE Way to enable them to achieve world class performance and positively impact the triple bottom line. Consumers investment plan and the regulatory environment in which it operates also drive its ability to impact the triple bottom line. 
 
 Investment Plan: Over the next five years, Consumers expects to make significant expenditures on infrastructure upgrades, replacements, and clean generation. While it has a large number of potential investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has prioritized its spending based on the criteria of enhancing public safety, increasing reliability, maintaining affordability for its customers, and advancing its environmental stewardship. Consumers investment program, which is subject to approval through general rate case and other MPSC proceedings, is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of more than seven percent. This rate-base growth, together with cost-control measures, should allow Consumers to maintain affordable customer prices.

Table of Contents 

 Presented in the following illustration are Consumers planned capital expenditures through 2028 of 17.0 billion: 
 
 Of this amount, Consumers plans to spend 13.6 billion over the next five years primarily to maintain and upgrade its electric distribution systems and gas infrastructure in order to enhance safety and reliability, improve customer satisfaction, reduce energy waste on those systems, and facilitate its clean energy transformation. Electric distribution and other projects comprise 7.3 billion primarily to strengthen circuits and substations, replace poles, and interconnect clean energy resources. The gas infrastructure projects comprise 6.3 billion to sustain deliverability, enhance pipeline integrity and safety, and reduce methane emissions. Consumers also expects to spend 3.4 billion on clean generation, which includes investments in wind, solar, and hydroelectric generation resources. 
 
 Regulation: Regulatory matters are a key aspect of Consumers business, particularly rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC, which permit recovery of new investments while helping to ensure that customer rates are fair and affordable. Important regulatory events and developments not already discussed are summarized below. 
 2024 Electric Rate Case: In May 2024, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of 325 million, made up of two components. First, Consumers requested a 303 million annual rate increase, based on a 10.25 percent authorized return on equity for the projected 12 month period ending February 28, 2026. The filing requested authority to recover costs related to new infrastructure investment primarily in distribution system reliability and cleaner energy resources. Second, Consumers requested approval of a 22 million surcharge for the recovery of distribution investments made in 2023 that exceeded the rates authorized in accordance with previous electric rate orders. In October 2024, Consumers revised its requested increase to 277 million. 
 2023 Electric Rate Case : In March 2024, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual rate increase of 92 million, which is inclusive of a 9 million surcharge for the recovery of select distribution investments made in 2022 that exceeded the rates authorized in accordance with the December 2021

 electric rate order. The approved rate increase is based on a 9.9-percent authorized return on equity. The new rates became effective March 15, 2024. 
 2023 Gas Rate Case: In December 2023, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of 136 million based on a 10.25 percent authorized return on equity for the projected test year comprising the 12 month period ending September 30, 2025. In May 2024, Consumers revised its requested increase to 113 million. In July 2024, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of 35 million, based on a 9.9 percent authorized return on equity. Additionally, the settlement approves the use of 27.5 million, or one-fourth, of the gain on the sale of Consumers unregulated ASP business as an offset to the revenue deficiency in lieu of additional rate relief during the test year. This results in effective rate relief of 62.5 million for the test year. The settlement agreement also provides for the remaining three-fourths of the 110 million gain on the sale of the ASP business, or 82.5 million, to be provided to customers as a bill credit over a three-year period. The new rates, including the bill credit, became effective October 1, 2024. 
 
 Looking Forward 
 CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. Consumers will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment that will support its customer-driven investment plan, while pursuing cost-control measures that will allow it to maintain sustainable customer base rates. The CE Way is an important means of realizing CMS Energy s and Consumers purpose of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.

 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 CMS Energy and Consumers expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund their present and future commitments. CMS Energy uses dividends and tax-sharing payments from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMS Energy s subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMS Energy depends upon each subsidiary s revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its articles of incorporation and potentially by FERC requirements and provisions under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act. For additional details on Consumers dividend restrictions, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3, Financings and Capitalization Dividend Restrictions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Consumers paid 544 million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy. 
 Consumers uses cash flows generated from operations, external financing transactions, and the monetization of tax credits, along with stockholder contributions from CMS Energy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. Consumers also uses these sources of funding to contribute to its employee benefit plans. 
 Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, renewable energy tax credits produced after 2022 are transferable to third parties. In April 2024, Consumers sold renewable energy tax credits generated in 2023 and received proceeds of 37 million. In June 2024, Consumers entered into an agreement to sell renewable energy tax credits generated in 2024 for 51 million, subject to adjustment for actual production. 
 Financing and Capital Resources: CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets to fund their robust capital plan. Barring any sustained market dislocations or disruptions, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets and will continue to explore possibilities to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise with respect to future funding needs. If access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, CMS Energy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending. 
 In 2023, CMS Energy entered into an equity offering program under which it may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 1 billion in privately negotiated transactions, in at the market offerings, or through forward sales transactions. There have been no sales of securities under this program. 
 CMS Energy, NorthStar Clean Energy, and Consumers use revolving credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. In May 2024, NorthStar Clean Energy entered into a secured revolving credit agreement which provides for up to 150 million in borrowings. At September 30, 2024, CMS Energy had 520 million of its revolving credit facility available and Consumers had 1.3 billion available under its revolving credit facilities. 
 In September 2024, CMS Energy entered into a delayed-draw 400 million unsecured term loan credit facility. The term loan matures in September 2025. CMS Energy has until December 2024 to draw funds under the facility. At September 30, 2024, CMS Energy had not drawn on this facility. In October 2024, CMS Energy borrowed 175 million under the term loan credit facility. 
 An additional source of liquidity is Consumers commercial paper program, which allows Consumers to issue, in one or more placements, up to 500 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days at market interest rates. These issuances are supported by

Table of Contents 

 Consumers revolving credit facilities. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the available capacity of the revolving credit facilities, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available capacity of the facilities. At September 30, 2024, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program. 
 For additional details about these programs and facilities, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3, Financings and Capitalization. 
 Certain of CMS Energy s, NorthStar Clean Energy s, and Consumers credit agreements contain covenants that require each entity to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. At September 30, 2024, no default had occurred with respect to any of the financial covenants contained in these credit agreements. Each of the entities was in compliance with the covenants contained in their respective credit agreements as of September 30, 2024, as presented in the following table:

 Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties 
 Clean Energy Plan: Consumers Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. Under this net-zero goal, Consumers plans to eliminate the impact of carbon emissions created by the electricity it generates or purchases for customers. Additionally, through its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers continues to make progress on expanding its customer programs, namely its demand response, energy efficiency, and conservation voltage reduction programs, as well as increasing its renewable energy generation. 
 The Clean Energy Plan was most recently revised and approved by the MPSC in 2022. Under this plan, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal in owned generation in 2025 and expects to meet 90 percent of its customers needs with clean energy sources by 2040. Specifically, the Clean Energy Plan provides for: 
 the retirement of the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units, totaling 515 MW of nameplate capacity; these units closed in June 2023 
 the retirement of the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units, totaling 1,407 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2025 
 the retirement of the D.E. Karn oil and gas-fueled generating units, totaling 1,219 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2031 
 The MPSC authorized Consumers to issue securitization bonds to finance the recovery of and return on the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units; Consumers issued these bonds in December 2023. Additionally, the MPSC has authorized regulatory asset treatment for Consumers to recover the remaining book value of the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units, as well as a 9.0 percent return on equity, commencing in 2025. 
 Under the Clean Energy Plan, Consumers: 
 purchased the Covert Generating Station, a natural gas-fueled generating facility with 1,200 MW of nameplate capacity in Van Buren County, Michigan in May 2023 
 conducted a one time competitive solicitation for up to 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025 (including up to 500 MW from dispatchable sources) 
 These actions are expected to help Consumers continue to provide controllable sources of electricity to customers while expanding its investment in renewable energy. The Clean Energy Plan forecasts renewable energy capacity levels of 30 percent in 2025, 43 percent in 2030, and 61 percent in 2040, including the addition of nearly 8,000 MW of solar generation. Additionally, the Clean Energy Plan forecasts deployment of battery storage beginning in 2024, with 75 MW of energy storage expected by 2027 and an additional 475 MW by 2040. The 2023 Energy Law, enacted in November 2023, set more ambitious standards for renewable energy and energy storage. Consumers is required to file updates to its amended renewable energy plan in November 2024 and its Clean Energy Plan before or in 2027. Together, these updated plans will outline a path to meeting these accelerated timelines. 
 Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers bids new capacity competitively and expects to own and operate approximately 50 percent of new capacity, with the remainder being built and owned by third parties. Additionally, Consumers earns a return equal to its pre-tax weighted-average cost of capital on permanent capital structure on payments made under new competitively bid PPAs with non affiliated entities approved by the MPSC.

 As a result of requests for proposals, Consumers has entered into PPAs to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from solar generating facilities and battery storage facilities, as well as build transfer agreements to purchase solar generating facilities. Presented in the following illustration is the aggregate renewable capacity that Consumers expects to add to its portfolio as a result of these agreements: 
 
 Consumers continues to evaluate the acquisition of additional capacity from intermittent resources and dispatchable, non intermittent clean capacity resources (including battery storage resources). Any resulting contracts are subject to MPSC approval. 
 Renewable Energy Plan: The 2023 Energy Law raises the renewable energy standard from the present 15 percent requirement to 50 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035. Consumers is required to file updates to its amended renewable energy plan in November 2024; this plan will outline a path to meeting the higher renewable energy standards. 
 In order to comply with the present 15-percent renewable energy requirement, Consumers is required to submit RECs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource, in an amount equal to at least the required percentage of Consumers electric sales volume each year. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers has met and expects to continue to meet its renewable energy requirement each year with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years. 
 The MPSC approved the acquisition of up to 525 MW of new wind generation projects and authorized Consumers to earn a 10.7 percent return on equity on projects constructed to meet the present 15 percent renewable energy standard. Specifically, the MPSC approved the following: 
 purchase and construction of a 150 MW wind generation project in Gratiot County, Michigan; the project became operational and Consumers took full ownership in 2020 
 purchase of a 166 MW wind generation project in Hillsdale, Michigan; the project became operational and Consumers took full ownership in 2021 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 purchase of a 201 MW wind generation project in Gratiot County, Michigan; the project became operational and Consumers took full ownership of the project in December 2023 
 The MPSC also approved the execution of a 20 year PPA under which Consumers will purchase 100 MW of renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 149 MW solar generating facility in Calhoun County, Michigan; the facility became operational in October 2024. 
 Renewable Energy Program: Consumers provides service under a program that provides full-service electric customers with the opportunity to advance the development of renewable energy beyond the present 15 percent requirement. In August 2024, the MPSC approved Consumers application to amend its renewable energy plan. This approval removed the 1,000 MW limit on new wind and solar generation, enabling Consumers to meet growing customer demand for the program. Consumers competitively solicits additional renewable energy assets based on customer applications. 
 As part of this program, a 2022 request for proposals resulted in the execution of a build transfer agreement for a 309 MW solar generating facility to be constructed in Calhoun County, Michigan; the facility is targeted to be operational in 2026. The build transfer agreement was approved by the MPSC in September 2023. Additionally, the request for proposals resulted in the selection of a solar generation project that Consumers will develop and construct at its D.E. Karn generating site, with a capacity of up to 85 MW. The facility is expected to be operational in 2026. 
 Electric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers electric customer deliveries are seasonal and largely dependent on Michigan s economy. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Each year in June, electric residential customers transition to a summer peak time-of-use rate that allows them to take advantage of lower-cost energy during off-peak times during the summer months. Thus, customers can reduce their electric bills by shifting their consumption from on peak to off peak times. 
 Over the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized electric deliveries to increase compared to 2023. This outlook reflects modest growth in electric demand, offset partially by the effects of energy waste reduction programs. Actual delivery levels will depend on: 
 energy conservation measures and results of energy waste reduction programs 
 weather fluctuations 
 Michigan s economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of large commercial and industrial facilities, economic development, population trends, electric vehicle adoption, and housing activity 
 Electric ROA: Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers sales, with certain exceptions. At September 30, 2024, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten percent limit. Fewer than 300 of Consumers electric customers purchased electric generation service under the ROA program. 
 In 2016, Michigan law established a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. The law also authorized the MPSC to ensure that alternative electric suppliers have procured enough capacity to cover their anticipated capacity requirements for the four year forward period. In 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for Consumers. Under this mechanism, if an alternative electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four year 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier. 
 During 2017, the MPSC issued orders finding that it has statutory authority to determine and implement a local clearing requirement, which requires all electric suppliers to demonstrate that a portion of the capacity used to serve customers is located in the MISO footprint in Michigan s Lower Peninsula. In 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the MPSC s statutory authority to implement a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers. 
 In 2020, ABATE and another intervenor filed a complaint against the MPSC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan challenging the constitutionality of a local clearing requirement. The complaint requests the federal court to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the MPSC from implementing a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers. In February 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissed the complaint. In March 2023, ABATE and the other intervenor filed a claim of appeal of the Eastern District Court s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Oral arguments occurred in December 2023. 
 Hydroelectric Facilities: In February 2024, Consumers issued a request for proposals to explore the possibility of selling its 13 river hydroelectric dams located throughout Michigan. Consumers has solicited community feedback on the dams futures, as federal operating licenses for the dams begin to expire in 2034. Consumers continues to evaluate each dam s future, options for which include, but are not limited to, renewing operating licenses, transferring ownership, or removing the facilities. 
 Electric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers electric utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1, Regulatory Matters and Note 2, Contingencies and Commitments. 
 MPSC Distribution System Audit: In 2022, the MPSC ordered the state s two largest electric utilities, including Consumers, to report on their compliance with regulations and past MPSC orders governing the utilities response to outages and downed lines. Consumers responded to the MPSC s order as directed. 
 Additionally, as directed by the MPSC, the MPSC Staff engaged a third party auditor to review all equipment and operations of the two utilities distribution systems. In September 2024, the MPSC Staff released the third-party auditor s final report on its audit of Consumers distribution system. The report included several recommendations to improve Consumers distribution system and associated processes and procedures. Consumers is required to file a response to the audit report in November 2024. Consumers is committed to working with the MPSC to continue improving electric reliability and safety in Michigan. 
 
 2024 Electric Rate Case: In May 2024, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of 325 million, made up of two components. First, Consumers requested a 303 million annual rate increase, based on a 10.25 percent authorized return on equity for the projected 12 month period ending February 28, 2026. The filing requested authority to recover costs related to new infrastructure investment primarily in distribution system reliability and cleaner energy resources. Second, Consumers requested approval of a 22 million surcharge for the recovery of distribution investments made in 2023 that exceeded the rates authorized in accordance with previous electric rate orders. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 In October 2024, Consumers revised its requested increase to 277 million, primarily to reflect the removal of projected capital investments associated with certain solar facilities that Consumers plans to incorporate into its amended renewable energy plan. Presented in the following table are the components of the revised requested increase in revenue: 
 In Millions Projected 12-Month Period Ending February 28 2026 Components of the requested rate increase Investment in rate base 144 Operating and maintenance costs 10 Sales and other revenue 41 Cost of capital 60 Subtotal 255 Surcharge 22 Total 277 
 
 Retention Incentive Program: Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers will retire the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. In order to ensure necessary staffing at J.H. Campbell through retirement, Consumers has implemented a retention incentive program. The aggregate cost of the J.H. Campbell program through 2025 is estimated to be 50 million; Consumers expects to recognize 10 million of retention benefit costs in 2024. The MPSC has approved deferred accounting treatment for these costs; these expenses are deferred as a regulatory asset. For additional details on this program, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12, Exit Activities. 
 
 Electric Environmental Outlook: Consumers electric operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of 240 million from 2024 through 2028 to continue to comply with RCRA, the Clean Air Act, and numerous other environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. 
 Air Quality: Multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers electric utility. 
 MATS, emission standards for electric generating units published by the EPA based on Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, continue to apply to Consumers. The company has complied, and continues to comply, with the MATS regulation and does not expect MATS to materially impact its environmental strategy. 
 CSAPR requires Michigan and many other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA modeling, contribute to ground-level ozone in other downwind states. Since its 2015 effective date, CSAPR has been revised several times. In June 2023, the EPA published the Good Neighbor Plan, a revision to CSAPR. This regulation tightens allowance budgets for electric generating units in Michigan between 2023 and 2029 and changes the mechanism for allocating such allowances on a year-over-year basis beginning in 2026. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Good Neighbor Plan pending judicial review and, as a result, the allowance requirements for Michigan are expected to revert back to the prior effective CSAPR rule. Regardless of the outcome of this litigation and which version of the rule applies, Consumers expects this regulation will have minimal financial and operational impact in the near and/or long term.

 In 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify power plants and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. As of May 2023, three counties in western Michigan have been designated as not meeting the ozone standard. None of Consumers fossil-fuel-fired generating units are located in these areas. 
 Additionally, in March 2024, the EPA published a lower fine particulate matter NAAQS, which will likely result in newly designated nonattainment areas in Michigan starting in 2026. Consumers does not expect this rule to have significant impacts on its fossil-fuel-fired generating assets or its clean energy strategy. Consumers will continue to monitor NAAQS rulemakings and litigation to evaluate potential impacts to its generating assets. 
 Consumers continues to evaluate these rules in conjunction with other EPA and EGLE rulemakings, litigation, executive orders, treaties, and congressional actions. This evaluation could result in: 
 a change in Consumers fuel mix 
 changes in the types of generating units Consumers may purchase or build in the future 
 changes in how certain units are operated, including the installation of additional emission control equipment 
 the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of Consumers generating units 
 changes in Consumers environmental compliance costs 
 the purchase or sale of allowances 
 Greenhouse Gases: There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, national, and international levels that involve the potential regulation and reporting of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives, as appropriate. 
 In April 2024, the EPA finalized its rule under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to address greenhouse gas emissions from new combustion turbine electric generating units and existing coal-, gas-, and oil-fueled steam electric generating units. Notably, these rules do not address existing combustion turbine electric generating units, though the EPA has announced that it will release a draft rule for these types of units at a later time. Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal in owned generation in 2025 and does not expect this rule will have a significant impact on its gas- and oil-fueled steam electric generating assets or its Clean Energy Plan. Future EPA regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from existing combustion turbine electric generating units may apply to Consumers gas-fueled combustion turbine facilities and may have a material financial and operational impact. Consumers will continue to follow the EPA rules that address greenhouse gas emissions and will continue to evaluate potential impacts to its operations. 
 Under the Paris Agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers plans to reduce carbon emissions from its electric business by 60 percent from 2005 levels in 2025. At this time, Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of this event, as its plans exceed the nationally committed reduction. The commitment made by the U.S. is not binding without new Congressional legislation. 
 In 2020, Michigan s Governor signed an executive order creating the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which outlines goals for Michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be carbon neutral by 2050. The executive order aims for a 28 percent reduction below 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Consumers has already surpassed the 28 percent reduction milestone for its owned electric generation and previously announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 from its electric business by 2040. The 2023 Energy Law codifies much of the Governor s goals. For additional details on the 2023 Energy Law, see the Planet section of the Executive Overview. 
 Increased frequency or intensity of severe or extreme weather events, including those due to climate change, could materially impact Consumers facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. Consumers is unable to predict these events; however, Consumers evaluates the potential physical impacts of climate change on its operations, including increased frequency or intensity of storm activity; increased precipitation; increased temperature; and changes in lake and river levels. Consumers released a report addressing the physical risks of climate change on its infrastructure in 2022. Consumers is taking steps to mitigate these risks as appropriate. 
 While Consumers cannot predict the outcome of changes in U.S. policy or of other legislative, executive, or regulatory initiatives involving the potential regulation or reporting of greenhouse gases, it intends to move forward with its Clean Energy Plan, its present net-zero goals, and its emphasis on reliable and resilient electric supply. Litigation, international treaties, executive orders, federal laws and regulations (including regulations by the EPA), and state laws and regulations, if enacted or ratified, could ultimately impact Consumers. Consumers may be required to: 
 replace equipment 
 install additional emission control equipment 
 purchase emission allowances or credits (including potential greenhouse gas offset credits) 
 curtail operations 
 arrange for alternative sources of supply 
 purchase or build facilities that generate fewer emissions 
 mothball, sell, or retire facilities that generate certain emissions 
 pursue energy efficiency or demand response measures more swiftly 
 take other steps to manage, sequester, or lower the emission of greenhouse gases 
 Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations. 
 CCRs: In 2015, the EPA published a rule regulating CCRs under RCRA. This rule adopts minimum standards for the disposal of non hazardous CCRs in CCR landfills and surface impoundments and criteria for the beneficial use of CCRs. The rule also sets out conditions under which some CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR wastewater and initiate closure. Due to continued litigation, many aspects of the rule have been remanded to the EPA, resulting in more proposed and final rules. 
 In May 2024, the EPA finalized a rule regulating legacy CCR surface impoundments and CCR management units in response to litigation that exempted inactive impoundments at inactive facilities from the 2015 CCR rule. The new rule adopts minimum standards for impoundments at electric power generation facilities that became inactive before the 2015 CCR rule s effective date. Owners and operators must first assess if an inactive facility contains a legacy surface impoundment before proceeding with the compliance schedule for each of the new requirements. Additionally, the EPA established groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure care requirements for CCR surface impoundments and landfills closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 CCR rule, including CCR landfills that were previously exempted from regulation but are now defined within a broader class of CCR units called CCR management units. Owners are required to identify and assess active facilities and any inactive facilities with at least one legacy impoundment to determine an appropriate course of action (closure, groundwater treatment, etc.) and perform compliance requirements set forth in the compliance schedules under the rules.

 Separately, Congress passed legislation in 2016 allowing participating states to develop permitting programs for CCRs under RCRA Subtitle D. The EPA was granted authority to review these permitting programs to determine if permits issued under the proposed program would be as protective as the federal rule. Once approved, permits issued from an authorized state would replace the requirement to certify compliance with each aspect of the 2015 CCR rule. In 2020, EGLE submitted a regulatory package for Michigan s permit program to the EPA for its review, which is still pending. 
 Consumers, with agreement from EGLE, completed the work necessary to initiate closure by excavating CCRs or placing a final cover over each of its relevant CCR units prior to the closure initiation deadline set forth in the 2015 CCR rule. Consumers has historically been authorized to recover in electric rates costs related to coal ash disposal sites. Consumers is evaluating the new CCR rule, its impact on the state permit program, and performing the required applicability determinations in order to assess the overall impacts of the rule and appropriate next steps. For additional details, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Contingencies and Commitments Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies Electric Environmental Matters. 
 Water: Multiple water-related regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers. 
 The EPA regulates cooling water intake systems of existing electric generating plants under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The rules seek to reduce alleged harmful impacts on aquatic organisms, such as fish. In 2018, Consumers submitted to EGLE studies and recommended plans to comply with Section 316(b) for its coal-fueled units but has not yet received final approval. 
 The EPA also regulates the discharge of wastewater through its effluent limitation guidelines for steam electric generating plants. In 2020, the EPA revised previous guidelines related to the discharge of certain wastewater, but allowed for extension of the compliance deadline from the end of 2023 to the end of 2025, upon approval by EGLE through the NPDES permitting process. Consumers received such an extension for its J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units, which it plans to retire in 2025. In April 2024, the EPA released a final rule updating its effluent limitation guidelines for existing coal-fueled units. This rule regulates additional wastewater streams previously not regulated, including combustion residual leachate and legacy wastewater. Consumers is evaluating these new portions of the rule for their potential impacts on its coal-fueled generating facilities and the associated storage of CCRs. 
 In recent years, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have proposed changes to the scope of federal jurisdiction over bodies of water and to the frequency of dual jurisdiction in states with authority to regulate the same waters; Michigan is one such state. A 2022 rule changed the definition of Waters of the United States, which defines the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. Additionally, in May 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision reducing the scope of Waters of the United States. Consumers does not expect adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the current interpretations and court decision. 
 Many of Consumers facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are vital to the facilities operations. Consumers applies for renewal of these permits every five years. Failure of EGLE to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of NPDES permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility. 
 Protected Wildlife: Multiple regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers relating to protected species and habitats. 
 Statutes like the federal Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 may impact operations at Consumers facilities. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Wildlife Service announced its intent to regulate incidental take under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act but has not yet published a proposed rule. In February 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final rule, effective April 2024, providing for bald eagle general permits for qualifying wind farms and electric distribution systems. While any resulting permitting and monitoring fees and/or restrictions on operations could impact Consumers existing and future operations, Consumers does not expect any material changes to its environmental strategy or Clean Energy Plan as a result of this rule. 
 Additionally, Consumers is monitoring proposed changes to the listing status of several species within its operational area due to an increase in wildlife-related regulatory activity at federal and state levels. A change in species listed under the Endangered Species Act may impact Consumers costs to mitigate its impact on protected species and habitats at certain existing facilities as well as siting choices for new facilities. 
 Other Matters: Other electric environmental matters could have a material impact on Consumers outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Contingencies and Commitments Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies Electric Environmental Matters. 
 
 Consumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties 
 Gas Deliveries: Consumers gas customer deliveries are seasonal. The peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. 
 Over the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized gas deliveries to remain stable relative to 2023. This outlook reflects modest growth in gas demand, offset by the effects of energy waste reduction programs. Actual delivery levels will depend on: 
 weather fluctuations 
 use by power producers 
 availability and development of renewable energy sources 
 gas price changes 
 Michigan s economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity 
 the price or demand of competing energy sources or fuels 
 energy efficiency and conservation impacts 
 Gas Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers gas utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1, Regulatory Matters and Note 2, Contingencies and Commitments. 
 
 2023 Gas Rate Case: In December 2023, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of 136 million based on a 10.25 percent authorized return on equity for the projected test year comprising the 12 month period ending September 30, 2025. In May 2024, Consumers revised its requested increase to 113 million. The filing requested authority to recover new infrastructure investment and related costs that are expected to allow Consumers to continue to provide safe, reliable, affordable, and increasingly cleaner natural gas service. 
 In July 2024, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of 35 million, based on a 9.9 percent authorized return on equity. Additionally, the settlement approves the use of 27.5 million, or one-fourth, of the gain on the sale of Consumers unregulated ASP business as an offset to the revenue deficiency in lieu of additional rate relief during the test year. This results in effective rate relief of 62.5 million for the test year. 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 The settlement agreement also provides for the remaining three-fourths of the 110 million gain on the sale of the ASP business, or 82.5 million, to be provided to customers as a bill credit over a three-year period. The new rates, including the bill credit, became effective October 1, 2024. The settlement also authorizes the continuation of the cost deferral mechanism allowing Consumers to defer for future recovery or refund pension and OPEB expense above or below the amounts used to set rates. For additional details on Consumers sale of its ASP business, see Note 12, Exit Activities. 
 
 Gas Pipeline and Storage Integrity and Safety: The U.S. Department of Transportation s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has published various rules that expand federal safety standards for gas transmission pipelines and underground storage facilities. Initial expanded requirements for transmission pipelines took effect in 2020, with additional requirements released in 2023. There are also proposed rules expanding requirements for gas distribution systems and leak detection and repair. To comply with these rules, Consumers will incur increased capital and operating and maintenance costs to install and remediate pipelines and to expand inspections, maintenance, and monitoring of its existing pipelines and storage facilities. 
 Although associated capital or operating and maintenance costs relating to these regulations could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover such costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and regulations. 
 Gas Environmental Outlook: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23 former MGP sites. For additional details, see Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2, Contingencies and Commitments Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies. 
 Consumers gas operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. 
 Air Quality: Multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers gas utility. 
 In 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify natural gas compressor stations and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. As of May 2023, three counties in western Michigan have been designated as not meeting the ozone standard. One of Consumers compressor stations is in an ozone nonattainment area. Consequently, Consumers has initiated plans to retrofit equipment at this compressor station to lower NOx emissions and comply with a rule proposed by the State of Michigan, as required for a source located in a moderate ozone nonattainment area. Consumers will continue to monitor NAAQS rulemakings and evaluate potential impacts to its compressor stations and other applicable natural gas storage and delivery assets. 
 Greenhouse Gases: There is increasing interest at the federal, state, and local levels in potential regulation of greenhouse gases or their sources. In January 2024, the EPA proposed a new fee for emitting certain waste from petroleum and natural gas systems, as directed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The proposed fees could apply to methane emissions from transmission pipeline, compression, or underground storage that exceed annual thresholds; however, initial analysis indicates Consumers would not be subject to fees under its routine operations. This regulation or others, if adopted, may involve requirements to reduce methane emissions from Consumers gas utility operations and carbon dioxide emissions from customer use of natural gas. Consumers will continue to monitor this proposed rule for potential impacts. 
 In 2020, Michigan s Governor signed an executive order creating the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which outlines goals for Michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be carbon neutral by 2050. The executive order aims for a 28 percent reduction below 2005 levels of 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. For additional details on the executive order, see Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Electric Environmental Outlook. 
 Under the Paris Agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. The commitment made by the U.S. is not binding without new Congressional legislation. Consumers continues to monitor these initiatives and comment as appropriate. Consumers cannot predict the impact of any potential future legislation or regulation on its gas utility. 
 Consumers is making voluntary efforts to reduce its gas utility s methane emissions. Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers has set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system by 2030. Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent, from 2012 baseline levels, by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. To date, Consumers has reduced methane emissions by more than 25 percent. 
 In 2022, Consumers also announced a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for its entire natural gas system by 2050. This includes suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. Consumers Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a rolling ten year investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers, outlines ways in which Consumers can make early progress toward these goals in a cost-effective manner, including energy waste reduction, carbon offsets, and renewable natural gas supply. 
 Consumers has already initiated work in these key areas, continuing to expand its energy waste reduction targets, launching a program allowing gas customers to purchase carbon offset credits on a voluntary basis, and announcing plans to begin development of renewable natural gas facilities that will capture methane from manure generated at Michigan-based farms and convert it into renewable natural gas. Consumers is evaluating and monitoring newer technologies to determine their role in achieving Consumers interim and long-term net-zero goals, including hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic methane; carbon capture sequestration systems; and other innovative technologies. 
 
 NorthStar Clean Energy Outlook and Uncertainties 
 CMS Energy s primary focus with respect to its NorthStar Clean Energy businesses is to maximize the value of generating assets, its share of which represents 1,658 MW of capacity, and to pursue opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects. 
 NorthStar Clean Energy s operations may be subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. NorthStar Clean Energy s primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. 
 CSAPR requires Michigan and many other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA modeling, contribute to ground-level ozone in other downwind states. Since its 2015 effective date, CSAPR has been revised several times. In June 2023, the EPA published the Good Neighbor Plan, a revision to CSAPR. This regulation tightens allowance budgets for electric generating units in Michigan between 2023 and 2029 and changes the mechanism for allocating such allowances on a year-over-year basis beginning in 2026. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Good Neighbor Plan pending judicial review and, as a result, the allowance requirements for Michigan are expected to revert back to the prior effective CSAPR rule. Under the June 2023 revision, NorthStar Clean Energy would incur increased costs to purchase allowances or retrofit equipment.

 In April 2024, the EPA finalized its rule under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to address greenhouse gas emissions from new combustion turbine electric generating units and existing coal-, gas-, and oil-fueled steam electric generating units. Notably, these rules do not address existing combustion turbine electric generating units, though the EPA has announced that it will release a draft rule for these types of units at a later time. Due to the anticipated replacement of coal as a fuel at its one remaining coal-fueled steam electric generating facility, these regulations will not apply to NorthStar Clean Energy s facilities. Future EPA regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from existing combustion turbine electric generating units may apply to NorthStar Clean Energy s gas-fueled combustion turbine facilities and may have a material financial and operational impact. NorthStar Clean Energy will continue to follow the EPA rules that address greenhouse gas emissions and will continue to evaluate potential impacts to its operations. 
 Many of NorthStar Clean Energy s facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are vital to the facilities operations. NorthStar Clean Energy applies for renewal of these permits every five years. Failure of EGLE to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of NPDES permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility. 
 Trends, uncertainties, and other matters related to NorthStar Clean Energy that could have a material impact on CMS Energy s consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include: 
 investment in and financial benefits received from renewable energy and energy storage projects 
 changes in energy and capacity prices 
 severe weather events and climate change associated with increasing levels of greenhouse gases 
 changes in commodity prices on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings 
 changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation 
 indemnity obligations assumed in connection with ownership interests in facilities that involve tax equity financing 
 representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMS Energy in connection with sales of assets 
 delays or difficulties in obtaining environmental permits for facilities located in areas associated with environmental justice concerns

 Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CMS Energy and Consumers in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. As a result, CMS Energy and Consumers have condensed or omitted certain information and note disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. CMS Energy and Consumers have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the presentation in the present period. 
 CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures; actual results could differ from these estimates. In management s opinion, the unaudited information contained in this report reflects all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to ensure that CMS Energy s and Consumers financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented are fairly stated. The notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the 2023 Form 10 K. Due to the seasonal nature of CMS Energy s and Consumers operations, the results presented for this interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved for the fiscal year.

 million, based on an authorized return on equity of percent for the projected 12 month period ending February 28, 2025. In September 2023, Consumers revised its requested increase to million. The filing requested authority to recover costs related to new infrastructure investment primarily in distribution system reliability and cleaner energy resources. 
 In March 2024, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual rate increase of million, which is inclusive of a million surcharge for the recovery of select distribution investments made in 2022 that exceeded the rates authorized in accordance with the December 2021 electric rate order. The approved rate increase is based on a percent authorized return on equity. The new rates became effective March 15, 2024. 
 Meter Investigation: In July 2023, the MPSC issued an order initiating an investigation into Consumers handling of malfunctioning meters and meters requiring transition from 3G to 4G, estimated billing, and

 million penalty to the MPSC and committed to return a minimum of million to customers. Independent of this agreement, Consumers has made a claim against the associated vendor, with any proceeds to be used to reimburse some or all of Consumers million commitment and any excess to be returned to customers.

 million for its remaining obligations for environmental remediation. CMS Energy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of percent and an inflation rate of percent on annual operating and maintenance costs. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is million. 
 
 CMS Energy s estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are changes in circumstances or assumptions used in calculating the liability. Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMS Energy cannot predict the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter.

 million and million. At September 30, 2024, Consumers had a recorded liability of million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. 
 Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under CERCLA. CERCLA liability is joint and several. In 2010, Consumers received official notification from the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party for cleanup of PCBs at the Kalamazoo River CERCLA site. The notification claimed that the EPA had reason to believe that Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. In 2011, Consumers received a follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek, which is connected to the Kalamazoo River. All parties asked to participate in the removal action plan, including Consumers, declined to accept liability. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river. 
 Based on its experience, Consumers estimates its share of the total liability for known CERCLA sites to be between million and million. Various factors, including the number and creditworthiness of potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect Consumers share of the total liability. At September 30, 2024, Consumers had a recorded liability of million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable CERCLA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. 
 The timing of payments related to Consumers remediation and other response activities at its CERCLA and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. A change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and CERCLA liability. 
 In May 2024, the EPA finalized a rule regulating CCR impoundments at power generation sites that became inactive prior to the effective date of a rule published in 2015 regulating CCRs under RCRA. Additionally, the EPA established groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure care requirements for CCR surface impoundments and landfills closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 CCR rule, including CCR landfills that were previously exempted from regulation but are now defined within a broader class of CCR units called CCR management units. In response to the new rule, Consumers recorded an immaterial increase to its existing asset retirement obligation and is performing a review of legacy impoundments located at company-owned power generation sites that ceased operation prior to the effective date of the 2015 CCR rule. If needed, Consumers will record an incremental asset retirement obligation for legacy impoundments when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the associated costs can be made; any resulting asset retirement obligation could be material. Consumers has historically been authorized to recover in electric rates costs related to coal ash disposal sites.

 million in damages related to payments allegedly owed under the parties contract. As a co-owner of Ludington, Consumers would be liable for percent of any such damages, if liability and damages were proven. The court denied the motion to dismiss filed by TAES and Toshiba. The parties are engaged in ongoing litigation, including discovery, pursuant to a court-ordered schedule. Consumers believes the counterclaims filed by TAES and Toshiba are without merit, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy s and Consumers financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 In 2023, Toshiba announced that TBJH became the majority shareholder and new parent company of Toshiba through a common stock purchase. TBJH is a subsidiary of a Japanese private equity firm. Consumers and DTE Electric continue to monitor this development, but do not believe that this affects their rights under the parent guaranty provided by Toshiba. 
 In May 2023, the MPSC approved Consumers and DTE Electric s jointly-filed request for authority to defer as a regulatory asset the costs associated with repairing or replacing the defective work performed by TAES while the litigation with TAES and Toshiba moves forward. Although discovery in the litigation is ongoing, Consumers currently estimates that its share of repair, replacement, and other damages resulting from TAES defective work is approximately million, which may be offset in part or entirely by any potential future litigation proceeds received from TAES or Toshiba. Consumers and DTE Electric will have the opportunity to seek appropriate recovery and ratemaking treatment for amounts recorded as a regulatory asset following resolution of the litigation, including any amounts not recovered from TAES or Toshiba, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of such proceedings. 
 J.H. Campbell 3 Contract Dispute: In 2022, Consumers filed a complaint against Wolverine Power in the Ottawa County Circuit Court and requested a ruling that Consumers has sole authority to decide to retire the J.H. Campbell 3 coal-fueled generating unit under Consumers and Wolverine Power s agreement to jointly own and operate the unit. Wolverine Power filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and a counterclaim seeking approximately million in damages allegedly caused by Consumers decision to retire the unit before the end of its useful life. The state circuit court judge found that Consumers may, in its sole discretion, retire J.H. Campbell 3, provided that Consumers continues to operate and make necessary improvements to the unit while the litigation concerning Wolverine Power s claim for damages is pending. In May 2023, the circuit court judge issued an order granting Consumers motion for clarification confirming that Consumers may continue to operate and invest in J.H. Campbell 3 consistent with the May 2025 retirement date. 
 In March 2024, the circuit court judge issued an order denying Wolverine Power s motion for partial summary disposition and granting in part and denying in part Consumers motion for summary disposition. The judge granted Consumers motion for summary disposition on Wolverine Power s claim

 former MGP facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites, Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a portion of the original site. 
 At September 30, 2024, Consumers had a of million for its remaining obligations for these sites. 
 
 Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability. 
 Pursuant to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers over a period. At September 30, 2024, Consumers had a regulatory asset of million related to the MGP sites.

 1 These obligations arose from the sale of membership interests in Aviator Wind, Newport Solar Holdings, and NWO Holdco to tax equity investors. NorthStar Clean Energy provided certain indemnity obligations that protect the tax equity investors against losses incurred as a result of breaches of representations and warranties under the associated limited liability company agreements. These obligations are generally capped at an amount equal to the tax equity investor s capital contributions plus a specified return, less any distributions and tax benefits it receives, in connection with its membership interest. For any indemnity obligations related to Aviator Wind, NorthStar Clean Energy would recover percent of any amounts paid to the tax equity investor from the other owner of Aviator Wind Equity Holdings. Additionally, Aviator Wind holds insurance coverage that would partially protect against losses incurred as a result of certain failures to qualify for production tax credits. For further details on NorthStar Clean Energy s ownership interest in Aviator Wind, Newport Solar Holdings, and NWO Holdco, see Note 11, Variable Interest Entities. 
 2 These obligations arose from stock and asset sale agreements under which CMS Energy or a subsidiary of CMS Energy indemnified the purchaser for losses resulting from various matters, including claims related to taxes. The maximum obligation amount is mostly related to an Equatorial Guinea tax claim. 
 3 This obligation comprises a guarantee provided by Consumers to the U.S. Department of Energy in connection with a settlement agreement regarding damages resulting from the department s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants formerly owned by Consumers. 
 Additionally, in the normal course of business, CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMS Energy have entered into various agreements containing tax and other indemnity provisions for which they are unable to estimate the maximum potential obligation. CMS Energy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to these indemnities and those disclosed in the table to be remote.

 Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at September 30, 2024, Consumers had billion of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that, under a variety of circumstances, dividends from Consumers on its common stock would not be limited to amounts in Consumers retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay dividends on its common stock in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would be subject to a formal regulatory filing process. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Consumers paid million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy.

Under the associated limited liability company agreement, the tax equity investor is guaranteed preferred returns from the entity . 
 Earnings, tax attributes, and cash flows generated by the entities in which NorthStar Clean Energy holds a Class B membership are allocated among and distributed to the membership classes in accordance with the ratios specified in the associated limited liability company agreements; these ratios change over time and are not representative of the ownership interest percentages of each membership class. Since these entities income and cash flows are not distributed among their investors based on ownership interest percentages, NorthStar Clean Energy allocates the entities income (loss) among the investors by applying the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. This method calculates each investor s earnings based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entities at the net book value of underlying assets as of the balance sheet date. The liquidation tax gain (loss) is allocated to each investor s capital account, resulting in income (loss) equal to the period change in the investor s capital account balance.

 Sale of ASP Business: In April 2024, Consumers sold its unregulated ASP business to a non-affiliated company. Consumers received proceeds of million from the transaction, which resulted in a million gain on the transaction. 
 Prior to the sale closing, Consumers filed an application requesting the MPSC s approval to share voluntarily with customers half of the gain, net of transaction costs, to be recognized on this sale. In Consumers 2023 gas rate case, it had proposed sharing the gain with customers over in the form of a surcharge credit. In July 2024, the MPSC approved a settlement in the gas rate case, under which Consumers agreed to utilize million, or one-fourth, of the gain on the sale as an offset to the revenue deficiency in lieu of additional rate relief, with the remaining three-fourths of the gain, or million, to be credited to customers as a bill credit over a period. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024, Consumers recorded a regulatory liability of million on its consolidated balance sheets.
