 As previously discussed, we provide real estate services such as property management, development and construction services primarily for our properties but also for third parties. The primary manner in which we evaluate the operating performance of our service activities is through a measure we define as net operating income from service operations NOI from service operations ), which is based on the net of revenues and expenses from these activities. Construction contract and other service revenues and expenses consist primarily of subcontracted costs that are reimbursed to us by the customer along with a management fee. The operating margins from these activities are small relative to the revenue. We believe NOI from service operations is a useful measure in assessing both our level of activity and our profitability in conducting such operations.

 The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. In the segment reporting presented above, we did not allocate interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, gain on sales of real estate and equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities not included in NOI to our real estate segments since they are not included in the measure of segment profit reviewed by management. We also did not allocate general, administrative, leasing and other expenses, interest and other income, net, income taxes and noncontrolling interests because these items represent general corporate or non-operating property items not attributable to segments.

 Profit Interest Units in CDPLP PIUs 
 
 We granted forms of PIUs: time-based PIUs TB-PIUs and performance-based PIUs PB-PIUs ). TB-PIUs are subject to forfeiture restrictions until the end of the requisite service period, at which time the TB-PIUs automatically convert into vested PIUs. PB-PIUs are subject to a market condition in that the number of earned awards are determined at the end of the performance period (as described further below) and then settled in vested PIUs. Vested PIUs automatically convert into common units in CDPLP if, or when, a book-up event (as defined under federal income tax regulations) has occurred and carry substantially the same rights to distributions as common units.

 On January 1, 2024, we granted certain senior management team members PB-PIUs with a performance period concluding on the earlier of December 31, 2026 or the date of: (1) termination by us without cause, death or disability of the employee or constructive discharge of the employee (collectively, qualified termination or (2) a sale event.

If the percentile rank exceeds the 25th percentile and is between of the percentile ranks set forth in the table above, then the percentage of the earned awards will be interpolated between the ranges set forth in the table above to reflect any performance between the listed percentiles. If COPT s TSR is negative when its TSR s percentile rank exceeds the 50th percentile, then the earned PB-PIU payout percentage used to arrive at the earned awards would be reduced by percentage points, but in no event to a payout percentage of less than of PB-PIUs granted; however, the resulting reduction in earned awards would subsequently be deemed earned awards if COPT Defense s TSR becomes positive on any date in the calendar year following the end of the performance period. In addition, regardless of COPT Defense s TSR relative to the peer group, no less than (target) of the PB-PIUs granted will be earned if COPT Defense s TSR is at least 10 and no less than of the PB-PIUs granted will be earned if COPT Defense s TSR is at least 6 , with linear interpolation if COPT Defense s TSR is between 6 and 10 . 
 
 During the performance period, PB-PIUs carry rights to distributions equal to of the distribution rights of common units but carry no redemption rights. 
 
 Following the end of the performance period, we will settle the award by issuing vested PIUs equal to: the number of earned awards; and the excess, if any, of (1) the aggregate distributions that would have been paid with respect to vested PIUs issued in settlement of the earned awards through the date of settlement had such vested PIUs been issued on the grant date over (2) the aggregate distributions made on the PB-PIUs through the date of settlement, divided by the price of our common shares over a defined period of time. If a performance period ends due to a sale event or qualified termination, the number of earned awards is prorated based on the portion of the performance period that has elapsed. If employment is terminated by the employee or by us for cause, all PB-PIUs are forfeited. 
 
 These PB-PIU grants had an aggregate grant date fair value of million per target-level award associated with the grants) that is being recognized over the performance period. The grant date fair value was computed using a Monte Carlo model that included the following assumptions: baseline common share value of ; expected volatility for common shares of ; and a risk-free interest rate of . 
 
 Based on COPT Defense s TSR relative to its peer group of companies, for the 2021 PB-PIUs issued to executives that vested on December 31, 2023, we issued PIUs in settlement of the PB-PIUs on February 1, 2024.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-employee Trustees were granted deferred share awards with an aggregate grant date fair value of per award). Deferred share awards vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided that the Trustee remains in his or her position.

 million for certain municipal tax claims; while we do not believe this loss would materially affect our financial position or liquidity, it could be material to our results of operations. Management believes that it is also reasonably possible that we could incur losses pursuant to other claims but do not believe such losses would materially affect our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Our assessment of the potential outcomes of these matters involves significant judgment and is subject to change based on future developments. 
 
 Environmental 
 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental regulations related to our property ownership and operations. We have performed environmental assessments of our properties, the results of which have not revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, operations or liquidity. 
 
 In connection with a lease and subsequent sale in 2008 and 2010 of properties in Dayton, New Jersey, we agreed to provide certain environmental indemnifications limited to million in the aggregate. We have insurance coverage in place to mitigate most of any potential future losses that may result from these indemnification agreements. 
 
 Tax Incremental Financing Obligation 
 
 Anne Arundel County, Maryland issued tax incremental financing bonds to third-party investors in order to finance public improvements needed in connection with our project known as the National Business Park. These bonds had a remaining principal balance of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. The real estate taxes on increases in assessed values post-bond issuance of properties in development districts encompassing the National Business Park are transferred to a special fund pledged to the repayment of the bonds. While we are obligated to fund, through a special tax, any future shortfalls between debt service of the bonds and real estate taxes available to repay the bonds, as of September 30, 2024, we do not expect any such future fundings will be required.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we: 
 
 > finished the period with our portfolio 93.1 occupied and 94.8 leased; 
 > achieved a tenant retention rate of 84.3 , which was driven by strong leasing demand for space in our Defense/IT Portfolio; and 
 > expanded our Defense/IT Portfolio by acquiring: 
 > 6841 Benjamin Franklin Drive, a 202,000 square foot property in Columbia, Maryland that was 56 leased, for a purchase price of 15.0 million on March 15, 2024; 
 > 3900 Rogers Road, an 80,000 square foot property in San Antonio, Texas that was vacant on the acquisition date and subsequently leased in full, for a purchase price of 17.0 million on September 26, 2024; and 
 > 365 acres of land near Des Moines, Iowa for 32.0 million on September 27, 2024 that we believe could be developed into approximately 3.3 million square feet of data center shell space. 
 
 We discuss significant factors contributing to changes in our net income or loss in the section below entitled Results of Operations. In addition, the section below entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources includes discussions of, among other things: 
 
 > how we expect to generate and obtain cash for short and long-term capital needs; and 
 > material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations. 
 
 We refer to the measures annualized rental revenue, tenant retention rate, investment space leasing and vacant space leasing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Annualized rental revenue is a measure that we use to evaluate the source of our rental revenue as of a point in time. It is computed by multiplying by 12 the sum of monthly contractual base rents and estimated monthly expense reimbursements under active leases as of a point in time (ignoring free rent then in effect and rent associated with tenant funded landlord assets). Our computation of annualized rental revenue excludes the effect of lease incentives. We consider annualized rental revenue to be a useful measure for analyzing revenue sources because, since it is point-in-time based, it does not contain increases and decreases in revenue associated with periods in which lease terms were not in effect; historical revenue under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP does contain such fluctuations. We find the measure particularly useful for leasing, tenant, segment and industry analysis. Tenant retention rate is a measure we use that represents the percentage of square feet renewed in a period relative to the total square feet scheduled to expire in that period; we include the effect of early renewals in this measure. Investment space leasing represents vacant space leased within two years of the shell completion date for development properties or the acquisition date for operating property acquisitions. Vacant space leasing represents our vacated second-generation space leased and vacant space leased in development properties and operating property acquisitions after two years from such properties shell completion or acquisition date. 
 
 For operating portfolio square footage, occupancy and leasing statistics included below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, amounts disclosed include information pertaining to properties owned through unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. 
 
 You should refer to our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as you read this section. 
 
 This section contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition and operations of our business. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as may, will, should, could, believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, plan or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which we cannot predict with accuracy and some of which we might not even anticipate. Although we believe that the expectations, estimates and projections reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that these expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Future events and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements reflect our opinion only as of the date on which they were made. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

 > adverse changes in the real estate markets, including, among other things, increased competition with other companies; 
 > our ability to borrow on favorable terms; 
 28 

> risks of property acquisition and development activities, including, among other things, risks that development projects may not be completed on schedule, that tenants may not take occupancy or pay rent or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated; 
 > risks of investing through joint venture structures, including risks that our joint venture partners may not fulfill their financial obligations as investors or may take actions that are inconsistent with our objectives; 
 > changes in our plans for properties or views of market economic conditions or failure to obtain development rights, either of which could result in recognition of significant impairment losses; 
 > potential impact of prolonged government shutdowns or budgetary reductions or impasses, such as a reduction of rental revenues, non-renewal of leases and/or reduced or delayed demand for additional space by existing or new tenants; 
 > potential additional costs, such as capital improvements, fees and penalties, associated with environmental laws or regulations; 
 > adverse changes resulting from other government actions and initiatives, such as changes in taxation, zoning laws or other regulations; 
 > our ability to satisfy and operate effectively under federal income tax rules relating to real estate investment trusts and partnerships; 
 > the dilutive effects of issuing additional common shares; and 
 > security breaches relating to cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or other factors, and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems.

Results of Operations 
 
 We evaluate the operating performance of our properties using NOI from real estate operations, our segment performance measure, which includes: real estate revenues and property operating expenses; and the net of revenues and property operating expenses of real estate operations owned through unconsolidated real estate joint ventures UJV or UJVs that is allocable to our ownership interest UJV NOI allocable to COPT Defense ). The table below reconciles net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NOI from real estate operations: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net income (loss) 37,397 (221,207) 107,475 (109,167) Construction contract and other service revenues (16,662) (11,949) (63,523) (42,012) Depreciation and other amortization associated with real estate operations 38,307 37,620 114,819 112,215 Construction contract and other service expenses 16,127 11,493 61,746 40,249 Impairment losses 252,797 252,797 General, administrative, leasing and other expenses 11,416 10,576 35,195 31,424 Interest expense 20,376 17,798 61,760 50,759 Interest and other income, net (3,324) (2,529) (10,330) (6,928) Gain on sales of real estate (49,392) Equity in (income) loss of unconsolidated entities (85) 68 (180) 21 UJV NOI allocable to COPT Defense included in equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities 1,844 1,675 5,319 4,988 Income tax expense 130 152 312 467 NOI from real estate operations 105,526 96,494 312,593 285,421 
 
 We view our changes in NOI from real estate operations as being comprised of the following primary categories: 
 
 > Same Property, which we define as properties stably owned and 100 operational throughout the current and prior year reporting periods being compared; 
 > developed properties placed into service that were not 100 operational throughout the current and prior year reporting periods being compared; 
 > acquired properties; and 
 > disposed properties. 
 
 Our Same Property pool consisted of 189 properties, comprising 91.4 of our portfolio s square footage as of September 30, 2024. This pool of properties changed from the pool used for purposes of comparing 2023 and 2022 in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K due to the addition of seven properties placed in service and 100 operational on or before January 1, 2023 and two properties owned through a UJV that was formed in 2022. 
 
 In addition to owning properties, we provide construction management and other services. The primary manner in which we evaluate the operating performance of our construction management and other service activities is through a measure we define as NOI from service operations, which is based on the net of the revenues and expenses from these activities. The revenues and expenses from these activities consist primarily of subcontracted costs that are reimbursed to us by customers along with a management fee. The operating margins from these activities are small relative to the revenue. We believe NOI from service operations is a useful measure in assessing both our level of activity and our profitability in conducting such operations. 
 
 Since both of the measures discussed above exclude certain items includable in net income or loss, reliance on these measures has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are considered alongside other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of NOI from real estate operations and NOI from service operations to net income (loss) reported on the consolidated statements of operations is provided in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

Regarding the changes in NOI from real estate operations reported above: 
 
 > the increase for our Same Property pool was due in large part to additional revenue in the current period resulting from increased rental and occupancy rates; 
 > developed properties placed in service reflects the effect of eight properties placed in service in 2023 and 2024; 
 > acquired properties includes two operating office properties acquired in 2024; and 
 > dispositions, net of retained interest in newly-formed UJVs reflects the effect of our sale of 90 of our interests in three data center shells in 2023. 
 
 NOI from Service Operations 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance (in thousands) Construction contract and other service revenues 16,662 11,949 4,713 Construction contract and other service expenses (16,127) (11,493) (4,634) NOI from service operations 535 456 79 
 
 Construction contract and other service revenues and expenses increased in the current period due to a higher volume of construction activity for one of our tenants. Construction contract activity is inherently subject to significant variability depending on the volume and nature of projects undertaken by us primarily on behalf of tenants. Service operations are an ancillary component of our overall operations that typically contribute an insignificant amount of income relative to our real estate operations. 
 
 Impairment Losses 
 
 As part of our closing process for the three months ended September 30, 2023, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio of long-lived assets to be held and used for indicators of impairment. As a result of this process, we shortened the expected holding periods for six operating properties in our Other segment and a parcel of land located in Baltimore, Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. We determined that the carrying amount of the properties would not likely be recovered from the undiscounted cash flows from the operations and sales of the properties over the shortened holding periods. Accordingly, we recognized impairment losses of 252.8 million on these properties during the period. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense increased due primarily to additional interest associated with our 5.25 Notes that we issued in September 2023.

 Interest and other income, net increased due primarily to interest income earned from a portion of the net proceeds from the 5.25 Notes issuance being invested in short-term interest-bearing money market accounts.

 Funds from Operations 
 
 Funds from operations FFO is defined as net income or loss computed using GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairment losses of real estate and investments in UJVs (net of associated income tax) and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO also includes adjustments to net income or loss for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe that we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit definition of FFO, although others may interpret the definition differently and, accordingly, our presentation of FFO may differ from those of other REITs. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains on sales and impairment losses of real estate (net of associated income tax), and real estate-related depreciation and amortization, FFO can help one compare our operating performance between periods. In addition, since most equity REITs provide FFO information to the investment community, we believe that FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental measure for comparing our results to those of other equity REITs. We believe that net income or loss is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO. 
 
 Since FFO excludes certain items includable in net income or loss, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. FFO is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income or loss when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service. 
 
 Basic FFO available to common share and common unit holders Basic FFO is FFO adjusted to subtract (1) preferred share dividends, (2) income attributable to noncontrolling interests through ownership of preferred units in the Operating Partnership or interests in other consolidated entities not owned by us, (3) depreciation and amortization allocable to noncontrolling interests in other consolidated entities and (4) Basic FFO allocable to share-based compensation awards. With these adjustments, Basic FFO represents FFO available to common shareholders and common unitholders. Common units in the Operating Partnership are substantially similar to our common shares and are exchangeable into common shares, subject to certain conditions. We believe that Basic FFO is useful to investors due to the close correlation of common units to common shares. We believe that net income or loss is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Basic FFO. Basic FFO has 
 36 

essentially the same limitations as FFO; management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for FFO. 
 
 Diluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders Diluted FFO is Basic FFO adjusted to add back any changes in Basic FFO that would result from the assumed conversion of securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares. We believe that Diluted FFO is useful to investors because it is the numerator used to compute Diluted FFO per share, discussed below. We believe that net income or loss is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO. Since Diluted FFO excludes certain items includable in the numerator to diluted EPS, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in the balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Diluted FFO (which includes discontinued operations) is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income or loss when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service. 
 
 Diluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders, as adjusted for comparability is defined as Diluted FFO adjusted to exclude: operating property acquisition costs (for acquisitions classified as business combinations); gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt; FFO associated with properties that secured non-recourse debt on which we defaulted and, subsequently, extinguished, via conveyance of such properties (including property NOI, interest expense and gains on debt extinguishment); loss on interest rate derivatives; and executive transition costs associated with named executive officers. This measure also includes adjustments for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. We believe that net income or loss is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this non-GAAP measure. This measure has essentially the same limitations as Diluted FFO, as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO. 
 
 Diluted FFO per share is (1) Diluted FFO divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that Diluted FFO per share is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results in the same manner that investors use earnings per share EPS in evaluating net income or loss available to common shareholders. In addition, since most equity REITs provide Diluted FFO per share information to the investment community, we believe that Diluted FFO per share is a useful supplemental measure for comparing us to other equity REITs. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO per share. Diluted FFO per share has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above); management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO. 
 
 Diluted FFO per share, as adjusted for comparability is (1) Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO per share as it excludes gains and losses from investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this per share measure. This measure has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above) as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO. 
 
 The computations for all of the above measures on a diluted basis assume the conversion of common units in CDPLP but do not assume the conversion of other securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase per share measures in a given period.

The table below sets forth the computation of the above stated measures, and provides reconciliations from the GAAP measures associated with such measures:

Property Additions 
 
 The table below sets forth the major components of our additions to properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Development 123,867 Tenant improvements on operating properties (1) 37,478 Capital improvements on operating properties 17,352 Acquisition of operating properties (2) 24,996 203,693 
 (1) Tenant improvement costs incurred on newly-developed properties are classified in this table as development. 
 (2) Excludes intangible assets associated with the acquisition. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Net cash flow from operating activities increased 20.2 million when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due primarily to the effects of increased cash flow from real estate operations resulting from the growth of our operating portfolio, which was partially offset by higher cash paid for interest expense due in large part to our 5.25 Notes issued in September 2023. 
 
 Net cash flow used in investing activities increased 127.3 million when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due primarily to proceeds from properties sold in the prior period (which included our sale of a 90 interest in three data center shells), which was partially offset by decreased cash paid for properties in development or held for future development. 
 
 Net cash flow used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 134.5 million, and included primarily the following: 
 
 > repayments of debt borrowings during the period of 29.5 million; and 
 > dividends to common shareholders of 98.6 million. 
 
 Net cash flow provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 81.0 million, and included primarily the following: 
 
 > net proceeds of debt borrowings during the period of 182.2 million, which included the net effect of our issuance of the 5.25 Notes and a net paydown of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility using proceeds from the notes issuance and from property sales; and 
 > dividends to common shareholders of 95.1 million. 
 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, CDPLP had several series of unsecured senior notes outstanding that were issued in transactions registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These notes are CDPLP s direct, senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of CDPLP s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. However, these notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to CDPLP s existing and future secured indebtedness. The notes are also effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, of CDPLP's subsidiaries. COPT Defense fully and unconditionally guarantees CDPLP s obligations under these notes. COPT Defense s guarantees of these notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with other senior unsecured obligations of, or guarantees by, COPT Defense. COPT Defense itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its investment in CDPLP. 
 
 As permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi), we do not provide summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership since: the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company; and we believe that inclusion of such summarized financial information would be repetitive and not provide incremental value to investors. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 34.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 We have a Revolving Credit Facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of 600.0 million. We use this facility to initially fund most of the cash requirements from our investing activities, including property development and acquisition costs, as well as certain debt balloon payments due upon maturity. We then subsequently pay down the facility using cash available from 
 39 

operations and proceeds from financing and/or investing activities, such as long-term borrowings, equity issuances and sales of interests in properties. The facility matures in October 2026 and may be extended by two six-month periods at our option, provided that there is no default under the facility and we pay an extension fee of 0.0625 of the total availability under the facility for each extension period. Our available borrowing capacity under the facility totaled 525.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade, with stable outlooks, by the three major rating agencies. We aim to maintain an investment grade rating to enable us to use debt comprised of unsecured, primarily fixed-rate debt (including the effect of interest rate swaps) from public markets and banks. We also use secured nonrecourse debt from institutional lenders and banks primarily for joint venture financings. In addition, we periodically raise equity when we access the public equity markets by issuing common shares and, to a lesser extent, preferred shares. 
 
 We have a program in place under which we may offer and sell common shares in at-the-market stock offerings having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 300 million. Under this program, we may also, at our discretion, sell common shares under forward equity sales agreements. The use of a forward equity sales agreement would enable us to lock in a price on a sale of common shares when the agreement is executed but defer issuing the shares and receiving the sale proceeds until a later date. 
 
 We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate for our near-term and longer-term requirements without necessitating property sales. However, we may dispose of interests in properties opportunistically or when market conditions otherwise warrant. 
 
 Our material cash requirements, including contractual and other obligations, include: 
 
 > property operating expenses, including future lease obligations from us as a lessee; 
 > construction contract expenses; 
 > general, administrative, leasing and other expenses; 
 > debt service, including interest expense; 
 > property development costs; 
 > tenant and capital improvements and leasing costs for operating properties (expected to total approximately 35 million during the remainder of 2024); 
 > debt balloon payments due upon maturity; and 
 > dividends to our shareholders. 
 
 We expect to use cash flow from operations during the remainder of 2024 and annually thereafter for the foreseeable future to fund all of these cash requirements except for debt balloon payments due upon maturity and a portion of property development costs, the fundings for which are discussed below. 
 
 During the remainder of 2024, we expect to spend 55 million to 65 million on costs for properties actively under development, most of which was contractually obligated as of September 30, 2024, and had no debt balloon payments maturing. In addition, we expect to continue to actively develop additional properties. We expect to fund these costs using, in part, available cash flow from operations and any excess available cash and cash equivalents, with the balance funded using borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, at least initially. 
 
 Beyond 2024, we expect to continue to actively develop properties and also could opportunistically acquire operating properties. We expect to fund these activities using, in part, available cash flow from operations, with the balance funded primarily using borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, at least initially. 
 
 We provide disclosure in our consolidated financial statements on our future lessee obligations (expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations) in Note 5 and future debt obligations (expected to be refinanced by new debt borrowings or funded by future equity issuances and/or sales of interests in properties) in Note 8. 
 
 Certain of our debt instruments require that we comply with a number of restrictive financial covenants, including maximum leverage ratio, unencumbered leverage ratio, minimum net worth, minimum fixed charge coverage, minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, minimum debt service and maximum secured indebtedness ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were compliant with these covenants. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, one of the most predominant of which is a change in interest rates. Increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our Revolving Credit Facility and other variable-rate debt to the extent we do not have interest rate swaps in place to hedge the effect of such rate increases. Increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our fixed-rate debt matures and needs to be refinanced. 
 
 40 

The following table sets forth as of September 30, 2024 our debt obligations and weighted average interest rates on debt maturing each year (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Periods Ending December 31, 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Debt: Fixed rate debt (1) 320 1,302 436,140 345,000 1,400,000 2,182,762 Weighted average interest rate 3.22 3.23 2.38 5.25 2.58 2.96 Variable rate debt (2) 135 22,415 210,160 232,710 Weighted average interest rate (3) 6.85 6.90 6.52 6.56 
 (1) Represents principal maturities only and therefore excludes net discounts and deferred financing costs of 24.6 million. 
 (2) As of September 30, 2024, maturities in 2026 included 75.0 million that may be extended to 2027 and 125.0 million that may be extended to 2028, both subject to certain conditions. 
 (3) The amounts reflected above used interest rates as of September 30, 2024 for variable-rate debt. 
 
 The fair value of our debt was 2.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. If interest rates had been 1 lower, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt would have increased by approximately 77 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to interest rate swap contracts in place as of September 30, 2024 and their respective fair values. 
 
 Based on our variable-rate debt balances, including the effect of interest rate swap contracts, our interest expense would not have changed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 if the applicable variable index rate was 1 higher. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
