FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements, other than statements of historical
facts, contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial
position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, 
 believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, 
 project, target, potential, will, would, could, should, 
 continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements
contain these identifying words. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical
trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you
read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance
or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control), and assumptions. Although we believe that these
forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual operating
and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements.
We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, those described under Risk Factors and Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from
the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements. 

As a result of these and other factors, we may not
actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance
on our forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

on August 16, 2022 in connection with Forza s IPO. Forza also had outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock
issuable at a weighted-average exercise price of per share that were issued to the representative of the underwriters on June 14,
2023 in connection with Forza s secondary offering. The representative s warrants are exercisable at any time and from time
to time, in whole or in part, and expire on August 16, 2027 and June 16, 2028, respectively. There was warrant activity during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Equity Compensation Plan 

Forza maintains an equity
compensation plan under which it may award employees, directors and consultants incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted
stock, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards with terms established by the Compensation Committee of the Forza Board
of Directors which has been appointed by the Forza Board of Directors to administer the Forza 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (the Forza
Plan ). The number of awards under the Forza Plan automatically increased on January 1, 2024 and will automatically increase on
January 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares remaining available for grant under the Forza Plan. Stock
based compensation expense is included in the Statements of Operations, under salaries and wages. 

Accounting for Stock -Based
Compensation 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, Forza recorded and , respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. For the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, Forza recorded and , respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense
is included in salaries and wages on the accompanying condensed statement of operations. 

Stock Options 

Under the Forza Plan, Forza
has issued stock options. A stock option grant gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a certain number of shares

periods. Under the terms of the Forza Plan, the contractual life of the option grants may not exceed ten years. 

Forza utilizes the Black-Scholes
model to determine fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant. Forza utilized the following assumptions for option grants

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

You should read the following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking
Statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. You should
also review the disclosure under the heading Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and
under Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of important factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

OVERVIEW 

We are a designer, manufacturer and marketer of recreational
and commercial power boats. We believe our company has been an innovator in the recreational and commercial power catamaran industry.
We currently have 13 gas-powered models in production ranging in size from our 22-foot mono hull, single engine, center console to our
newly designed 40-foot offshore 400 GFX catamaran, quad engines. While our twin-hull catamaran running surface, known as a symmetrical
catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin Vee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel efficiency, and offering users a stable riding
boat, our new mono hull line addresses the largest portion of the overall market. 

Historically, we have organized our business into three operating segments: (i) our gas-powered
boat segment which manufactures and distributes gas-powered boats under the Twin Vee and AquaSport names; (ii) our electric-powered boat
segment which is developing fully electric boats, through our publicly owned subsidiary, Forza X1, Inc., a Delaware corporation Forza and (iii) our franchise segment which is developing a standard product offering and will be selling franchises across the United States.
Inasmuch as we determined to discontinue and wind down Forza s business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing
its proprietary outboard electric motor, we do not anticipate having an electric boat segment in the future. 

Our gas-powered boats allow consumers to use them
for a wide range of recreational activities including fishing, diving and water skiing and commercial activities including transportation,
eco tours, fishing and diving expeditions. We believe that the performance, quality and value of our boats position us to achieve our
goal of increasing our market share and expanding the power catamaran boating market. We currently primarily sell our boats through a
current network of 23 independent boat dealers in 37 locations across North America and the Caribbean who resell our boats to the end
user Twin Vee and AquaSport customers. We continue recruiting efforts for high quality boat dealers and seek to establish new dealers
and distributors domestically and internationally to distribute our boats as we grow our production and introduce new models. Our gas-powered
boats are currently outfitted with gas-powered outboard combustion engines. 

29 

During the third quarter of 2024, we have continued
to experience a significant reduction in demand for our products, as has been experienced throughout the boating industry. Total units
sold in the quarter were 20 compared to 66 in the third quarter of 2023, a 70 reduction, compared to a 64 reduction in revenue over
the same period. This difference is due to the average selling price per unit in each quarter. Sales per unit for the third quarter of
2024 was approximately 145,065 compared to 122,371 the prior year quarter as the company has focused more on larger boats in the current
year. The Company s objectives have been to add new, larger boat models including a new line of GFX2 models, expand our dealers
and distribution network, and increase unit production to fulfill our customer and dealer orders. 

Due to the growing demand for sustainable, environmentally
friendly electric and alternative fuel commercial and recreational vehicles, Forza, entered the business of designing and developing a
line of electric-powered boats. Our electric boats are being designed as fully integrated electric boats including the hull, outboard
motor and control system. To date, Forza X1 has built-out and tested multiple Forza company units, including: three offshore-style catamarans,
two bay boat-style catamarans, one deck boat and three 22-foot center console (F22) monohulls. The past year has seen a marked deceleration
in the global demand for recreational marine vehicles, influenced heavily by economic uncertainties and shifting consumer priorities.
This slowdown reflects broader trends affecting the recreational vehicle industries at large, including electric vehicles (EVs). Notably,
the global shift towards EV adoption has been much slower than initially anticipated. Several leading automotive manufacturers have adjusted
their strategies, accordingly, including halting the construction of dedicated EV factories. 

The slower-than-expected adoption rates have led to
cautious consumer spending and investment in EV technology, directly impacting the Company s market. Specifically, the electric
boat segment has experienced even more sluggish growth than the automotive sector. In addition, many of the larger players in the boat
industry, such as Mercury Marine, have completed their development efforts and have brought their electric outboard motors to market.
Despite these challenges, we have managed to sustain operations through strategic adjustments, including cost management and a focus on
strategic partnerships. We have implemented measures that have reduced cash burn and conserved cash reserves while seeking to leverage
our technological advancements through strategic collaborations and partnerships to enhance shareholder value. We have responded to the
industry challenges by tightening our financial reins to mitigate the impacts of reduced demand with a view toward long-term sustainability.
In an effort to further retain cash and reduce expenditures and as a result of current market conditions, on July 11, 2024, the Board
of Directors of Forza determined to discontinue and wind down its business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing
its proprietary outboard electric motor. 

Recent Developments 

On July 12, 2024, Karl Zimmer was appointed
as our President. 

On August 12, 2024, we entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Forza and Twin Vee Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and our wholly owned subsidiary Merger Sub ), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Forza will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Forza surviving the merger (the Merger ).
The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of
the Merger (the Effective Time ), each outstanding share of Forza common stock (other than any shares held by us), will be
converted into the right to receive 0.61166627 shares (the Exchange Ratio of our common stock, any fractional shares to
be rounded down to the nearest whole share of common stock, for an aggregate of 5,355,000 shares of our common stock. Each outstanding
stock option exercisable for shares of Forza common stock that is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will
be assumed by us and converted into a stock option to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that the holder would have received
if such holder had exercised such stock option for shares of Forza common stock prior to the Merger and exchanged such shares for our
common stock in accordance with the Exchange Ratio. Each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Forza common stock will be assumed
by us and converted into a warrant to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that the holder would have received if such holder
had exercised such warrant for shares of Forza common stock prior to the Merger and exchanged such shares for shares of our common stock
in accordance with the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment for any reverse stock split. In addition, at the Effective Time the 7,000,000
shares of Forza common stock held by us will be cancelled. 

30 

The completion of the Merger by each of us and Forza is subject to customary
conditions, including (1) (A) adoption of the Merger Agreement by Forza s stockholders (which approval shall include a majority
of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Forza annual meeting excluding shares held by us) and (B) approval by our shareholders
of the issuance of our shares of common stock to the Forza stockholders, (2) authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market of
the shares of our common stock to be issued in the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance, (3) effectiveness of the registration
statement on Form S-4 for our common stock to be issued in the Merger, and (4) the absence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal
restraint preventing the completion of the Merger or making the completion of the Merger illegal. Each party s obligation to complete
the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the other party and performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.
 In our capacity as a principal stockholder of Forza, we have agreed to vote the shares of Forza
common stock held by us for the approval and adoption of the Merger only if a majority of the other stockholders of Forza present in person
or by proxy at the Forza annual meeting vote to approve and adopt the Merger. 

The
 Merger Agreement contains certain
termination rights for both Forza and the Company. In addition, either the Company or Forza may terminate the Merger Agreement if the
Merger is not consummated by December 1, 2024. On November 11, 2024, we held our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual
Meeting ). At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved the issuance of shares of our common stock to Forza stockholders pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement. We believe that all closing conditions will be met and anticipate
consummating the Merger in the near future .

Net Sales and Cost of Sales 

Our net sales decreased by 5,175,227, or 64 to 2,901,318
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8,076,545 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to
a decrease in the number of boats sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the mix of boats sold. The number of boats
sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 70 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profits (losses) decreased by 751,168 or 124 
to (145,657) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 605,511 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit
as a percentage of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was -5.0 and 7.5 respectively. On a sequential basis,
gross profit declined 348,997 while sales declined 1,425,503, reflecting our efforts to reduce our cost structure and limit cash burn
during this economic downturn in the marine industry. We continue to right size the workforce and drive efficiency in all parts of our
cost structure. 

Total Operating Expenses 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, operating expenses were 2,843,573 and 3,384,934, respectively. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 98.0 compared
to 41.9 in the prior year. Operating expenses, for the gas-powered boat segment, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
were 1,990,512 and 2,124,980, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating
expenses for our gas-powered segment were 68.6 and 26.4 , respectively. Our total operating expenses for Forza, our electric powered
boat and development segment, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 852,451 and 1,258,966, respectively. 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased
by approximately 22 , or 220,124 to 764,757 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 984,881 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in marketing, advertising, dealer meeting and travel expenses. 

Salaries and wage related expenses decreased 34 ,
or 586,366 to 1,145,568 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,731,934 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The majority of the decrease is due to reductions in staffing levels at Forza. Included in salaries and wage related expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 was stock-based compensation expense of 278,867, Forza s portion of that expense being
 174,159. In total, stock-based compensation expense decreased by 185,693 or 40 as compared to the prior year period. 

Research and development expenses increased by 25,536
to 89,403 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 63,867 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
due primarily to the charges for an inventory allowance related to R D inventory at Forza, partially offset by lower R D activity. 

Professional fees increased by 51 or 140,961 to
 403,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 262,426 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase
was due primarily to higher legal and consulting expenses in the current year related to exploration of strategic options at Forza and
the Merger between Twin Vee and Forza. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
29 , or 98,632 to 440,458 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 341,826 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. This increase is due to the addition of fixed assets, primarily molds, to increase our production levels and throughout. 

32 

Other income decreased by 356,091 to a loss of 20,677
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 355,414 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was
due primarily to a reduction in dividend and interest income from lower cash balances and a loss on disposal of assets in the third quarter
of 2024. 

Net Loss 

Net loss for the three months ended September 30,
2024 was 3,009,907, as compared to 2,444,009 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in loss of 565,898. Our electric
segment, which did not generate any revenue at this time, incurred a loss of 895,702 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, related
mostly to staffing costs and professional fees. Our gas-powered segment incurred a loss of 2,113,800 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, due largely to the rapid decline in orders for new boats during 2024. Basic and dilutive loss per share of common stock for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.26), as compared to 0.20) for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net Sales and Cost of Sales 

Our net sales decreased by 12,476,420, or 50 to
 12,504,482 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 24,980,902 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease
was due to a decrease in the number of boats sold during the first nine months of 2024 and the mix of boats sold. The number of boats
sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 61 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profits decreased by 2,178,813 or 89 to 333,996
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3,052,809 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage
of sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 2.7 and 12.2 respectively. Through continuous efficiency improvements,
the company was partially able to offset the impact of fixed cost deleveraging in the production facility as revenues declined 50 over
the same period last year. We continue to right size the workforce and drive efficiency in all parts of our cost structure. 

33 

Total Operating Expenses 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating
expenses were 10,525,509 and included an impairment charge of 1,674,000 related to the Forza impairment of property equipment
in the second quarter of 2024. Before the impact of this charge, operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
were 8,851,509 and 11,245,982, respectively, and as a percentage of sales were 70.8 compared to 45.0 in the prior year. Our total
operating expenses for our gas-powered boat segment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5,469,191 and 11,192,837,
respectively, and as a percentage of revenues were 43.7 and 44.8 , respectively. Our total operating expenses for Forza, our electric
powered boat and development segment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5,054,781 and 4,917,498, respectively. 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased
by approximately 24.2 , or 706,846 to 2,214,670 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,921,516 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The largest drivers of the decrease were reductions in sales and marketing expenses, hiring costs and office
supplies, primarily resulting from the decline in R D activity at Forza between periods. 

Salaries and wage related expenses decreased 34.7 ,
or 1,930,671 to 3,641,185 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5,571,856 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The majority of the decrease is due to reductions in staffing levels at Forza, as well as the staffing of Aquasport. Included in
salaries and wage related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was stock-based compensation expense of 1,022,894, Forza s
portion of that expense being 651,115. In total, stock-based compensation expense decreased by 413,991 or 28.8 as compared to the prior
year period. 

Research and development expenses decreased by 346,619,
or 37.3 , to 583,878 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 930,497 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease
was due primarily to lower R D activity in the Forza electric motor segment. 

Professional fees increased by 13.7 or 133,631 to
 1,111,079 for the nine months September 30, 2024, compared to 977,448 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to
merger related legal and related expenses incurred during the third quarter of 2024. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
54 , or 456,032 to 1,300,697 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 844,665 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. This increase is due to the addition of fixed assets, primarily building additions and molds, to increase our production levels
and support and throughput. 

Other income decreased by 1,689,741 to 327,215 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,016,956 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due
primarily to the first half of 2023 recognition of income from the Employee Retention Credit of 1,267,055 and a reduction in income generating
investment amounts.

was 9,864,298, as compared to 6,176,217 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in the net loss of 3,688,081. Our
electric segment, which did not generate any revenue, incurred a loss of 4,846,882 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related
mostly to staffing costs and research and development. Our gas-powered segment incurred a loss of 4,962,576 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, due largely to the rapid decline in orders for new boats during the first nine months of 2024. Basic and dilutive
loss per share of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.75), as compared to 0.46) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

A primary source of funds for the year ended December
31, 2023 and through September 30, 2024 was net cash received from our secondary offering, as well as Forza s initial public and
secondary offering and revenue generated from operations. Our primary use of cash was related to funding the expansion of our operations
through capital improvements, as well as molds for the expansion of Aquasport and Twin Vee models. With reduced demand, we have been
reducing inventory levels. Our priority over the next several months is to continue to reduce production costs and labor to match market
demand, complete the Twin Vee facility expansion and efficiency project, complete the addition of a wire harness assembly cell, continue
to expand the Twin Vee GFX 2 lineup, and develop and introduce a new Twin Vee BayCat line of boats, which will require additional investment
in molds and machinery. 

The following
table provides selected financial data about us as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 6,932,265. Our total liabilities were comprised of current liabilities of 3,843,294 which included accounts payable and accrued liabilities
of 3,153,884, leases liability of 651,235, contract liability of 38,175 and long-term liabilities of 3,088,971. As of December 31,
2023, we had 16,497,703 of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, 4,462,942 of marketable securities, total current assets of
 26,646,318 and total assets of 39,846,713. Our total current liabilities were 4,216,345 and total liabilities of 7,797,098 which included
long-term finance and operating leases liabilities of 3,080,853. 

The accumulated deficit was 21,491,078 as of September
30, 2024 compared to accumulated deficit of 14,346,984 as of December 31, 2023. 

Our working capital decreased by 10,894,286 to 11,535,687
as of September 30, 2024, compared to 22,429,972 on December 31, 2023 primarily due to continued development efforts at Forza which was
a non-revenue generating entity, the ongoing construction of the new manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Ft. Pierce, Florida,
and investments in molds for new boat designs. 

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will
provide sufficient resources to finance operations for the next 24 months from the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, we anticipate that we will be able to rely, in part, on cash flows from operations in
order to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure needs in the next year. We expect Forza s expenses to decrease as it curtails
its operation and the potential sale of its partially constructed manufacturing facility in McDowell, North Carolina, the cost of which
we expect will be paid for through the proceeds of Forza s public offerings, provided the conditions to receipt of the grant funding
are met, of which there can be no assurance.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net
cash flows used in operating activities was 4,638,887 compared to 6,930,130 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The use
of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a 9,864,298 net loss partially offset by a 1,591,390 reduction
in net inventory levels and depreciation and amortization of 1,300,697, stock-based compensation of 1,022,894, and an impairment of
property equipment of 1,674,000 since December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in operating
activities was 6,930,130. We increased inventory levels by 4,126,506, due to opening the AquaSport production facility and adding two
additional engine suppliers. Accounts receivable increased by 494,339, and accounts payable increased by 1,568,127. Our accrued expenses
decreased by 275,255 and prepaid expenses decreased by 332,142. Our net loss from operation was 6,176,217, and was decreased by non-cash
expenses of 2,591,485, the largest of these being stock-based compensation of 1,436,885, change of right-of-use asset and leases liabilities
of 355,519, and depreciation of 844,665. 

Cash Flow from Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash
used in investing activities was 567,889, due primarily to net sales of marketable securities partially offset by investments in property,
plant and equipment. This compares to a use of cash in investing activities of 11,061,664 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023
resulting from the investment of cash received from the Forza stock issuance into marketable securities and the purchase of property and
equipment. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net
cash used in financing activities was approximately 190,565 from finance lease obligations compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of 6,892,338 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from the issuance of Forza common stock. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

We believe that several accounting policies are important
to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas
generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different
estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used, which would have resulted in different financial results. 

Our management s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and make various assumptions, which management believes
to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

36 

The notes to our condensed consolidated financial
statements contained herein contain a summary of our significant accounting policies. We consider the following accounting policies critical
to the understanding of the results of our operations: 

Revenue Recognition 

Our revenue is derived primarily from the sale
of boats, motors and trailers to its independent dealers. We recognize revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are
satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to the dealer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is
released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a dealer. We typically receive payment within five business days of
shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. We offer dealer
incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other
allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in net sales in the statements of operations. The consideration recognized
represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives we reasonably expect to pay. The
estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to
incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or
reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer
incentives are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Payment received for the future sale of a boat to
a customer is recognized as a customer deposit. Customer deposits are recognized as revenue when control over promised goods is transferred
to the customer. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Included in those estimates
are assumptions about allowances for inventory obsolescence, useful life of fixed assets, warranty reserves and bad-debt reserves. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is defined as sales price less cost of completion,
disposable and transportation and a normal profit margin. Production costs, consisting of labor and overhead, are applied to ending finished
goods inventories at a rate based on estimated production capacity. Excess production costs are charged to cost of products sold. Provisions
are made when necessary to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their net realizable value. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived
assets when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing
the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to result from those assets over the remaining life to the assets net carrying amounts.
If the estimated undiscounted net cash flows are less than the net carrying amount, the assets would be adjusted to their fair value,
based on appraisal or the present value of the undiscounted net cash flows. 

37 

Product Warranty Costs 

As required by FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees ,
we are including the following disclosure applicable to our product warranties. 

We accrue for warranty costs based on the expected
material and labor costs to provide warranty replacement products. The methodology used in determining the liability for warranty cost
is based upon historical information and experience. Our warranty reserve is calculated as the gross sales multiplied by the historical
warranty expense return rate. 

Leases 

We adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases Topic 842 ), using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective date
of January 1, 2019. This standard requires all lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at
the present value of the lease payments. 

Under Topic 842, we applied a dual approach to all
leases whereby we are a lessee and classify leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the
lease is effectively a financed purchase by us. Lease classification is evaluated at the inception of the lease agreement. 

Deferred Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance 

We account for income taxes under ASC 740 Income
Taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets
if it is more likely than not that we will not realize tax assets through future operations . 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have,
any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2
of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

38 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in
the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed
to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such a date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective d ue
to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, related to not yet having retained sufficient staff
or engaged sufficient outside consultants with appropriate experience in GAAP presentation, especially of complex instruments. 

Remediation Plan 

Management has developed
and is executing a remediation plan to address the previously disclosed material weaknesses, due to inadequate staffing levels. We have
retained a full-time Senior Staff Accountant as well as a part-time staff accountant and we have implemented a robust ERP system. We will
continue to evaluate our needs as business conditions warrant. 

To remediate the existing
material weaknesses, additional time is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. The material weaknesses
cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded,
through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As of September 30, 2024, controls and procedures have been implemented
to remediate the material weakness, however testing of controls continues. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

We have incurred additional turnover of accounting
and finance personnel, and are currently in the process of hiring additional accounting staff and developing and refining our controls
and other procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC are recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and in accordance with GAAP. Other than as set forth
in this paragraph, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30,
2024 that has materially affected or is reasonable likely to materially affect our control over financial reporting. 

39 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may become involved in legal
proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings
that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement
costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Investing in our securities
involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually
materializes, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. The following information
updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes
from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Our failure to meet
the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock. 

The shares of our Common
Stock are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol VEEE. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing
requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements, the stockholder s equity requirement,
or the minimum closing bid price requirement, The Nasdaq Capital Market may take steps to de-list our Common Stock. Such a de-listing
or even notification of failure to comply with such requirements would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock
and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take
actions to restore our compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any
such action taken by us would allow our Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price, improve the liquidity of our
Common Stock, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below The Nasdaq Capital Market minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future
non-compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market s listing requirements. 

On May 10, 2024, we received
written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that for
the preceding 30 consecutive business days (March 28, 2024 through May 9, 2024), our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid
price of 1.00 Minimum Bid Price Requirement per share as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

In accordance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until November 6, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

40 

Since we did not achieve
compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by November 6, 2024, we were eligible for additional time to comply. Nasdaq granted
us until May 6, 2025 in order to cure the deficiency. 

We intend to actively monitor
the bid price of our common stock and will consider available options to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, including
such actions as effecting a reverse stock split to maintain our Nasdaq listing. 

The National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which
are referred to as covered securities. Because our Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, it is a covered
security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states
to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate
or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were to be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common
Stock would cease to be recognized as a covered security and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

We have incurred losses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, and could continue to incur losses in the future. 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred
a loss from operations of 11,987,299 and a net loss of 9,782,196. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from
operations of 10,191,513 and a net loss of 9,864,298. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 21,491,078. There
can be no assurance that expenses will not continue to increase in future periods or that the cash generated from operations in future
periods will be sufficient to satisfy our operating needs and to generate income from operations and net income. 

We depend on our network
of independent dealers for our gas-powered boats, face increasing competition for dealers, and have little control over their activities . 

A significant portion of our sales of our gas-powered
boats are derived from our network of independent dealers. We typically manufacture our gas-powered boats based upon indications of interest
received from dealers who are not contractually obligated to purchase any boats. While our dealers typically have purchased all of the
boats for which they have provided us with indications of interest, it is possible that a dealer could choose not to purchase boats for
which it has provided an indication of interest (e.g., if it were to have reached the credit limit on its floor plan), and as a result
we once experienced, and in the future could experience, excess inventory and costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, three individual dealers each
 represented over 10 of our total sales, or 38 in total. For the nine months ended September
30, 2023, one individual dealer represented over 10 of our sales, and that dealer represented 20 of total sales. The loss of
a significant dealer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers
supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. Competition
for dealers among other boat manufacturers continues to increase based on the quality, price, value, and availability of the manufacturers 
products, the manufacturers attention to customer service, and the marketing support that the manufacturer provides to the dealers.
We face intense competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers, affecting our ability to attract or retain
relationships with qualified and successful dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the performance
sport boat industry should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent
dealers in the boating industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more
of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A substantial
deterioration in the number of dealers or the quality of our network of dealers would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

41 

The loss of one or
a few dealers could have a material adverse effect on us. 

A few dealers have in the past, and may in the future,
account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, three individual dealers each represented over 10 of our total
sales, those dealers combined represented 38 of total sales. The loss of business from a significant dealer could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We have identified
weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional
material weaknesses will not occur in the future. 

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations continue to increase our
legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant
strain on our personnel, systems and resources. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things,
that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting. 

As of September 30, 2024, we do not yet have effective
disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls over all aspects of our financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and
refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules
and in accordance with GAAP. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial
reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We will be required to expend time and resources to further improve our
internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control
over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 

We will be required to expend time and resources to
further improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our staff. However, we cannot assure you that our
internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 

We are in the process of hiring additional staff and
providing them with the required training, we continue to engage outside consultants with appropriate experience in GAAP presentation,
especially of complex instruments, to devise and implement effective disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls. We will
be required to spend time and resources hiring and engaging additional staff and outside consultants with the appropriate experience to
remedy these weaknesses. We cannot assure you that management will be successful in locating and retaining appropriate candidates; that
newly engaged staff or outside consultants will be successful in remedying material weaknesses thus far identified or identifying material
weaknesses in the future; or that appropriate candidates will be located and retained prior to these deficiencies resulting in material
and adverse effects on our business. 

42 

Our current controls and any new controls that we
develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting from our international
expansion. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future.
Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm
our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements
for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect
the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting
that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls
and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm
is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an emerging
growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that
is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed
or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material
and adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. 

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER 

All of the Twin Vee and Forza executive officers
and most of their directors have conflicts of interest that may influence them to support or approve the Merger without regard to your
interests. 

All of the Twin Vee and Forza officers will be employed
by the combined company and several of each of their directors will continue to serve on the Board of Directors of the combined company
following the consummation of the Merger. In addition, all of the Twin Vee and Forza officers and most of their directors have a direct
or indirect financial interest in both Forza and Twin Vee. These interests, among others, may influence such executive officers and directors
of Twin Vee and Forza to support or approve the Merger. 

43 

The Exchange Ratio is not adjustable based on
the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock so the Merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than it had at
the time the Merger Agreement was signed. 

The parties to the Merger Agreement have set the Exchange
Ratio for the Forza Common Stock and the Exchange Ratio is not adjustable. Any changes in the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock or
Forza Common Stock will not affect the number of shares holders of Forza Common Stock will be entitled to receive upon consummation of
the Merger. Therefore, if the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement
prior to the consummation of the Merger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably less value. Similarly,
if the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock increases from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation
of the Merger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably more value than their shares of Forza Common Stock
and the Twin Vee stockholders immediately prior to the Merger will not be compensated for the increased market value of the Twin Vee Common
Stock. If the market price of Forza Common Stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation
of the Merger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably more value. Similarly, if the market price of Forza
Common Stock increases from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the Merger, Forza stockholders
could receive Merger consideration with considerably less value than their shares of Forza Common Stock and the Forza stockholders immediately
prior to the Merger will not be compensated for the increased market value of the Forza Common Stock. The Merger Agreement does not include
a price-based termination right. Because the Exchange Ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the value of Twin Vee Common Stock,
for each one percentage point that the market value of Twin Vee Common Stock rises or declines, there is a corresponding one percentage
point rise or decline, respectively, in the value of the total Merger consideration issued to the Forza stockholders. 

The Merger may be completed even though
material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes and other causes. 

In general, either Twin Vee or Forza can refuse
to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between August 12, 2024, the date of the Merger
Agreement, and the closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such
change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Twin Vee or Forza, including: 

general business or economic conditions affecting the industries in which Twin Vee or Forza operate; 

acts of war, armed hostilities or terrorism; 

changes in financial, banking or securities markets; 

the taking of any action required to be taken by the Merger Agreement; 

with respect either party, the announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement or any related transactions; or 

with respect to either party, any change in their or the other party s stock price or trading volume stock. 

If adverse changes occur and Twin Vee and Forza
still complete the Merger, the combined company stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the stockholders
of Twin Vee and Forza. 

44 

The combined company s stock price is
expected to be volatile, and the market price of its common stock may drop following the Merger. 

The market price of the combined company s common
stock could be subject to significant fluctuations following the Merger especially when the shareholder base is increased. Moreover, the
stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual
companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the combined company s common stock. 

In the past, following periods of volatility in the
market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies.
Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly
harm the combined company s profitability and reputation. 

The market price of the combined company s
common stock may decline as a result of the Merger. 

The market price of the combined company s common
stock may decline as a result of the Merger if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or
to the extent anticipated by Twin Vee or Forza or investors, financial or industry analysts. 

The combined company may not experience the
anticipated strategic benefits of the Merger. 

The respective managements of Twin Vee and Forza believe
that the Merger would provide certain strategic benefits that may not be realized by each of the companies operating as standalones. There
can be no assurance that these anticipated benefits of the Merger will materialize or that if they materialize will result in increased
stockholder value or revenue stream to the combined company. 

Twin Vee and Forza stockholders may not
realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger. 

If the combined company is
unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, Twin Vee and Forza securityholders
will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving any commensurate
benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic
and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger. 

If the conditions to the Merger are not met,
the Merger will not occur. 

Even if the Merger is approved by the stockholders
of Twin Vee and Forza, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived in order to complete the Merger, including, among others: 

the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection with the issuance of Twin Vee Common Stock in the Merger; 

the respective representations and warranties of Twin Vee and Forza, shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and the closing; 

45 

no material adverse effect with respect to Twin Vee or Forza or its subsidiaries shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger; 

performance or compliance in all material respects by Twin Vee and Forza with their respective covenants and obligations in the Merger Agreement; 

Forza and Twin Vee shall have obtained any consents and waivers of approvals required in connection with the Merger, including for Twin Vee approval of its stockholders of the issuance of the Twin Vee Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and for Forza approval of its stockholders of the Merger and the Merger Agreement; and 

no material adverse effect with respect to Twin Vee or Forza or their subsidiaries shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement. 

These and other conditions are described in detail
in the Merger Agreement. Twin Vee and Forza cannot assure you that all of the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied. If the conditions
to the Merger are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not occur or will be delayed, and Twin Vee and Forza each may lose some or
all of the intended benefits of the Merger. 

Twin Vee and Forza will incur substantial expenses
whether or not the Merger is completed. 

Twin Vee and Forza have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenses
related to the Merger whether or not the Merger is completed. 

Twin Vee will assume all of Forza s outstanding
liabilities if the Merger is completed. 

By operation of law, Twin Vee will assume all of Forza s
outstanding liabilities if the Merger is completed. 

During the pendency of the Merger, Twin Vee
and Forza may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the
Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses. 

Covenants in the Merger Agreement
impede the ability of Twin Vee and Forza to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, or complete
other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending the closing of the merger. As a result, if the Merger is not
completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during that period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect,
each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such
as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business, with any third-party, subject to certain
exceptions. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party s stockholders. 

Certain provisions
of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior
to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

The terms of the Merger Agreement
prohibit each of Twin Vee and Forza from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover
proposals, except in certain circumstances where the Twin Vee Board of Directors or Forza Board of Directors, as applicable, determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior takeover proposal and that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Forza Board of Directors. 

46 

Twin Vee s business and stock price may
be adversely affected if the acquisition of Forza is not completed. 

Twin Vee s acquisition of Forza is subject to
several customary conditions, including the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection with the
issuance of Twin Vee Common Stock in the Merger and the approvals of the transaction by the stockholders of Forza and Twin Vee. 

If Twin Vee s acquisition of Forza is not completed,
Twin Vee could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect Twin Vee s business and stock price, including: 

the current market price of shares of Twin Vee Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed; 

Twin Vee must pay costs related to the Merger; and 

Twin Vee would not realize the benefits it expects from acquiring Forza. 

If Twin Vee s acquisition of Forza is not completed,
Forza could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect Twin Vee s business and stock price, including: 

the current market price of shares of Forza Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed; 

Forza must pay costs related to the Merger; 

Forza may not be able to timely effect any stock split required in order for it to maintain its Nasdaq stock listing; and 

Forza would not realize the benefits it expects from being acquired by Twin Vee. 

Should the Merger not qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, Forza stockholders may recognize capital gain or loss with respect to the shares of Twin vee common stock received in
the Merger. 

The Merger is expected to be treated as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, however, neither Twin Vee nor Forza has received an Internal Revenue Services ruling to
that effect. The failure of the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code would result in a
Forza stockholder recognizing capital gain or loss with respect to the shares of Forza Common Stock surrendered for Twin Vee Common Stock
received in the Merger.
