We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the ticker symbol EPD. Our preferred units are not publicly traded. We were formed in April 1998 to own and operate certain natural gas liquids NGLs related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products. We are owned by our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP, which owns a non-economic general partner interest in us, manages our Partnership. We conduct substantially all of our business operations through EPO and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Our fully integrated, midstream energy asset network (or value chain links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. Our midstream energy operations include:

Senior Notes KKK were issued at 99.663 of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 5.55 per year. The Partnership guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.

Enterprise to Expand LPG Export Capacity at EHT

In July 2024, we announced plans to move forward with the construction of a fourth refrigeration train at our Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal EHT ). The addition of a fourth refrigeration train Ref 4 ), which is expected to be placed into service by the end of 2026, will increase our propane and butane export capabilities by approximately 300 MBPD. In addition to providing incremental LPG export capacity, Ref 4 will increase the instantaneous loading rates for propane and butane at EHT, while also making additional capacity available for propylene exports.

Enterprise Receives Deepwater Port License for SPOT Project

In April 2024, we received the deepwater port license for the Sea Port Oil Terminal SPOT from the U.S. Department of Transportation s Maritime Administration. The receipt of the deepwater port license is a significant milestone in the development and commercialization of SPOT.

Table of Contents 

As planned, SPOT would consist of proposed onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 nautical miles off the Texas coast in approximately 115 feet of water. SPOT is designed to load Very Large Crude Carriers VLCCs and other crude oil tankers at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour. The platform would be connected to an onshore storage facility with approximately 4.8 MMBbls of capacity in Brazoria County, Texas, by two 36-inch, bi-directional pipelines. The SPOT project includes state-of-the-art pipeline control, vapor recovery and leak detection systems that are designed to minimize emissions. SPOT would provide customers with an efficient export solution that leverages our extensive integrated supply, storage and distribution network. 

We continue our efforts to commercialize this project in order to support a final investment decision.

Enterprise to Build Mentone West 2; Mentone 3 and Leonidas Begin Service

In April 2024, we announced plans to further expand our natural gas processing capabilities in the Delaware Basin with construction of a second natural gas processing train at our Mentone West location Mentone West 2 in Loving County, Texas. This natural gas processing train, which will have the capacity to process more than 300 MMcf/d of natural gas and extract in excess of 40 MBPD of NGLs, is expected to begin service during the first half of 2026.

Additionally, we placed into service our third natural gas processing train at Mentone in the Delaware Basin Mentone 3 and our seventh Midland Basin natural gas processing train Leonidas ). Both Mentone 3 and Leonidas are capable of processing over 300 MMcf/d of natural gas and extracting more than 40 MBPD of NGLs. Supported by a combination of long-term producer dedications and minimum volume commitments, Mentone 3 and Leonidas will support Permian Basin producers as they meet growing demand in the U.S. and internationally.

Enterprise Begins Service on TW Products System

In March 2024, we placed into service the first phase of our Texas Western Products System TW Products System and began truck loading operations at our new Permian terminal in Gaines County, Texas. Additionally, we placed into service and began truck loading operations at our Jal and Moriarty Terminals located in New Mexico during the second quarter of 2024 and our Grand Junction Terminal located in Utah in October 2024. On a combined basis, the four terminals offer 1.5 MMBbls of refined products storage capacity and can load up to 63 MBPD.

Enterprise Acquires Equity Interests from Western Midstream

In February 2024, we announced that we had acquired the remaining equity interests in Whitethorn Pipeline Company LLC Whitethorn and Enterprise EF78 LLC EF78 from affiliates of Western Midstream Partners, LP Western Midstream for 375 million in total cash consideration. This transaction, which closed on February 16, 2024, was funded using cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper program.

Additionally, on March 27, 2024, we acquired an additional 15 equity interest in Panola Pipeline Company, LLC Panola from an affiliate of Western Midstream for 25 million in cash consideration. We funded the cash consideration using cash on hand.

Issuance of 2.0 Billion of Senior Notes in January 2024

In January 2024, EPO issued 2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) 1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2027 Senior Notes HHH and (ii) 1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2034 Senior Notes III ). Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments, and the repayment of debt (including the repayment of all of our 850 million principal amount of 3.90 Senior Notes JJ at their maturity in February 2024 and amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program).

Senior Notes HHH were issued at 99.897 of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.60 per year. Senior Notes III were issued at 99.705 of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.85 per year. The Partnership guaranteed these senior notes through an unconditional guarantee on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.

 The Indicative Gas Processing Gross Spread represents our generic estimate of the gross economic benefit from extracting NGLs from natural gas production based on certain pricing assumptions. Specifically, it is the amount by which the assumed economic value of a composite gallon of NGLs in Chambers County, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana. Our estimate of the indicative spread does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the NGLs to market. In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is further influenced by regional pricing and extraction dynamics.

The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was 0.57 per gallon in the third quarter of 2024 versus 0.61 per gallon in the third quarter of 2023. Likewise, the weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was 0.59 per gallon during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.61 per gallon during the same period in 2023.

Table of Contents 

Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity prices. An increase in our consolidated marketing revenues due to higher energy commodity sales prices may not result in an increase in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be expected to increase due to comparable increases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities. The same type of relationship would be true in the case of lower energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs.

We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements. See Note 13 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part I, Item 3 of this quarterly report for information regarding our commodity hedging activities.

Impact of Inflation 

Inflation rates in the U.S. increased significantly in 2022 and remain elevated in 2024 compared to recent historical levels. While pandemic-era supply chain disruptions have largely dissipated and measures taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank have helped slow the growth of inflation, the high cost environment that began in 2022 generally remains intact in 2024. However, to the extent that a rising cost environment impacts our results, there are typically offsetting benefits either inherent in our business or that result from other steps we take proactively to reduce the impact of inflation on our net operating results. These benefits include: (1) provisions included in our long-term fee-based revenue contracts that offset cost increases in the form of rate escalations based on positive changes in the U.S. Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index for Finished Goods or other factors; (2) provisions in other revenue contracts that enable us to pass through higher energy costs to customers in the form of gas, electricity and fuel rebills or surcharges; and (3) higher commodity prices, which generally enhance our results in the form of increased volumetric throughput and demand for our services. Additionally, we take measures to mitigate the impact of cost increases in certain commodities, including a portion of our electricity needs, using fixed-price, term purchase agreements or financial derivatives. For these reasons, the increased cost environment, caused in part by inflation, has not had a material impact on our historical results of operations for the periods presented in this report. However, a significant or prolonged period of high inflation could adversely impact our results if costs were to increase at a rate greater than the increase in the revenues we receive.

See Capital Investments within this Part I, Item 2 for a discussion of the impact of inflation on our capital investment decisions.

 The weighted-average interest rates on debt principal outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.59 and 4.60 , respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on debt principal outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 4.55 and 4.56 , respectively.

 We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase. Capitalized interest amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service. When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would be otherwise. Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the interest rates charged on borrowings.

Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, increased a net 28 million quarter-to-quarter. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of 2.0 billion and 2.5 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in January 2024 and August 2024, respectively, which accounted for a combined 43 million increase, partially offset by an 8 million decrease as a result of the retirement of 850 million of fixed-rate senior notes in February 2024 and an additional 7 million decrease from a reduction in outstanding commercial paper notes .

Interest charged on debt principal outstanding increased a net 59 million period-to-period. This increase was primarily due to the aforementioned issuance of senior notes, which accounted for an 88 million increase, partially offset by a 29 million decrease as a result of the retirement of 1.25 billion and 850 million of fixed-rate senior notes in March 2023 and February 2024, respectively. 

For additional information regarding our debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. For a discussion of our capital projects, see Capital Investments within this Part I, Item 2.

Income taxes

Our income taxes are primarily comprised of our state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax Texas Margin Tax ). Our provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3 million and increased 10 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023.

Business Segment Highlights 

Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines Services, (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines Services and (iv) Petrochemical Refined Products Services. Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or sold.

We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. 

The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and total gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted accounting principle non-GAAP financial measure, for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):

 Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Gross operating margin is presented on a 100 basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Segment gross operating margin for NGL Pipelines Services and Crude Oil Pipelines Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights that are included in management s evaluation of segment results. However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total gross operating margin.

The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income. For a discussion of operating income and its components, see the previous section titled Income Statement Highlights within this Part I, Item 2.

Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities. The main purpose of our marketing activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment. In performing these support roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross operating margin for us. The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this quarterly report), we believe that the Partnership and its consolidated businesses will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund their capital investments and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. At September 30, 2024, we had 5.6 billion of consolidated liquidity. This amount was comprised of 4.2 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO s revolving credit facilities and 1.4 billion of unrestricted cash on hand.

We may issue debt and equity securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those related to capital investments. We have a universal shelf registration statement (the 2021 Shelf on file with the SEC which allows the Partnership and EPO to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively. The 2021 Shelf will expire in November 2024, at which time we expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement. In addition, we have a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to 2.5 billion of the Partnership s common units in amounts, at prices and on terms based on market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings (referred to as the Partnership s at-the-market ATM program). 

Enterprise Declares Cash Distribution for Third Quarter of 2024

On October 2 , 2024, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly cash distribution of 0.525 per common unit, or 2.10 per unit on an annualized basis, to be paid to the Partnership s common unitholders with respect to the third quarter of 2024. The quarterly distribution is payable on November 14 , 2024 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on October 31, 2024. The total amount to be paid is 1.15 billion, which includes 11 million for distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards.

The payment of quarterly cash distributions is subject to management s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in connection with such payments and Board approval. Management will evaluate any future increases in cash distributions on a quarterly basis.

In January 2024, EPO issued 2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) 1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2027 Senior Notes HHH and (ii) 1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January 2034 Senior Notes III ). Senior Notes HHH were issued at 99.897 of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.60 per year. Senior Notes III were issued at 99.705 of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.85 per year. Net proceeds from this offering were used by EPO for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments, and the repayment of debt (including the repayment of all of our 850 million principal amount of 3.90 Senior Notes JJ at their maturity in February 2024 and amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program).

In March 2024, EPO entered into a new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the March 2024 1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement that replaced its prior 364-day revolving credit agreement. The March 2024 1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in March 2025. EPO s borrowing capacity was unchanged from the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there are no principal amounts outstanding under this new revolving credit agreement.

In August 2024, EPO issued 2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) 1.1 billion principal amount of senior notes due February 2035 Senior Notes JJJ and (ii) 1.4 billion principal amount of senior notes due February 2055 Senior Notes KKK ). Senior Notes JJJ were issued at 99.400 of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 4.95 per year. Senior Notes KKK were issued at 99.663 of their principal amount and have a fixed interest rate of 5.55 per year. Net proceeds from this offering will be used by EPO for general company purposes, including for growth capital investments, and the repayment of debt (including the repayment of all or a portion of our 1.15 billion principal amount of 3.75 Senior Notes MM at their maturity in February 2025).

For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Credit Ratings

As of November 8 , 2024, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were A- from Standard and Poor s, A3 from Moody s and A- from Fitch Ratings. In addition, the credit ratings of EPO s short-term senior unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor s, P-2 from Moody s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings. EPO s credit ratings reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that circumstances warrant such a change. A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings from other rating agencies.

Common Unit Repurchases Under 2019 Buyback Program

In January 2019, we announced that the Board had approved a 2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the 2019 Buyback Program ), which provides the Partnership with an additional method to return capital to investors. The Partnership repurchased 2,646,351 and 5,452,767 common units through open market purchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The total cost of these repurchases, including commissions and fees, was 76 million and 156 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was 926 million.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities. Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, public health emergencies, adverse weather conditions and government regulations affecting prices and production levels. We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay and dedication agreements. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Risk Factors included under Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K.

For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

The following information highlights significant period-to-period fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts:

Operating activities 

 Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 554 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to:

a 438 million period-to-period increase resulting from higher partnership earnings (determined by adjusting our 282 million period-to-period increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows); and

a 143 mill ion period-to-period increase from changes in operating accounts primarily due to the use of working capital employed in our marketing activities, which includes the impact of (i) fluctuations in commodity prices, (ii) timing of our inventory purchase and sale strategies, and (iii) changes in margin deposit requirements associated with our commodity derivative instruments.

For information regarding significant period-to-period changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see Income Statement Highlights and Business Segment Highlights within this Part I, Item 2.

Investing activities 

 Net cash flow used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 billion when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in investments for property, plant and equipment (see Capital Investments within this Part I, Item 2 for additional information).

59

Table of Contents 

Financing activities 

 Net cash flow used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased a net 1.9 billion when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to:

a net cash inflow of 3.1 billion related to debt transactions that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net cash inflow of 627 million related to debt transactions that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of 850 million principal amount of senior notes and net repayments of 450 million under EPO s commercial paper program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and issued a net 126 million under EPO s commercial paper program, partially offset by the repayment of 1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes; partially offset by

a 400 million cash outflow during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In February 2024, we acquired the remaining 20 equity interest in Whitethorn and remaining 25 equity interest in EF78 from affiliates of Western Midstream for total cash consideration of 375 million. In March 2024, we acquired an additional 15 equity interest in Panola from an affiliate of Western Midstream for 25 million in cash consideration; and

a 159 million period-to-period increase in cash distributions paid to common unitholders primarily attributable to increases in the quarterly cash distribution rate per unit.

Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures

Distributable Cash Flow and Operational Distributable Cash Flow 

 Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets. 

We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow DCF ), which is a non-GAAP liquidity measure. DCF is an important financial measure for our common unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions. DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our common unitholders. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Based on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board, which has sole authority in approving such matters. Enterprise GP has a non-economic ownership interest in the Partnership and is not entitled to receive any cash distributions from it based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests.

Operational distributable cash flow Operational DCF ), which is defined as DCF excluding the impact of proceeds from asset sales and other matters and monetization of interest rate derivative instruments, is a supplemental non-GAAP liquidity measure that quantifies the portion of cash available for distribution to common unitholders that was generated from our normal operations. We believe that it is important to consider this non-GAAP measure as it provides an enhanced perspective of our assets ability to generate cash flows without regard for certain items that do not reflect our core operations.

Our use of DCF and Operational DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this quarterly report is not a substitute for net cash flow provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure to DCF and Operational DCF. For a discussion of net cash flow provided by operating activities, see Cash Flow Statement Highlights within this Part I, Item 2.

Capital Investments 

Since the beginning of 2024, we placed into service two natural gas processing trains in the Permian Basin and our TW Products System. We have approximately 6.9 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026, including the following major projects (including their respective scheduled completion dates): 

natural gas gathering expansion projects in the Delaware and Midland Basins (2024 and 2025);

the Bahia NGL Pipeline (third quarter of 2025);

an NGL fractionator Frac 14 and an associated DIB unit at our Mont Belvieu area NGL fractionation complex (third quarter of 2025);

our first natural gas processing train at our Mentone West location in the Delaware Basin (third quarter of 2025);

an eighth natural gas processing train Orion in the Midland Basin (third quarter of 2025);

an expansion of our Morgan s Point terminal to increase ethylene export capacity and enhance our ethane loading capabilities (fourth quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2025);

our Neches River Ethane / Propane Export Facility located in Orange County, Texas (third quarter of 2025 and first half of 2026);

our second natural gas processing train at our Mentone West location in the Delaware Basin (first half of 2026); and

the expansion of our LPG and PGP export capacity at EHT, including Ref 4 (fourth quarter of 2026).

Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2024, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests, to approximate 4.14 billion to 4.39 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of 3.5 billion to 3.75 billion and sustaining capital expenditures of 640 million. These amounts do not include capital investments associated with our proposed deep-water offshore crude oil terminal (SPOT), which remains subject to a final investment decision.

Table of Contents 

In August 2024, we announced that an affiliate of Enterprise entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pi on Midstream for 950 million. This transaction, which closed October 28, 2024, was funded using cash on hand.

Our forecast of capital investments is dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flow or other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential divestitures. We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices resulting from raw material or labor shortages, supply chain disruptions or inflation. Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change over time based on future decisions by management, which may include changing the scope or timing of projects or cancelling projects altogether. Our success in raising capital, having the ability to increase revenues commensurate with cost increases and our ability to partner with other companies to share project costs and risks, continue to be significant factors in determining how much capital we can invest. We believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may revise our plans in response to changes in economic and capital market conditions.

The following table summarizes our capital investments for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):

 Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. In total, these amounts represent Capital expenditures as presented on our Unaudited Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

(2)
 
 Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams, cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional revenue streams and cash flows.

(3)
 
 Sustaining capital projects are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings. Sustaining capital expenditures include the costs of major maintenance activities at our reaction-based plants, which are accounted for using the deferral method.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

In total, investments in growth capital projects increased 1.0 billion period-to-period primarily due to the following:

higher investments in ethane, ethylene, and LPG export expansion projects at our Gulf Coast terminals, which accounted for a 417 million increase;

higher investments in our Bahia NGL Pipeline, which accounted for a 349 million increase; and

higher investments in the construction of natural gas processing trains and related gathering system expansions in the Delaware and Midland Basins, which accounted for an additional 192 million increase.

Investments attributable to sustaining capital projects increased 226 million period-to-period primarily due to higher major maintenance activities performed at certain of our reaction-based plants (e.g., our PDH and iBDH facilities) and fluctuations in timing and costs of pipeline integrity and similar projects.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our 2023 Form 10-K. The following types of estimates, in our opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of professional judgment and involve complex analysis:

depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment;

measuring recoverability of long-lived assets and fair value of equity method investments;

amortization methods of customer relationships and contract-based intangible assets;

methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill and related assets; and

the use of estimates for revenue and expenses.

When used to prepare our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the foregoing types of estimates are based on our current knowledge and understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances. Such estimates may be revised as a result of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other Matters 

Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationship

The Partnership (the Parent Guarantor has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the consolidated debt obligations of EPO (the Subsidiary Issuer ), with the exception of the remaining debt obligations of TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (collectively, the Guaranteed Debt ). If EPO were to default on any of its Guaranteed Debt, the Partnership would be responsible for full and unconditional repayment of such obligations. At September 30, 2024, the total amount of Guaranteed Debt was 32.5 billion, which was comprised of 29.9 billion of EPO s senior notes, 2.3 billion of EPO s junior subordinated notes, and 270 million of related accrued interest.

The Partnership s guarantees of EPO s senior note obligations, commercial paper notes and borrowings under bank credit facilities represent unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. In addition, these guarantees effectively rank junior in right of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured and unsubordinated, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness.

The Partnership s guarantees of EPO s junior subordinated notes represent unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Partnership and senior in right of payment to all existing or future equity securities of the Partnership. The Partnership s guarantees of EPO s junior subordinated notes effectively rank junior in right of payment to (i) any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness and (ii) all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership.

The Partnership may be released from its guarantee obligations only in connection with EPO s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance options as described in the underlying agreements.

Selected Financial Information of Obligor Group 

 The following tables present summarized financial information of the Partnership (as Parent Guarantor) and EPO (as Subsidiary Issuer) on a combined basis (collectively, the Obligor Group ), after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group.

In accordance with Rule 13.01 of Regulation S-X, the summarized financial information of the Obligor Group excludes the Obligor Group s equity in income and investments in the consolidated subsidiaries of EPO that are not party to the guarantee obligations (the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries ). The total carrying value of the Obligor Group s investments in the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries was 48.0 billion at September 30, 2024. The Obligor Group s equity in the earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.0 billion. Although the net assets and earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries are not directly available to the holders of the Guaranteed Debt to satisfy the repayment of such obligations, there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries to pay distributions or make loans to EPO or the Partnership. EPO exercises control over the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries. We continue to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Partnership presented under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report provide a more appropriate view of our credit standing. Our investment grade credit ratings are based on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements and not the Obligor Group s financial information presented below.

ITEM 3. QUANT ITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

 ABOUT MARKET RISK.

General 

In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics. Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities.

We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model. This approach measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10 change in the underlying interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day. In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding. The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate. Therefore, the impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable) would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction assuming:

the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk;

the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and

the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period.

We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions. Accordingly, the nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed.

Commodity Hedging Activities 

The price of energy commodities such as natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products and power are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps.

At September 30, 2024, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing margins, (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory and (iv) hedging anticipated future purchases of power for certain operations in Southeast Texas. For a summary of our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments outstanding, see Note 13 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Sensitivity Analysis

The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair values of our principal commodity derivative instrument portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions).

The fair value information presented in the sensitivity analysis tables excludes the impact of applying Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with variation margin payments. As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

Interest Rate Hedging Activities 

We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps, options to enter into forward-starting swaps swaptions ), treasury locks and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain consolidated debt agreements. This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings. As of the filing date of this quarterly report, we do not have any interest rate hedging instruments outstanding.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of (i) A. James Teague, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise GP, (ii) W. Randall Fowler, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise GP and (iii) R. Daniel Boss, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Enterprise GP, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, Messrs. Teague, Fowler and Boss concluded:

(i) 
 that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures; and

(ii) 
 that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the third quarter of 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Section 302 and 906 Certifications

The required certifications of Messrs. Teague, Fowler and Boss under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are included as exhibits to this quarterly report (see Exhibits 31 and 32 under Part II, Item 6 of this quarterly report).

PART II. O THER INFORMATION. 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

As part of our normal business activities, we may be named as defendants in litigation and legal proceedings, including those arising from regulatory and environmental matters. Although we are insured against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent, there is no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate, in every case, to indemnify us against liabilities arising from future legal proceedings. We will vigorously defend the Partnership in litigation matters.

For additional information regarding our litigation matters, see Note 16 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

On occasion, we are assessed monetary penalties by governmental authorities related to administrative or judicial proceedings involving environmental matters. The following information summarizes matters where the eventual resolution of each of these matters may result in monetary sanctions in excess of 0.3 million. We do not expect that any expenditures related to the following matters will be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2019, we received a Notice of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA in connection with regulatory requirements applicable to facilities that we operate near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 

In August 2022, we received a Notice of Violation from the U.S. EPA alleging that gasoline at two of our refined products terminals in Texas had exceeded certain Clean Air Act-related standards during two past regulatory control periods.

In August 2022, we received two Notices of Enforcement from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for alleged exceedances of air permit emission limits at our PDH 1 and iBDH facilities in Texas.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

An investment in our securities involves certain risks. Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risks described under Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K, in addition to other information in such annual report and this quarterly report. The risk factors set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.

Recent Issuances of Unregistered Securities 

Holders of our Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of 7.25 per annum. We may satisfy our obligation to pay distributions to the preferred unitholders through the issuance, in whole or in part, of additional preferred units (referred to as paid-in-kind or PIK distributions), with the remainder in cash, subject to certain rights of a holder to elect all cash and other conditions as described in our partnership agreement.

The Partnership made quarterly PIK distributions to preferred unitholders in the first, second and third quarters of 2024 of 19,423, 19,865 and 20,225 preferred units, respectively. With the exception of 90 and 92 preferred units distributed in the second and third quarters of 2024, respectively, to an unaffiliated third party, all of the PIK distributions made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were to OTA Holdings, Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership OTA ). The preferred units held by OTA are accounted for as treasury units in consolidation. For additional information regarding the preferred units, see Note 8 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

The issuance of preferred units as PIK distributions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were undertaken in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof.

Other than as described above, there were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the third quarter of 2024.
