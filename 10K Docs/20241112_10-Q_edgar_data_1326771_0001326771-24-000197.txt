 NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

District Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks). The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that were organized under the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, as amended (FHLBank Act), to serve the public by enhancing the availability of credit for residential mortgages and targeted community development. The FHLB is regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency). The FHLBanks are financial cooperatives that provide a readily available, competitively-priced source of funds to their member institutions.

 allowance for credit losses was recorded for these assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Carrying values of interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds sold exclude accrued interest receivable of (in thousands) and as of September 30, 2024, and and as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are short-term and are structured such that they are evaluated regularly to determine if the market value of the underlying securities decreases below the market value required as collateral (i.e., subject to collateral maintenance provisions). If so, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash, generally by the next business day. Based upon the collateral held as security and collateral maintenance provisions with counterparties, the FHLB determined that allowance for credit losses was needed for its securities purchased under agreements to resell at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying value of securities purchased under agreements to resell excludes accrued interest receivable of (in thousands) and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Debt Securities 
 
 The FHLB invests in debt securities, which are classified as either trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. The FHLB is prohibited by Finance Agency regulations from purchasing certain higher-risk securities, such as equity securities and debt instruments that are not investment quality, other than certain investments targeted at low-income persons or communities. The FHLB is not required to divest instruments that experience credit deterioration after their purchase.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the FHLB did t sell any held-to-maturity securities. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Securities 
 
 The FHLB evaluates available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities for credit losses on a quarterly basis. The FHLB s available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are U.S. Treasury obligations, GSE obligations, and MBS issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae that are backed by single-family or multi-family mortgage loans. The FHLB only purchases securities considered investment quality. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities were rated single-A, or above, by an NRSRO, based on the lowest long-term credit rating for each security owned by the FHLB. The FHLB s internal ratings of these securities may differ from those obtained from an NRSRO. 
 
 The FHLB evaluates individual available-for-sale securities for impairment by comparing the security s fair value to its amortized cost. Impairment may exist when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost (i.e., in an unrealized loss position). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, certain available-for-sale securities were in an unrealized loss position. These losses are considered temporary as the FHLB expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on these available-for-sale investment securities and does not intend to sell these securities nor considers it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis. Further, the FHLB has not experienced any payment defaults on the instruments at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 and all of these securities are highly-rated. In the case of U.S. obligations, they carry an explicit government guarantee. In the case of GSE securities, they are purchased under the assumption that the issuers' obligation to pay principal and interest on those securities will be honored, taking into account their status as GSEs. As a result, allowance for credit losses was recorded on these available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The FHLB evaluates its held-to-maturity securities for impairment on a collective, or pooled basis, unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the FHLB had t established an allowance for credit loss on any held-to-maturity securities because the securities: (1) were all highly-rated and/or had short remaining terms to maturity, (2) had not experienced, nor did the FHLB

 The FHLB offers certain fixed- and variable-rate Advances to members that may be prepaid on specified dates (call dates) without incurring prepayment or termination fees (callable Advances). Other Advances may only be prepaid subject to a prepayment fee paid to the FHLB that makes the FHLB financially indifferent to the prepayment of the Advance.

 The FHLB also offers putable Advances. With a putable Advance, the FHLB effectively purchases put options from the member that allows the FHLB to terminate the Advance at predetermined dates. The FHLB normally would exercise its put option when interest rates increase relative to contractual rates.

 Credit Risk Exposure and Security Terms 
 
 The FHLB manages its credit exposure to Advances through an integrated approach that includes establishing a credit limit for each borrower and ongoing review of each borrower's financial condition, coupled with collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. 
 
 In addition, the FHLB lends to eligible borrowers in accordance with federal law and Finance Agency regulations, which require the FHLB to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure credit products. Under these regulations, collateral eligible to secure new or renewed Advances includes: 
 
 one-to-four family mortgage loans (delinquent for no more than 60 days) and multi-family mortgage loans (delinquent for no more than 30 days) and securities representing such mortgages; 
 loans and securities issued and insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any U.S. government agency (for example, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae); 
 cash or deposits in the FHLB; 
 certain other collateral that is real estate-related, provided that the collateral has a readily ascertainable value, can be reliably discounted to account for liquidation and other risks, can be liquidated in due course and the FHLB can perfect a security interest in it; and 
 certain qualifying securities representing undivided equity interests in eligible Advance collateral. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans are the principal form of collateral for Advances. The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each member's credit products is calculated by applying collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the value of the collateral. In addition, community financial institutions are eligible to utilize expanded statutory collateral provisions for small business and agribusiness loans. The FHLB's capital stock owned by its member borrowers is also pledged as collateral. Collateral arrangements and a member s borrowing capacity vary based on the financial condition and performance of the institution, the types of collateral pledged and the overall quality of those assets. The FHLB can also require additional or substitute collateral to protect its security interest. The FHLB also has policies and procedures for validating the reasonableness of its collateral valuations and makes changes to its collateral guidelines, as necessary, based on current market conditions. In addition, collateral verifications and reviews are performed by the FHLB based on the risk profile of the borrower. Management of the FHLB believes that these policies effectively manage the FHLB's credit risk from Advances. 
 
 Members experiencing financial difficulties are subject to FHLB-performed stress tests to evaluate the impact of poorly performing assets on the member s capital and loss reserve positions. Depending on the results of these tests, a member may be allowed to maintain pledged loan assets in its custody, may be required to deliver those loans into the custody of the FHLB or its agent, or may be required to provide details on those loans to facilitate an estimate of their fair value. The FHLB perfects its security interest in all pledged collateral. The FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the FHLB by a member

 t have any Advances that were past due, in non-accrual status or considered impaired. In addition, there were modifications of Advances with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the FHLB had rights to collateral on a member-by-member basis with an estimated value in excess of its outstanding extensions of credit. 
 
 Based upon the collateral held as security, its credit extension and collateral policies and the repayment history on Advances, the FHLB did not expect any credit losses on Advances as of September 30, 2024 and, therefore, allowance for credit losses on Advances was recorded. For the same reasons, the FHLB did t record any allowance for credit losses on Advances at December 31, 2023.

 Credit Risk Exposure 
 
 The FHLB manages credit risk exposure for conventional mortgage loans primarily though conservative underwriting and purchasing loans with characteristics consistent with favorable expected credit performance and by applying various credit enhancements. 
 
 Credit Enhancements. The conventional mortgage loans under the MPP are primarily supported by some combination of credit enhancements (primary mortgage insurance (PMI) and the Lender Risk Account (LRA), including pooled LRA for those members participating in an aggregated MPP pool). These credit enhancements apply after a homeowner s equity is exhausted. The LRA is funded by the FHLB upfront as a portion of the purchase proceeds to cover potential credit losses. The LRA is recorded in other liabilities in the Statements of Condition. Excess funds from the LRA are released to the member in accordance with the terms of the Master Commitment Contract, which is typically after five years, subject to performance of the related loan pool. Because the FHA makes an explicit guarantee on FHA mortgage loans, the FHLB does not require any credit enhancements on these loans beyond primary mortgage insurance.

 Payment Status of Mortgage Loans. The key credit quality indicator for conventional mortgage loans is payment status, which allows the FHLB to monitor borrower performance. Past due loans are those where the borrower has failed to make a full payment of principal and interest within one month of its due date. Table 5.5 presents the payment status of conventional mortgage loans.

 The FHLB did t have any real estate owned at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 Mortgage Loan Modifications . Under certain circumstances, the FHLB offers loan modifications within its MPP. Most commonly, loan modifications consist of capitalization of any past due interest with a corresponding increase in unpaid principal and a recast of the monthly principal and interest payment. Less frequently, loan modifications may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, balloon payments, or a combination of these types. The amortized cost basis of mortgage loans modified with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (in thousands) and , respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (in thousands) and , respectively. The financial effect of the modifications was not material to the FHLB s financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the FHLB's allowance for credit losses on its conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio was (in thousands) and , respectively. For additional information on the FHLB's methodology to determine current expected credit losses, see Note 6 - Mortgage Loans in the FHLB's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Credit Risk on Derivatives 
 
 The FHLB is subject to credit risk given the risk of non-performance by counterparties to its derivative transactions and manages credit risk through credit analyses of derivative counterparties, collateral requirements and adherence to the requirements set forth in its policies, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations, and Finance Agency regulations. 
 
 For uncleared derivatives, the degree of credit risk depends on the extent to which master netting arrangements are included in these contracts to mitigate this risk. The FHLB requires collateral agreements on its uncleared derivatives with the collateral delivery threshold set to zero. 
 
 For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse is the FHLB's counterparty. The Clearinghouse notifies the clearing agent of the required initial and variation margin and the clearing agent in turn notifies the FHLB. The FHLB utilizes two Clearinghouses for all cleared derivative transactions, LCH Ltd. and CME Clearing. At both Clearinghouses, variation margin is characterized as daily settlement payments, while initial margin is considered to be collateral. The requirement that the FHLB post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the FHLB to credit risk if the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral/payments for changes in the value of cleared derivatives is posted daily through a clearing agent. On the Statements of Cash Flows, the variation margin cash payments, or daily settlement payments, are included in net change in derivative and hedging activities, as an operating activity.

Note 12 - 

Fair Value Hierarchy . GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of how market observable the fair value measurement is. 
 
 The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 
 
 Level 1 Inputs - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the reporting entity can access on the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which the transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
 
 Level 2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, and implied volatilities); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
 
 Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are supported by limited to no market activity and reflect the FHLB's own assumptions. 
 
 The FHLB did have any transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 
 Table 12.1 presents the carrying value, fair value, and fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities of the FHLB. The FHLB records trading securities, available-for-sale securities, derivative assets, derivative liabilities, certain Advances and certain Consolidated Obligations at fair value on a recurring basis, and on occasion, certain mortgage loans held for portfolio on a nonrecurring basis. The FHLB records all other financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost. Refer to Table 12.2 for further details about the financial assets and liabilities held at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis.

 Summary of Valuation Methodologies and Primary Inputs .

 Fair Value Option . The fair value option provides an irrevocable option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments not previously carried at fair value. It requires a company to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value on the face of the Statements of Condition. Fair value is used for both the initial and subsequent measurement of the designated assets, liabilities and commitments, with the changes in fair value recognized in net income. If elected, interest income and interest expense on Advances and Consolidated Obligations carried at fair value are recognized based solely on the contractual amount of interest due or unpaid. Any transaction fees or costs are immediately recognized into other non-interest income or other non-interest expense. 
 
 The FHLB has elected the fair value option for certain financial instruments that either do not qualify for hedge accounting or may be at risk for not meeting hedge effectiveness requirements. These fair value elections were made primarily in an effort to mitigate the potential income statement volatility that can arise from economic hedging relationships in which the carrying value of the hedged item is not adjusted for changes in fair value.

 For instruments recorded under the fair value option, the related contractual interest income, contractual interest expense and the discount amortization on Discount Notes are recorded as part of net interest income on the Statements of Income. The remaining changes in fair value for instruments in which the fair value option has been elected are recorded as Net gains (losses) on financial instruments held under fair value option in the Statements of Income, except for changes in fair value related to instrument specific credit risk, which are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Statements of Condition. The FHLB has determined that none of the remaining changes in fair value were related to instrument-specific credit risk for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. In determining that there has been change in instrument-specific credit risk period to period, the FHLB primarily considered the following factors: 
 
 The FHLB is a federally chartered GSE, and as a result of this status, the FHLB s Consolidated Obligations have historically received the same credit ratings as the government bond credit rating of the United States, even though they are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by the United States. 
 
 The FHLB is jointly and severally liable with the other 10 FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all Consolidated Obligations of each of the other FHLBanks. 
 
 The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate unpaid principal balance outstanding and the aggregate fair value for Advances and Consolidated Obligations for which the fair value option has been elected.

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we delivered on our dual mission of providing access to ongoing liquidity funding to member financial institutions and expanding support for affordable housing and community investment. We continue to monitor the changing economic landscape and are committed to assisting members in meeting their funding needs. 
 
 We maintained strong profitability, which enabled us to bolster capital adequacy by increasing retained earnings, to pay a competitive dividend rate to stockholders, and to make meaningful contributions to affordable housing. We exceeded all minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, and we were able to fund operations through the issuance of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs. Additionally, overall residual credit risk exposure from our Credit Services, mortgage loan portfolio, investments, and derivative transactions has remained de minimis. Likewise, our market risk measures continue to be within our risk appetite. 
 
 Affordable Housing and Community Investment 
 
 Overall, we contributed 89 million to support affordable housing and community investment needs in the first nine months of 2024, of which 51 million was allocated to the required Affordable Housing Program (AHP). We recognize that funding in addition to the required 10 percent statutory AHP assessments is beneficial to affordable housing and community investment and have voluntarily committed to increase our support in 2024 by at least 50 percent above the statutory AHP level. We estimate that the total targeted voluntary housing contribution for 2024 will be 42 million, of which 38 million has been recognized in non-interest expense on our Statements of Income in the first nine months of 2024. These funds are in addition to the required AHP contributions. These funds were allocated as follows: 
 
 The Carol M. Peterson (CMP) Housing Fund was allocated over 15 million. This program provides grants to cover accessibility and emergency repairs for special needs and elderly homeowners within the Fifth District. 
 The Welcome Home program was funded through the required AHP allocation plus an additional 16 million voluntary contribution in order to help fulfill a record number of requests. This program assists homebuyers with down payments and closing costs. 
 The Rise Up program received 2 million. This program offers grants of 25,000 for down payment, closing cost, and principal reduction assistance for first-generation homebuyers who are looking to purchase their first home in Franklin County, Ohio. 
 The Disaster Reconstruction Program disbursed nearly 1 million for the replacement or repair of homes damaged or destroyed by natural disasters within the Fifth District. 
 The AHP received a voluntary make whole-contribution of 4 million to fully restore the 2024 required AHP contribution due to the effects of voluntary housing contributions, which ultimately reduced reported income before assessments. 
 
 Mission Assets and Activities 
 
 Primary Mission Assets (i.e., principal balances of Advances and mortgage loans held for portfolio) and Supplemental Mission Activities (i.e., Letters of Credit, Mandatory Delivery Contracts and standby bond purchase agreements) are the principal business activities by which we fulfill our mission with direct connections to members and what we refer to as Mission Assets and Activities. We regularly monitor our level of Mission Assets and Activities. One measure we use to assess mission achievement is our Primary Mission Asset ratio, which measures the sum of average Advances and mortgage loans as a percentage of average Consolidated Obligations (adjusted for certain high-quality liquid assets, as permitted by regulation). In the first nine months of 2024, the Primary Mission Asset ratio averaged 76 percent, above the Finance Agency's preferred ratio of 70 percent. In assessing overall mission achievement, we also consider supplemental sources of Mission Assets and Activities, the most significant of which is Letters of Credit issued for the benefit of members.

 (1) Amounts represent principal balances. 
 (2) Amounts represent off-balance sheet commitments. 
 
 Advance principal balances at September 30, 2024 increased 6.3 billion (nine percent) from year-end 2023 given depository members' steady demand for liquidity. However, average principal Advance balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 11.5 billion (13 percent) compared to the same period of 2023. Average Advance balances were higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as member demand increased in March 2023 in response to the turmoil in the banking industry and financial markets. Most of these Advances had matured or were prepaid by the end of 2023. 
 
 Advance balances are often volatile given our members' ability to quickly, normally on the same day, increase or decrease the amount of their Advances. We believe that a key benefit of membership comes from our business model as a wholesale lender GSE, which provides members flexibility in their Advance funding levels and helps support their asset-liability management needs. We act as a reliable source of funding for our members. Our business model is designed to support significant changes in asset levels without having to undergo material changes in staffing, operations, risk practices, or general resource needs. A key reason for this scalability is that our Capital Plan provides for additional capital when Advances grow and the opportunity for us to retire capital when Advances decline, thereby acting to preserve competitive profitability. 
 
 MPP principal balances at September 30, 2024 increased 0.1 billion (one percent) from the year-end 2023 balance. During the first nine months of 2024, we purchased 0.6 billion of mortgage loans, while principal reductions were 0.5 billion. Principal purchases and reductions in the first nine months of 2024 were limited due in large part to the elevated mortgage rate environment. 
 
 Letters of Credit increased 0.6 billion (one percent) from year-end 2023. Letters of Credit balances are primarily used by members to secure public unit deposits. We normally earn fees on Letters of Credit based on the actual average amount of the Letters utilized, which generally is less than the notional amount issued.

Results of Operations 
 
 Our earnings over time reflect the combination of a stable business model and conservative management of risk. Key market driven factors that can cause significant periodic volatility in our profitability include changes in the level of interest rates, changes in spreads between benchmark interest rates and our short-term funding costs, recognition of net amortization from accelerated prepayments of mortgage assets, and fair value adjustments related to the use of derivatives and the associated hedged items. Our profitability may also be affected by our members' overall Advance demand, which is largely influenced by the monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, and general economic conditions. The table below summarizes our results of operations. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2023 Net income 164 170 454 515 668 Return on average equity (ROE) 10.01 10.16 9.46 9.73 9.63 Return on average assets 0.51 0.52 0.49 0.49 0.49 Weighted average dividend rate 9.00 8.00 9.00 7.18 7.60 Dividend payout ratio (1)

 (1) Dividend payout ratio is dividends declared in the period as a percentage of net income. 
 
 Net income decreased 6 million in the three-months comparison period and 61 million in the nine-months comparison period. The decreases in net income were in part due to lower spreads earned on mortgage loans held for portfolio and the increased voluntary housing contributions noted above. Additionally, in the nine-months comparison period, net income was lower due to net market value changes related to interest rate swaps and associated financial instruments carried at fair value. These net market value changes resulted in net losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net gains in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we accrued 51 million for the AHP available to members. In addition to the required AHP assessment, for 2024, we have committed to a minimum of 42 million, or approximately five percent of 2023 income subject to assessments, in voluntary housing contributions to support our Housing and Community Investment programs. In the first nine months of 2024, we allocated 38 million to voluntary housing programs. 
 
 We strive to provide a competitive return on members' capital investment in our company through quarterly dividend payments. In September 2024, we paid stockholders a quarterly dividend at a 9.00 percent annualized rate on their capital investment in our company, which was 3.73 percentage points above the third quarter average SOFR. After we paid our quarterly dividend, retained earnings totaled 1.8 billion on September 30, 2024, an increase of eight percent from year-end 2023. We believe the amount of retained earnings is sufficient to protect against members' impairment risk of their capital stock investment in the FHLB and to provide the opportunity to stabilize or increase future dividends.

 Effect of Interest Rate Environment 
 
 Trends in market interest rates and the resulting shapes of the market yield curves strongly influence our results of operations and profitability because of how they affect members' demand for Mission Assets and Activities, spreads on assets, funding costs and decisions in managing the tradeoffs in our market risk/return profile. The following table presents key market interest rates (obtained from Bloomberg L.P.).

 On September 30, 2024, the target overnight Federal funds rate was in the range of 4.75 to 5.00 percent, a decrease of 50 basis points from the range on December 31, 2023. In November 2024, the Federal Reserve decreased the target overnight Federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 percent. 
 
 Average overnight rates were approximately 40 basis points higher in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, while average mortgage rates were nearly flat. Our earnings from capital increased 4 million in both the three-months and the nine-months comparison periods because of the higher average short-term rates. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024 and throughout 2023, the market risk exposure to changing interest rates was moderate and within policy limits. We believe that longer-term profitability will be competitive, unless interest rates were to increase significantly for a sustained period of time. 
 
 Regulatory and Legislative Developments 
 
 Certain regulatory and legislative actions and developments are summarized in this section. See Part II, Item 7. "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory and Legislative Developments" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I, Item 2. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory and Legislative Developments" in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30,2024, for a description of certain regulatory and legislative developments that occurred prior to the publication of those reports. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management 
 On September 27, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of escalation policies, processes for coordination with members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. We are comparing this advisory bulletin against our current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on our business and operations. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on Federal Home Loan Bank System Climate-Related Risk Management 
 On September 30, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth its expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate, monitor and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the Board of Directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. We are evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on our business and operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for Federal Home Loan Banks 
 On October 3, 2024, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024 to amend the Finance Agency s regulation on capital requirements (Capital Regulation) to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts (IBDAs) in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for our liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to our current business processes. We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on our business and operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Federal Home Loan Bank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management 
 On October 21, 2024, the Finance Agency proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline is February 3, 2025. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of the Finance Agency to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require us to complete and submit background checks to the Finance Agency on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, Community Development Financial Institutions, business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing directors for cause. Other proposed revisions, address, among other things, conflicts of interest policies, covering all employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention. 
 
 While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes to the nomination, election and retention of our Board of Directors. Additional director eligibility requirements and limitations on and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation resulting from the proposed rule could hinder our ability to recruit and retain the talent and expertise that are critical to our ability to satisfy our mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. We continue to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on us.

 (3) Represents the amount of an off-balance sheet commitment. 
 
 Advance principal balances on September 30, 2024 increased 6.3 billion compared to year-end 2023. The increase in Advances resulted primarily from depository members' steady demand for liquidity. The future levels of Advance balances are difficult to predict and depend on many factors, including changes in the level of liquidity in the financial markets, changes in our members' deposit levels compared to loan growth and the general health of the economy. 
 
 Letters of Credit are issued on behalf of members to support certain obligations of members (or members' customers) to third-party beneficiaries. Letters of Credit increased 0.6 billion (one percent) in the first nine months of 2024 as members continue to use them primarily to secure higher levels of public unit deposits. Letters of Credit usually expire without being drawn upon.

 Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio (Mortgage Purchase Program, or MPP) 
 
 MPP balances are influenced by conditions in the housing and mortgage markets, the competitiveness of prices we offer to purchase loans, as well as program features and activity from our largest sellers. We manage purchases and balances at a prudent level relative to capital and total assets to effectively manage market and credit risks consistent with our risk appetite. 
 
 The table below shows principal purchases and collections of loans in the MPP for the first nine months of 2024. All loans acquired in the first nine months of 2024 were conventional loans. 
 (In millions) MPP Principal Balance, December 31, 2023 
 6,960 Principal purchases 563 Principal collections 
 (486) Balance, September 30, 2024 
 7,037 
 
 We closely track the refinancing incentives of our mortgage assets (including loans in the MPP and MBS) because the option for homeowners to change their principal payments normally represents the largest portion of our market risk exposure and can affect MPP balances. MPP principal paydowns equated to a five percent annual constant prepayment rate during the first nine months of 2024 and all of 2023. Mortgage prepayment rates have remained low due to the elevated mortgage rate environment that has persisted over the last several quarters. Likewise, elevated mortgage rates and low housing inventories have substantially eliminated borrower incentive to refinance and have slowed mortgage purchase originations, which in turn contributed to the slow pace of our purchases of new MPP loans in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Overall, MPP yields on new purchases and existing portfolio balances, relative to their market and credit risks, are expected to continue to generate a profitable long-term return.

 (1) The average balance includes the rights or obligations to cash collateral, which are included in the fair value of derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Statements of Condition at period end. 
 
 Liquidity investments are either short-term (primarily overnight), or longer-term investments that consist of U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations. These longer-term investments may be pledged or sold and converted to cash. The ending and average balances of liquidity investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to year-end 2023 as the level of Advances were more stable in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the volatility in Advance balances experienced in 2023. It is normal for liquidity investments to vary by up to several billion dollars on a daily basis. Liquidity investment levels can vary significantly based on changes in the amount of actual Advances, anticipated demand for Advances, regulatory liquidity requirements, the availability of acceptable net spreads, and the number of eligible counterparties that meet our unsecured credit risk criteria. 
 
 Our overarching strategy for balances of MBS is to keep holdings as close as possible to the regulatory maximum. Finance Agency regulations prohibit us from purchasing MBS if our investment in these securities exceeds three times regulatory capital on the day we intend to purchase the securities. The ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.89 on September 30, 2024. The balance of MBS at September 30, 2024 consisted of 18.2 billion of securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (of which 11.4 billion were floating-rate securities), and 1.0 billion of securities issued by Ginnie Mae (which are primarily fixed rate). 
 The table below shows principal purchases and paydowns of our MBS for the first nine months of 2024.

 During the first nine months of 2024, MBS principal paydowns were at a 13 percent annual constant prepayment rate, an increase compared to the 10 percent rate experienced in all of 2023.

 Consolidated Obligations 
 
 We generally fund variable-rate assets with Discount Notes (a portion of which may be swapped), adjustable-rate Bonds, and swapped fixed-rate Bonds because they give us the ability to effectively match the underlying rate reset periods embedded in these assets. Total Consolidated Obligations on September 30, 2024 were 118.6 billion, an increase of 3.2 billion compared to the balance at year-end 2023. The balances and composition of our Consolidated Obligations tend to fluctuate with changes in the balances and composition of our assets. In addition, changes in the amount and composition of our funding may be necessary from time to time to meet the days of positive liquidity and asset/liability maturity funding gap requirements discussed in the "Liquidity Risk" section of "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management." 

Deposits 
 
 Total deposits with us are normally a relatively minor source of funding. Deposits with us are not insured, but are subject to statutory deposit reserve requirements. Total interest-bearing deposits on September 30, 2024 were 1.2 billion, an increase of 0.1 billion compared to the balance at year-end 2023. See the "Liquidity Risk" section of "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management" for additional information. 
 
 Derivatives Hedging Activity and Liquidity 
 
 Our use of derivatives is discussed in the "Effect of the Use of Derivatives on Net Interest Income" and "Non-Interest Income (Loss)" sections in "Results of Operations." Liquidity is discussed in the "Liquidity Risk" section in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 The following tables present capital amounts and capital-to-assets ratios, on both a GAAP and regulatory basis. We consider the regulatory ratio to be a better representation of financial leverage than the GAAP ratio because, although the GAAP ratio treats mandatorily redeemable capital stock as a liability, it protects investors in our debt in the same manner as GAAP capital stock and retained earnings.

 (1) At all times, the FHLB must maintain at least a four percent minimum regulatory capital-to-assets ratio. 
 Our business model is structured to be able to absorb sharp changes in assets because we can execute commensurate changes in liability and capital stock balances. For example, in the first nine months of 2024, we issued 1.9 billion of capital stock to members primarily in support of Advance borrowings, while repurchasing 1.9 billion of excess capital stock no longer supporting Mission Assets and Activities. 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 Excess capital stock is the amount of stock held by a member (or former member) in excess of that institution's minimum stock ownership requirement. Excess capital stock provides a base of capital to manage financial leverage at prudent levels, augments loss protections for bondholders, and may be used by a member to capitalize additional Mission Assets and Activities, before purchasing activity stock. At September 30, 2024, the amount of excess stock, as defined by our Capital Plan, was 0.3 billion, a decrease of 0.3 billion compared to the balance at year-end 2023 due to the repurchase of excess stock noted above.

 (1) Includes monthly recognition of premiums and discounts paid on purchases of mortgage assets, premiums, discounts and concessions paid on Consolidated Obligations and other hedging basis adjustments. 
 (2) This component of net interest rate spread has been segregated to display its relative impact. 
 (3) Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets. 
 
 Net Amortization/Accretion (generally referred to as amortization): Net amortization can become substantial and volatile with changes in interest rates, especially for mortgage assets. For example, when mortgage rates decrease, premium amortization of mortgage assets generally increases, which reduces net interest income. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, mortgage rates were relatively stable and remained at elevated levels, keeping mortgage refinance activity low. 
 
 Prepayment Fees on Advances: Fees received from members for their early repayment of certain Advances, which are included in net interest income, are designed to make us economically indifferent to whether members hold Advances to maturity or repay them before maturity. Advance prepayment fees were minimal in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Other Components of Net Interest Rate Spread: The total other components of net interest rate spread decreased 14 million and 36 million in the three- and nine-months comparison periods, respectively. The net decreases were primarily due to the factors below. 
 
 Nine-Months Comparison 
 Lower average Advance balances- Unfavorable : A decline of 11.4 billion in average Advance balances decreased net interest income by an estimated 34 million. Average Advance balances were higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as member demand increased in March 2023 in response to the turmoil in the banking industry and financial markets. Most of these Advances had matured or were prepaid by the end of 2023. 
 Lower spreads earned on mortgage loans held for portfolio - Unfavorable : Lower spreads on mortgage loans held for portfolio decreased net interest income by an estimated 33 million. Spreads declined primarily because of the maturity of lower-cost debt. 
 Lower average liquidity investments balances- Unfavorable : A decrease of 3.5 billion in average liquidity investments decreased net interest income by an estimated 8 million. 
 Lower spreads earned on liquidity investments- Unfavorable : Lower spreads earned on liquidity investments decreased net interest income by an estimated 5 million. However, the decrease in net interest income was offset by net interest settlements received on related derivatives not receiving hedge accounting, as discussed below. 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 Higher spreads earned on MBS- Favorable: Higher spreads earned on MBS increased net interest income by an estimated 21 million. The higher spreads were driven by widening market spreads, which benefited new MBS purchases. 
 Higher spreads earned on Advances- Favorable: Net interest income earned on Advances increased by an estimated 15 million, primarily driven by a shift in the composition of Advance balances from overnight to longer-term, floating rate, Advance products. 
 Higher average MBS balances- Favorable : An increase of 1.2 billion in average MBS improved net interest income by an estimated 5 million. 
 Lower price alignment amounts paid on derivatives- Favorable: Lower price alignment amounts paid improved net interest income by 5 million. Price alignment amounts approximate the interest that we would pay to counterparties if the variation margin payments for derivative contracts were characterized as collateral pledged to secure outstanding credit exposure.

 Lower spreads earned on Advances - Unfavorable : Lower spreads on Advances decreased net interest income by an estimated 15 million. The decline in spreads was driven by the issuance of higher-cost, longer-term funding. 
 Lower spreads earned on mortgage loans held for portfolio - Unfavorable : Lower spreads on mortgage loans held for portfolio decreased net interest income by an estimated 12 million. Spreads declined primarily because of the maturity of lower-cost debt. 
 Lower spreads earned on liquidity investments- Unfavorable : Lower spreads earned on liquidity investments decreased net interest income by an estimated 7 million. However, the decrease in net interest income was partially offset by net interest settlements received on related derivatives not receiving hedge accounting, as discussed below. 
 Lower price alignment amounts paid on derivatives- Favorable: Lower price alignment amounts paid improved net interest income by 12 million. 
 Higher spreads earned on MBS- Favorable: Higher spreads earned on MBS increased net interest income by an estimated 6 million. The higher spreads were driven by widening market spreads, which benefited new MBS purchases. 
 
 Earnings from Capital: Earnings from capital increased 4 million in both the three-months and the nine-months comparison periods because of higher average short-term rates. 
 
 Average Balance Sheet and Rates 
 The following tables provide average balances and rates for major balance sheet accounts, which determine the changes in net interest rate spreads. Interest amounts and average rates are affected by our use of derivatives and the related accounting elections we make. Interest amounts reported for Advances, MBS, Other investments and Swapped Bonds include gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships. 
 
 In addition, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables and the price alignment amount associated with derivatives in a fair value hedge relationship are included in net interest income and interest rate spread. The price alignment amount approximates the amount of interest that we would receive or pay if the variation margin payments were characterized as collateral pledged to secure outstanding credit exposure on the derivative contracts. However, if the derivatives do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the related net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables and the price alignment amount are recorded in Non-interest income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives and therefore are excluded from the calculation of net interest rate spread. Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest rate spread.

 Effect of the Use of Derivatives on Net Interest Income 
 The following tables show the impact on net interest income from the effect of derivatives and hedging activities. As noted above, gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are recorded in interest income or expense. In addition, for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables and the price alignment amount related to such derivatives are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or expense of the designated hedged item. As such, all the effects on earnings of derivatives qualifying for fair value hedge accounting are reflected in net interest income. The effect on earnings from derivatives not receiving fair value hedge accounting is provided in the Non-Interest Income (Loss) section below.

 We primarily use derivatives to more closely match actual cash flows between assets and liabilities by synthetically converting the fixed interest rates on certain Advances, investments and Consolidated Obligations to adjustable rates tied to an eligible benchmark rate (e.g., the Federal funds effective rate or SOFR). The increases in average short-term interest rates primarily benefited net interest income in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the conversion of certain Advances' and investments' fixed interest rates to adjustable-coupon rates resulted in an increase in the amount of net interest settlements being received. The fluctuation in net interest income from the use of derivatives was acceptable because it enabled us to lower market risk exposure.

Non-Interest Income (Loss) 
 
 Non-interest income (loss) consists of certain gains (losses) on investment securities, derivatives activities, financial instruments held under the fair value option, and other non-interest earning activities. The following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss). The effects of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss) relate only to derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting.

 The decrease in earnings from the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to net market value changes related to Bonds held under the fair value option and the related derivatives hedging them. The net market value changes resulted in net losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net gains in the same period of 2023. We elect the fair value option for certain financial instruments that either do not qualify for hedge accounting or may be at risk for not meeting hedge effectiveness requirements. Because we intend to hold these derivatives and the related financial instruments to maturity, any unrealized gains or losses are expected to reverse in future periods. The impact of the net market value changes was partially offset by net interest settlements being received on interest rate swaps in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 rather than net payments being made in the same period of 2023. The increase in earnings from the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to net market value changes related to interest rate swaps and associated financial instruments carried at fair value. These net market value changes resulted in lower net losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the losses in the same period of 2023. 
 
 In the tables above, "Gains (losses) on trading securities" consist of fixed-rate U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations that have been swapped to a variable rate. Trading securities are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in non-interest income (loss). There are a number of factors that affect the fair value of these securities, such as changes in interest rates, the passage of time, and volatility. By hedging these trading securities, the gains or losses on these trading securities will generally be offset by the gains or losses on the associated interest rate swaps. 
 
 As noted above, the fluctuation in earnings from the use of derivatives was acceptable because it enabled us to lower market risk exposure.

Total non-interest expense increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily as a result of making voluntary housing contributions to help address affordable housing needs and community investment in our District. These voluntary housing contributions are in addition to the 10 percent of earnings that are required to be set aside as AHP assessments.

 Segment Information 
 
 Note 11 of the Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements presents information on our two operating business segments. We manage financial operations and market risk exposure primarily at the macro level, and within the context of the entire balance sheet, rather than exclusively at the level of individual segments. Under this approach, the market risk/return profile of each segment may not match, or possibly even have the same trends as, what would occur if we managed each segment on a stand-alone basis. The tables below summarize each segment's operating results for the periods shown. (Dollars in millions) Traditional Member Finance MPP Total Three Months Ended September 30, 2024

Traditional Member Finance Segment 
 Net income declined in the nine-months comparison largely because of net market value changes related to interest rate swaps and associated financial instruments carried at fair value. The market value changes resulted in net losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net gains in the same period of 2023. Additionally, in the nine months comparison period, net income decreased due to lower average Advance balances. Net income declined in the three-months comparison largely because of lower spreads earned on Advances. Additionally, the lower net income in both comparison periods was partially due to higher voluntary housing contributions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 
 MPP Segment 
 Earnings from the MPP segment decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily because of lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased as the benefits from low cost debt diminished in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, in the three-months comparison period, net income decreased because of net unrealized losses on derivatives related to the MPP segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net gains in the same period of 2023. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Market Value of Equity and Duration of Equity 
 Two key measures of long-term market risk exposure are the sensitivities of the market value of equity and the duration of equity to changes in interest rates and other variables, as presented in the following tables for various instantaneous and permanent interest rate shocks (in basis points). Market value of equity represents the difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities, including off-balance sheet items. The duration of equity provides an estimate of the change in market value of equity to further changes in interest rates. We compiled average results using data for each month end.

 The mortgage assets portfolio normally accounts for almost all market risk exposure because of prepayment volatility that we cannot completely hedge while maintaining sufficient net spreads. The overall market risk exposure to changing interest rates was well within policy limits during the periods presented. At September 30, 2024, market risk exposure to falling and rising rate shocks remained stable. 
 
 Based on the totality of our risk analysis, we expect that overall profitability, defined as the level of ROE compared with short-term market rates, will be competitive over the long term unless interest rates increase by large amounts in a short period of time. Substantial declines in long-term interest rates could decrease income temporarily before reverting to average levels. This temporary reduction in income would be driven by additional recognition of mortgage asset premiums as the incentive for borrowers to refinance results in faster than anticipated repayments of those mortgage assets. However, we believe the mortgage assets portfolio will continue to provide an acceptable risk-adjusted return consistent with our risk appetite philosophy.

 We must hold sufficient capital to protect against exposure to various risks, including market, credit, and operational risks. We regularly conduct a variety of measurements and assessments for capital adequacy. At September 30, 2024, our capital management policy set forth approximately 925 million as the minimum amount of retained earnings we believe is necessary to mitigate impairment risk. 
 
 The following table presents retained earnings. 
 
 (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unrestricted retained earnings 1,008 964 Restricted retained earnings (1) 
 785 694 Total retained earnings 1,793 1,658 
 (1) Pursuant to the FHLBank System's Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement we are not permitted to distribute as dividends. 
 
 As indicated in the table above, our current balance of retained earnings exceeds the policy minimum, which we expect will continue to be the case as we bolster capital adequacy over time by allocating a portion of earnings to the restricted retained earnings account. 
 
 Market Capitalization Ratios 
 We measure two sets of market capitalization ratios. One measures the market value of equity (i.e., total capital) relative to the par value of regulatory capital stock (which is GAAP capital stock and mandatorily redeemable capital stock). The other measures the market value of total capital relative to the book value of total capital, which includes all components of capital, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The measures provide a point-in-time indication of the FHLB's liquidation or franchise value and can also serve as a measure of realized or potential market risk exposure.

 The following table presents the market value of equity to regulatory capital stock (excluding retained earnings) for several interest rate environments.

 (1) Represents a down shock of 200 basis points. 
 (2) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points. 
 
 A base case value below 100 percent could indicate that, in the remote event of an immediate liquidation scenario involving redemption of all capital stock, capital stock may be returned to stockholders at a value below par. This could be due to experiencing risks that lower the market value of capital and/or to having an insufficient amount of retained earnings. In the first nine months of 2024, the market capitalization ratios in the scenarios presented continued to be above our policy requirements. The base case ratio at September 30, 2024 was still well above 100 percent because retained earnings were 37 percent of regulatory capital stock and we maintained stable market risk exposure. 
 
 The following table presents the market value of equity to the book value of total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Base Case (Flat Rates) Scenario (1) 
 95 93 Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Down Shock (1)(2) 
 95 96 Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Up Shock (1)(3) 
 92 89 
 (1) Capital includes total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
 (2) Represents a down shock of 200 basis points. 
 (3) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points. 
 
 A base-case value below 100 percent can indicate that we have realized or could realize risks (especially market risk), such that the market value of total capital owned by stockholders is below the book value of total capital. The base-case ratio at September 30, 2024 indicates that the market value of total capital is 340 million below the book value of total capital. In a scenario in which interest rates increase 200 basis points, the market value of total capital would be 498 million below the book value of total capital. This indicates that in a liquidation scenario, stockholders would not receive the full sum of their total equity ownership in the FHLB. We believe the likelihood of a liquidation scenario is extremely remote. 

Credit Risk 
 
 Overview 
 We believe our risk management practices, discussed below, minimize residual credit risk levels. At September 30, 2024, we had no loan loss reserves or impairment recorded for Credit Services, investments and derivatives and had a minimal amount of credit risk exposure in the MPP. 
 
 Credit Services 
 Overview: The objective of our credit risk management activities is to equalize risk exposure across members and counterparties to a zero level of expected losses. This approach is consistent with our conservative risk management principles and desire to have no residual credit risk related to Advances and Letters of Credit. 
 
 Internal Credit Ratings: We perform credit underwriting of our members and nonmember institutions and assign them an internal credit rating. These credit ratings are based on internal and third-party ratings models, credit analyses and consideration of credit ratings from independent credit rating organizations. Credit ratings are used in conjunction with other measures of credit risk in managing secured credit risk exposure. 
 
 Collateral: We require each member to provide a security interest in eligible collateral before it can undertake any secured borrowing. Eligible loan collateral types include the following: single- and multi-family residential, home equity, commercial 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 real estate, government guaranteed and farm real estate. Eligible security types include those that are government or agency backed, highly-rated municipal securities, and highly-rated private-label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. We have conservative eligibility criteria within each of the above asset types. The estimated value of pledged collateral is discounted in order to offset market, credit, and liquidity risks that may affect the collateral's realizable value in the event it must be liquidated. At September 30, 2024, total eligible pledged collateral of 522.7 billion resulted in total borrowing capacity of 376.0 billion of which 127.7 billion was used to support outstanding Advances and Letters of Credit. Borrowers often pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement to demonstrate access to liquidity and to have the ability to borrow additional amounts in the future. Over-collateralization by one member is not applied to another member. 
 
 Borrowing Capacity/Lendable Value: Lendable Value Rates (LVRs) represent the percent of collateral value net of the discount, or haircut, we apply for purposes of determining borrowing capacity. LVRs are derived using scenario analysis, statistical analysis and management assumptions relating to historical price volatility, inherent credit risks, liquidation costs, and the current credit and economic environment. We apply LVR results to the estimated values of pledged assets. LVRs vary among pledged assets and members based on the member institution type, the financial strength of the member institution, the form of valuation, lien position, the issuer of bond collateral or the quality of securitized assets, the quality of the loan collateral as reflected in the manner in which it was underwritten, and the marketability of the pledged assets. 
 
 MPP 
 Overview: The residual amount of credit risk exposure to loans in the MPP is minimal, based on the same factors described in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Conventional Loan Portfolio Characteristics: At September 30, 2024, the weighted average loan-to-value ratios for conventional loans based on origination values and estimated current values were 73 percent and 47 percent, respectively. The estimated weighted average current loan-to-value ratio at September 30, 2024 decreased one percent from the ratio at December 31, 2023 as overall home values have returned to normal growth rates. 
 
 Credit Performance: The table below provides an analysis of conventional loans delinquent or in the process of foreclosure, along with the national average serious delinquency rate. 
 Conventional Loan Delinquencies (Dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Early stage delinquencies - unpaid principal balance (1) 
 34 32 Serious delinquencies - unpaid principal balance (2) 
 8 10 Early stage delinquency rate (3) 
 0.5 0.5 Serious delinquency rate (4) 
 0.1 0.1 National average serious delinquency rate (5) 
 1.0 1.1 
 (1) Includes conventional loans 30 to 89 days delinquent and not in foreclosure. 
 (2) Includes conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or where the decision of foreclosure or a similar alternative such as pursuit of deed-in-lieu has been reported. 
 (3) Early stage delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio. 
 (4) Serious delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio. 
 (5) National average number of fixed-rate prime and subprime conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure is based on the most recent national delinquency data available. The September 30, 2024 rate is based on June 30, 2024 data. 
 
 Overall, the MPP has experienced a minimal amount of delinquencies, with delinquency rates continuing to be well below national averages. This further supports our view that the portfolio is comprised of high-quality, well-performing loans. 
 
 Credit Enhancements: Conventional mortgage loans are primarily supported against credit losses by some combination of credit enhancements (primary mortgage insurance (PMI) and the Lender Risk Account (LRA)). The LRA is a hold back of a portion of the initial purchase price to cover potential credit losses. Starting after five years from the loan purchase date, we may return the hold back to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) if they manage credit risk to predefined acceptable levels of exposure on the pools of loans they sell to us. As a result, some pools of loans may have sufficient credit enhancements to recapture all losses while other pools of loans may not. The LRA had a balance of 239 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For more information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements. 
 67 

Table of Contents 

Credit Losses: Residual credit risk exposure depends on the actual and potential credit performance of the loans in each pool compared to the pool's equity (on individual loans) and credit enhancements. Our available credit enhancements at September 30, 2024 were able to cover nearly all of the estimated gross credit losses. As a result, estimated credit losses at September 30, 2024 were less than 1 million. Estimated credit losses, after credit enhancements, are accounted for in the allowance for credit losses or as a charge off (i.e., a reduction to the principal of mortgage loans held for portfolio). 
 
 Separate from our allowance for credit losses analysis, we regularly analyze potential adverse scenarios of lifetime credit risk exposure for the loans in the MPP. Even under severely adverse macroeconomic scenarios, we expect credit losses to remain low. 
 
 Investments 
 Liquidity Investments: We hold liquidity investments that can be converted to cash and may be unsecured, guaranteed or supported by the U.S. government, or secured (i.e., collateralized). For unsecured liquidity investments, we invest in the instruments of investment-grade rated institutions, have appropriate and conservative limits on dollar and maturity exposure to each institution, and have strong credit underwriting practices, including active monitoring of credit quality of our counterparties and of the environment in which they operate. In addition, we believe the portion of our liquidity investments for which the investments are secured with collateral (secured resale agreements) present no credit risk exposure to us. Liquidity investments generally fluctuate because of changes in the amount of actual Advances, anticipated demand for Advances, regulatory liquidity requirements, the availability of acceptable net spreads, and the number of eligible counterparties that meet our unsecured credit risk criteria. 
 
 The following table presents the carrying value of liquidity investments outstanding in relation to the counterparties' lowest long-term credit ratings provided by Standard Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. Our internal ratings of these investments may differ from those obtained from Standard Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. The ratings displayed in this table should not be taken as an indication of future ratings.

 Some counterparties used to transact our securities purchased under agreements to resell are not rated by an NRSRO because they are not issuers of debt or are otherwise not required to be rated by an NRSRO. However, each of the counterparties are considered to have the equivalent of at least an investment grade rating based on our internal ratings resulting from a fundamental credit analysis. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are secured by the following types of collateral: U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. agency/GSE obligations, or U.S. agency/GSE MBS. At September 30, 2024, the collateral received had long-term credit ratings of AA, based on the lowest long-term credit ratings of the issuer as provided by Standard Poor s, Moody s, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. The terms of our securities purchased under agreements to resell are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. Additionally, these investments primarily mature overnight.

Our internal ratings of these investments may differ from those obtained from Standard Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. The ratings displayed in this table should not be taken as an indication of future ratings.

 We are prohibited by Finance Agency regulation from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities. Furthermore, we restrict a significant portion of unsecured lending to overnight maturities, which further limits credit risk exposure. 
 
 MBS: 
 
 GSE MBS 
 At September 30, 2024, 18.2 billion of MBS held were GSE securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide credit safeguards by guaranteeing either timely or ultimate payments of principal and interest. We believe that the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lower the chance that they would not be able to fulfill their credit guarantees. 
 
 MBS Issued by Other Government Agencies 
 We also invest in MBS issued and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. These investments totaled 1.0 billion at September 30, 2024. We believe that the strength of Ginnie Mae's guarantee and backing by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us against credit losses on these securities.

 Derivatives 
 Credit Risk Exposure: We mitigate most of the credit risk exposure resulting from derivative transactions through collateralization or use of daily settled contracts. The table below presents the lowest long-term counterparty credit ratings provided by Standard Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services for derivative positions to which we had credit risk exposure at September 30, 2024.

 (2) Represents Mandatory Delivery Contracts. 
 
 Our net exposure to cleared derivatives is primarily associated with the requirement to post initial margin through the clearing agent to the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. We may pledge both cash and non-cash (i.e., securities) as collateral to satisfy this initial margin requirement. However, the use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties. 
 
 Our net exposure to uncleared derivatives is managed to acceptable credit risk levels due to the contractual collateral provisions in these derivatives. 
 
 Although we cannot predict if we will realize credit risk losses from any of our derivatives counterparties, we believe that all of the counterparties will be able to continue making timely interest payments and satisfy the terms and conditions of their derivative contracts with us. As of September 30, 2024, we had a 15 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with a subsidiary of our member, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which also had outstanding credit services with us. We had a de minimis amount of outstanding credit exposure to this counterparty related to interest rate swaps outstanding given the collateral exchanged. 

Liquidity Risk 
 
 Liquidity Overview 
 We strive to be in a liquidity position at all times to meet the borrowing needs of our members and to meet all current and future financial commitments. This objective is achieved by managing liquidity positions to maintain stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds while taking into account market conditions, member demand, and the maturity profile of assets and liabilities. At September 30, 2024, our liquidity position complied with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and internal policies. 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 The FHLBank System's primary source of funds is the sale of Consolidated Obligations in the capital markets. Our ability to obtain funds through the sale of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs depends on the financial market's perception of the riskiness of the Obligations and on prevailing conditions in the capital markets, particularly the short-term capital markets. The System's favorable debt ratings, which take into account our status as a GSE, and our effective risk management practices are instrumental in ensuring stable and satisfactory access to the capital markets. 
 
 We believe our liquidity position, as well as that of the System, continued to be strong during the first nine months of 2024. Our overall ability to effectively fund our operations through debt issuances remained sufficient. Investor demand for System debt was robust in the first nine months of 2024, as investors continued to prefer high-quality money market instruments. We believe there is a low probability of a liquidity or funding crisis in the System that would impair our ability to participate, on a cost-effective basis, in issuances of debt, service outstanding debt, maintain adequate capitalization, or pay competitive dividends. 
 
 The System works collectively to manage and monitor the System-wide liquidity and funding risks. Liquidity risk includes the risk that the System could have difficulty rolling over short-term Obligations when market conditions change, also called refinancing risk. The System has a large reliance on short-term funding; therefore, it has a sharp focus on managing liquidity risk to very low levels. As shown on the unaudited Statements of Cash Flows, in the first nine months of 2024, our portion of the System's debt issuances totaled 81.7 billion for Discount Notes and 92.2 billion for Bonds. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by liquidity preferences and risk aversion, have sought the System s short-term debt, which has resulted in strong demand for debt maturing in one year or less. 
 
 See the Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding maturities of certain financial assets and liabilities which are instrumental in determining the amount of liquidity risk. In addition to contractual maturities, other assumptions regarding cash flows such as estimated prepayments, embedded call optionality, and scheduled amortization are considered when managing liquidity risks. 
 
 Liquidity Management and Regulatory Requirements 
 We manage liquidity risk by ensuring compliance with our regulatory liquidity requirements and regularly monitoring other metrics. 
 
 The Finance Agency establishes the expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity without access to the capital markets for a specified number of days, which was set as a period of between 10 to 30 calendar days in the base case. Under these expectations, all Advance maturities are assumed to renew, unless the Advances relate to former members who are ineligible to borrow new Advances. The maintenance of sufficient liquidity each day is intended to provide additional assurance that we can continue to provide Advances and Letters of Credit to members over an extended period without access to the capital markets. We were in compliance with these liquidity requirements at all times during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 The Finance Agency also provides guidance related to asset/liability maturity funding gap limits. Funding gap metrics measure the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period of time and are expressed as a percentage of total assets. Although subject to change depending on conditions in the financial markets, the current regulatory requirement for funding gaps is between -10 percent to -20 percent for the three-month maturity horizon and is between -25 percent to -35 percent for the one-year maturity horizon. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we operated within those limits. 
 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 To support our member deposits, we also must meet a statutory deposit reserve requirement. The sum of our investments in obligations of the United States, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, and Advances with a final maturity not exceeding five years must equal or exceed the current amount of member deposits. The following table presents the components of this liquidity requirement. 
 
 (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Deposit Reserve Requirement Total Eligible Deposit Reserves 96,183 88,988 Total Member Deposits (1,189) (1,120) Excess Deposit Reserves 94,994 87,868 
 
 Member Concentration Risk 
 
 We regularly assess concentration risks from business activity. We believe the effect on credit risk exposure from borrower concentration is minimal because of our application of credit risk mitigations, specifically credit underwriting of our members and the over-collateralization of borrowings. Advance concentration has a minimal effect on market risk exposure because Advances are largely funded by Consolidated Obligations and interest rate swaps that have similar interest rate characteristics. Furthermore, additional increases in Advance concentration would not materially affect capital adequacy because Advance growth is supported by new purchases of capital stock as required by the Capital Plan. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 
 There were no material developments regarding our operational risk exposure during the first nine months of 2024. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 There have been no material changes in the first nine months of 2024 to our critical accounting estimates. Our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
