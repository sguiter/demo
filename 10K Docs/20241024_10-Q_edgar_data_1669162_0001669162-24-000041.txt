 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any statement that does not directly relate to historical or current fact. These statements may discuss, among others, our future financial performance, our business prospects and strategy, our anticipated financial position, liquidity and capital, dividends and general market and industry conditions. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "outlook," "future," "will," "would," "should," "could," "may," "can have," "prospects" or similar terms. Forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and assumptions about future events, which are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. These statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. Factors that may cause such differences include, without limitation: 
 the possibility that our loss reserves may be inadequate to cover our actual losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; 
 the inherent uncertainty of models resulting in actual losses that are materially different than our estimates; 
 the failure of any of the loss limitations or exclusions we employ, or change in other claims or coverage issues, having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations; 
 the inability to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable prices and on terms that adequately protect us; 
 the possibility that severe weather conditions and catastrophes, including due to climate change, pandemics and similar events adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition; 
 adverse economic factors, including recession, inflation, periods of high unemployment or lower economic activity resulting in the sale of fewer policies than expected or an increase in frequency or severity of claims and premium defaults or both, affecting our growth and profitability; 
 a decline in our financial strength rating adversely affecting the amount of business we write; 
 the potential loss of one or more key executives or an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel adversely affecting our results of operations; 
 our reliance on a select group of brokers; 
 the changing market conditions of our excess and surplus lines ("E S") insurance operations, as well as the cyclical nature of our business, affecting our financial performance; 
 our employees taking excessive risks; 
 the intense competition for business in our industry; 
 the effects of litigation having an adverse effect on our business; 
 the performance of our investment portfolio adversely affecting our financial results;

Table of Contents 

 our credit agreements contain a number of financial and other covenants, the breach of which could result in acceleration of payment of amounts due under our borrowings; 
 extensive regulation adversely affecting our ability to achieve our business objectives or the failure to comply with these regulations adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations; and 
 the other risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Available-for-sale securities in a loss position 
 The Company regularly reviews all its available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses to assess whether the decline in the fair value is deemed to be a credit loss. The Company considers a number of factors in completing its review of credit losses, including the extent to which a security's fair value has been below cost and the financial condition of an issuer. In addition to specific issuer information, the Company also evaluates the current market and interest rate environment. Generally, a decline in a security s value caused by a change in the market or interest rate environment does not constitute a credit loss. 
 For fixed-maturity securities, the Company also considers whether it intends to sell the security or, if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, and its ability to recover all amounts outstanding when contractually due. When assessing whether it intends to sell a fixed-maturity security or, if it is

 At September 30, 2024, the Company held fixed-maturity securities in an unrealized loss position with a total estimated fair value of billion and gross unrealized losses of million. Of these securities, were in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than one year. As discussed above, the Company regularly reviews all fixed-maturity securities within its investment portfolio to determine whether a credit loss has occurred. Based on the Company's review as of September 30, 2024, except for securities previously discussed, unrealized losses were caused by interest rate changes or other market factors and were not credit-specific issues. At September 30, 2024, of the Company s fixed-maturity securities were rated "A-" or better and all of the Company s fixed-maturity securities made expected coupon payments under the contractual terms of the securities.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The discussion and analysis below include certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. 
 The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ended December 31, 2024, or for any other future period. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, and in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 References to the "Company," "Kinsale," "we," "us," and "our" are to Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
 
 Overview 
 Founded in 2009, Kinsale is a specialty insurance company. Kinsale focuses exclusively on the excess and surplus lines ("E S") market in the U.S., where we use our underwriting expertise to write coverages for hard-to-place small business risks and personal lines risks. We market these insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, primarily through a network of independent insurance brokers. 
 We have one reportable segment, our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment, which offers property and casualty ("P C") insurance products through the E S market. For the first nine months of 2024, the percentage breakdown of our gross written premiums was 67.0 casualty and 33.0 property. Our commercial underwriting divisions include commercial property, excess casualty, small business casualty, general casualty, construction, allied health, small business property, products liability, entertainment, energy, professional liability, life sciences, commercial auto, excess professional, environmental, inland marine, health care, management liability, public entity, aviation, ocean marine, product recall, railroad and agribusiness. We also write homeowners' coverage in the personal lines market, which in aggregate represented 2.5 of our gross written premiums in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Gross written premiums 
 Gross written premiums are the amounts received or to be received for insurance policies written or assumed by us during a specific period of time without reduction for policy acquisition costs, reinsurance costs or other deductions. The volume of our gross written premiums in any given period is generally influenced by: 
 New business submissions; 
 Conversion of new business submissions into policies; 
 Renewals of existing policies; and 
 Average size and premium rate of bound policies. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 We earn insurance premiums on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. Our insurance policies generally have a term of one year. Net earned premiums represent the earned portion of our gross written premiums, less that portion of our gross written premiums that is ceded to third-party reinsurers under our reinsurance agreements. 
 Ceded written premiums 
 Ceded written premiums are the amount of gross written premiums ceded to reinsurers. We enter into reinsurance contracts to limit our exposure to potential large losses. Ceded written premiums are earned over the reinsurance contract period in proportion to the period of risk covered. The volume of our ceded written premiums is impacted by the level of our gross written premiums, any decision we make to increase or decrease retention levels and reinstatement premiums, if any. 
 Fee income 
 Fee income includes policy fees charged to insureds and is recognized in earnings when the related premium is written. Policy fees are a flat charge to insureds and fee income is impacted primarily by the volume of business we write. 
 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 
 Losses and loss adjustment expenses are a function of the amount and type of insurance contracts we write and the loss experience associated with the underlying coverage. In general, our losses and loss adjustment expenses are affected by: 
 Frequency of claims associated with the particular types of insurance contracts that we write; 
 Trends in the average size of losses incurred on a particular type of business; 
 Mix of business written by us; 
 Changes in the legal or regulatory environment related to the business we write; 
 Trends in legal defense costs; 
 Wage inflation 
 Social inflation; 
 Inflation in material costs, and 
 Inflation in medical costs. 
 Losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. Losses and loss adjustment expenses may be paid out over a period of years. 
 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses 
 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses include policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Policy acquisition costs are principally composed of the commissions we pay our brokers, net of ceding commissions we receive on business ceded under certain reinsurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs also include underwriting expenses that are directly related to the successful acquisition of those policies which are deferred. The amortization of policy acquisition costs is charged to expense in proportion to premium earned over the policy life. 
 Other underwriting expenses represent the general and administrative expenses of our insurance business such as employment costs, telecommunication and technology costs, and legal and auditing fees.

 Net investment income 
 Net investment income is an important component of our results of operations. We earn investment income on our portfolio of cash and invested assets. Our cash and invested assets are primarily composed of fixed-maturity securities, and may also include cash equivalents, equity securities and short-term investments. The principal factors that influence net investment income are the size of our investment portfolio and the yield on that portfolio. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair value), the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of our invested equity capital combined with premiums we receive from our insureds less payments on policyholder claims. Net investment income also includes rental income and depreciation expense from our real estate investment property, if any. 
 Change in fair value of equity securities 
 Change in fair value of equity securities represents the increase or decrease in the fair value of equity securities held during the period. 
 Net realized investment gains (losses) 
 Net realized investment gains (losses) are a function of the difference between the amount received by us on the sale of a security and the security's amortized cost. 
 Income tax expense 
 Currently, substantially all of our income tax expense relates to federal income taxes. Our insurance subsidiary, Kinsale Insurance Company, is not subject to income taxes in the states in which it operates; however, our non-insurance subsidiaries are subject to state income taxes, but have not generated any material taxable income to date. The amount of income tax expense or benefit recorded in future periods will depend on the jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax laws and regulations in effect. 
 Key metrics 
 We discuss certain key metrics, described below, which we believe provide useful information about our business and the operational factors underlying our financial performance. 
 Underwriting income is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define underwriting income as net income, excluding net investment income, net change in the fair value of equity securities, net realized investment gains and losses, change in allowance for credit losses on investments, interest expense, other income, other expenses and income tax expense. See " Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a reconciliation of net income in accordance with GAAP to underwriting income. 
 Net operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define net operating earnings as net income excluding the net change in the fair value of equity securities, after taxes, net realized investment gains and losses, after taxes and change in allowance for credit losses on investments, after taxes. See " Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a reconciliation of net income in accordance with GAAP to net operating earnings. 
 Loss ratio , expressed as a percentage, is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to the sum of net earned premiums and fee income. 
 Expense ratio , expressed as a percentage, is the ratio of underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses to the sum of net earned premiums and fee income. 
 Combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100 indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.

 Return on equity is net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending total stockholders equity during the period. 
 Operating return on equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define operating return on equity as net operating earnings expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending total stockholders equity during the period. See " Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a reconciliation of net income in accordance with GAAP to net operating earnings. 
 Net retention ratio is the ratio of net written premiums to gross written premiums. 
 Gross investment return is investment income from fixed-maturity and equity securities (and short-term investments, if any), before any deductions for fees and expenses, expressed as a percentage of the average beginning and ending book values of those investments during the period.

 (3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and expense ratio as presented. Calculations of each component may not add due to rounding. 
 Net income was 114.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 76.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 50.1 . The increase in net income for the third quarter of 2024 from the same period last year was primarily due to higher returns on equity investments, continued profitable growth and an increase in investment income driven by higher investment balances and higher interest rates. 
 Underwriting income was 86.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 72.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 19.9 . The corresponding combined ratios were 75.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 74.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in underwriting income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a combination of premium growth and lower relative net commissions offset in part by higher catastrophe losses during the period. 
 Premiums 
 Gross written premiums were 448.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 377.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 70.9 million, or 18.8 . The increase in gross written premiums for the third quarter of 2024 over the same period last year was due to higher submission activity from brokers and a favorable, yet increasingly competitive, pricing environment. The average premium per policy written was approximately 14,500 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to approximately 14,400 in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding our personal lines insurance, which has a relatively low premium per policy written, the average premium per policy written was approximately 15,300 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 15,500 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net written premiums increased by 55.7 million, or 18.9 , to 349.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 294.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net written premiums for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to higher gross written premiums. The net retention ratio was 78.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 77.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net earned premiums increased by 67.3 million, or 23.9 , to 348.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 281.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was directly related to growth in gross written premiums.

 The loss ratio was 56.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 53.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the loss ratio in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was due primarily to higher catastrophe losses incurred and lower relative net favorable development of loss reserves from prior accident years. Net catastrophe losses incurred during the third quarter of 2024 were primarily attributable to Hurricanes Helene, Francine and Beryl and tornadoes in the Midwest. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, prior accident years developed favorably by 10.1 million, of which 14.9 million was attributable to the 2021 through 2023 accident years due to lower emergence of reported losses than expected across most lines of business. This favorable development was offset in part by adverse development largely from the 2017 through 2019 accident years due to construction defect claims that are more exposed to inflation. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, prior accident years developed favorably by 9.1 million, of which 12.0 million was attributable to the 2021 and 2022 accident years due to lower emergence of reported losses than expected across most lines of business. This favorable development was offset in part by adverse development largely from the 2017 through 2019 accident years due primarily to construction defect claims that are more exposed to inflation.

 The expense ratio was 19.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The expense ratio continues to benefit from higher ceding commissions earned under the commercial property quota share treaty as a result of commercial property premium growth. Direct commissions paid as a percent of gross written premiums was 14.7 and 14.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Net investment income increased by 46.4 to 39.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to growth in our investment portfolio generated from the investment of strong operating cash flows and higher interest rates relative to the prior year period. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash equivalents and unrealized gains and losses, had an annualized gross investment return of 4.4 and 4.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 During the third quarter of 2024, the change in fair value of equity securities included changes in unrealized gains related to common stocks of 13.1 million and exchange traded funds ("ETFs") of 6.9 million and unrealized gains related to non-redeemable preferred stock of 0.7 million. The change in the fair value of ETFs and common stocks during the third quarter of 2024 reflected changes in the broader U.S. stock market. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the change in fair value of equity securities included unrealized losses related to ETFs of (3.6) million, unrealized losses related to common stocks of (2.1) million and unrealized gains related to non-redeemable preferred stock of 0.2 million. The change in the fair value of ETFs and common stocks during the third quarter of 2023 reflected changes in the broader U.S. stock market. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, net realized investment gains of 4.3 million primarily related to the sale of a portion of our real estate investment property. 
 Income tax expense 
 Our effective tax rate was 20.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 due to the tax benefits from stock-based compensation, including stock options exercised, and from tax-exempt investment income.

Table of Contents 

 Overview 
 Net income was 305.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 204.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 49.4 . The increase in net income for the first nine months of 2024 over the same period last year was primarily due to a combination of continued profitable growth, higher returns on equity investments, and an increase in investment income driven by both higher investment balances and higher interest rates. 
 Underwriting income was 228.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 185.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 22.9 . The corresponding combined ratios were 77.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 76.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in underwriting income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a combination of premium growth and lower relative net commissions, offset in part by higher catastrophe losses during the period. 
 Premiums 
 Gross written premiums were 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 253.5 million, or 21.6 . The increase in gross written premiums for the first nine months of 2024 over the same period last year was due to higher submission activity from brokers and a favorable, yet increasingly competitive, pricing environment. The average premium per policy written was 15,400 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 15,300 in the first nine months of 2023. Excluding our personal insurance division, which has a relatively low premium per policy written, the average premium per policy written was 16,200 for the first nine months of 2024 and 16,500 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net written premiums increased by 172.9 million, or 18.0 , to 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 958.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net written premiums for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to higher gross written premiums. The net retention ratio was 79.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 81.7 for the same period last year. The decrease in the net retention ratio was primarily due to a higher cession rate on the commercial property quota share treaty effective with the June 2023 renewal, offset in part by an increase in our retention on our casualty treaty effective with the June 2024 renewal. 
 Net earned premiums increased by 215.0 million, or 27.7 , to 990.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 775.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to growth in gross written premiums.

 Loss ratio 
 The following table summarizes the loss ratios for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 in thousands) Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Sum of Earned Premiums and Fee Income Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Sum of Earned Premiums and Fee Income Loss ratio: Current accident year before catastrophe losses

 The loss ratio was 57.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 55.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the loss ratio in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was due primarily to higher catastrophe losses incurred in the period and lower relative net favorable development of loss reserves from prior accident years. Net catastrophe losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to Hurricanes Helene, Francine and Beryl and tornadoes in the Midwest. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, prior accident years developed favorably by 28.1 million, of which 45.6 million was attributable to the 2021 through 2023 accident years due to lower emergence of reported losses than expected across most lines of business. This favorable development was offset in part by adverse development primarily from the 2017 through 2019 accident years due to construction defect claims that are more exposed to inflation and from the 2020 accident year due to a large property claim. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses held at December 31, 2022 developed favorably by 28.6 million, of which 39.0 million was attributable to the 2021 and 2022 accident years due to lower emergence of reported losses than expected across most lines of business. This favorable development was offset in part by adverse development largely from the 2017 through 2019 accident years due primarily to construction defect claims that are more exposed to inflation. 
 Expense ratio 
 The following table summarizes the components of the expense ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Table of Contents 

 The expense ratio was 20.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to lower relative net commissions due to higher ceding commissions earned under the commercial property quota share treaty as a result of commercial property premium growth. Direct commissions paid as a percentage of gross written premiums was 14.7 and 14.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Investing results 
 The following table summarizes net investment income, change in the fair value of equity securities and net realized investment gains (losses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Interest from fixed-maturity securities 105,096 65,376 39,720 Dividends from equity securities 4,331 3,692 639 Cash equivalents and short-term investments 1,726 2,337 (611) Real estate investment income 153 3,565 (3,412) Gross investment income 111,306 74,970 36,336 Investment expenses (2,882) (3,017) 135 Net investment income 108,424 71,953 36,471 Change in fair value of equity securities 41,871 3,796 38,075 Net realized investment gains 6,737 913 5,824 Change in allowance for credit losses on investments 490 (199) 689 Net realized and unrealized investment gains 49,098 4,510 44,588 Total 157,522 76,463 81,059 
 Net investment income increased by 50.7 to 108.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 72.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to growth in our investment portfolio largely generated from the investment of strong operating cash flows and higher interest rates relative to the prior year period. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash equivalents and unrealized gains and losses, had an annualized gross investment return of 4.3 and 3.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the change in fair value of equity securities of 41.9 million included changes in unrealized gains related to common stocks of 25.4 million and ETFs of 13.2 million and changes in unrealized gains related to non-redeemable preferred stock of 3.3 million. The change in the fair value of common stocks and ETFs during the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected higher valuations in the broader U.S. stock market and the change in fair value of preferred stock relates primarily to the disposition of certain preferred stock securities in a loss position. 
 During the first nine months of 2023, the change in fair value of equity securities included unrealized gains related to ETFs and common stocks of 2.7 million and unrealized gains related to non-redeemable preferred stock of 1.1 million. The change in the fair value of ETFs and common stocks during the first nine months of 2023 primarily reflected changes in the broader U.S. stock market. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, net realized investment gains of 6.7 million were primarily related to sales of ETFs due to opportunistic repositioning of our equity portfolio. During the first nine months of 2023, net realized investment gains of 0.9 million included a realized gain of 4.3 million from the sale of a portion of our real estate

 investment property, offset by realized investment losses primarily related to disposing of securities issued by certain banking and financial institutions. 
 We perform quarterly reviews of all available-for-sale securities within our investment portfolio to determine whether the decline in a security's fair value is deemed to be a credit loss. Based on our review, we recorded a reduction to the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 of 0.5 million. See Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding credit losses. 
 Income tax expense 
 Our effective tax rate was 18.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the tax benefits from stock-based compensation, including stock options exercised, and from tax-exempt investment income. 
 Return on equity 
 Our annualized return on equity was 32.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our annualized operating return on equity was 28.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in annualized operating return on equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period was due primarily to higher average stockholders' equity as a result of profitable growth and an increase in the fair value of our fixed income portfolio offset in part by higher net operating earnings. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and uses of funds 
 We are organized as a Delaware holding company with our operations primarily conducted by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Kinsale Insurance Company, which is domiciled in Arkansas. Accordingly, we may receive cash through (1) loans from banks and other third parties, (2) issuance of equity and debt securities, (3) corporate service fees from our insurance subsidiary, (4) payments from our subsidiaries pursuant to our consolidated tax allocation agreement and other transactions, and (5) dividends from our insurance subsidiary. We may use the proceeds from these sources to contribute funds to Kinsale Insurance Company in order to support premium growth, reduce our reliance on reinsurance, pay dividends and taxes and for other business purposes. 
 We receive corporate service fees from Kinsale Insurance Company to reimburse us for most of the operating expenses that we incur. Reimbursement of expenses through corporate service fees is based on the actual costs that we expect to incur with no mark-up above our expected costs. 
 In August 2022, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC that expires in 2025. We can use this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements. 
 In October 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of the Company's common stock. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases, accelerated share repurchase agreements or a combination of methods and pursuant to safe harbors provided by Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases under the share repurchase program will be determined by the Company in its discretion. The stock repurchase program does 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. 
 In July 2022, we entered into a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement"), which provides for the issuance of senior promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to 150.0 million. In September 2023, we amended the Note Purchase Agreement, which increased the authorized aggregate principal amount of senior promissory notes that may be issued thereunder to 200.0 million. 
 Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on July 22, 2022 we issued 125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15 senior promissory notes (the Series A Notes and on September 18, 2023 we issued a 50.0 million aggregate principal amount 6.21 senior promissory note (the "Series B Note"), the proceeds of which were used to fund surplus at Kinsale Insurance Company, refinance indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. See Note 13 for further information regarding the Note Purchase Agreement. 
 In July 2022, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity date to July 22, 2027, and increased the aggregate commitment to 100.0 million, with the option to increase the aggregate commitment by 30.0 million, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes (which may include, without limitation, to fund future growth, to finance working capital needs, to fund capital expenditures, and to refinance, redeem or repay indebtedness). See Note 13 for further information regarding the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 In connection with the share repurchase authorization, in October 2024, the covenants limiting restricted payments under the Note Purchase Agreement and Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were amended. The amendments allow the Company to make restricted payments so long as the aggregate amount of all such restricted payments does not exceed the greater of 300.0 million and 6.5 of the total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. 
 Management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity available both in Kinsale and in its insurance subsidiary, Kinsale Insurance Company, as well as in its other operating subsidiaries, to meet its operating cash needs and obligations and committed capital expenditures for the next 12 months. 
 Cash flows 
 Our most significant source of cash is from premiums received from our insureds, which we generally receive at the beginning of the coverage period. Our most significant cash outflow is for claims that arise when a policyholder incurs an insured loss. Because the payment of claims occurs after the receipt of the premium, often years later, we invest the cash in various investment securities that earn interest and dividends. We also use cash to pay commissions to insurance brokers, as well as to pay for ongoing operating expenses such as salaries, consulting services and taxes. As described under " Reinsurance" below, we use reinsurance to help manage the risk that we take related to the issuance of our policies. We cede, or pay out, part of the premiums we receive to our reinsurers and collect cash back when losses subject to our reinsurance coverage are paid. 
 The timing of our cash flows from operating activities can vary among periods due to the timing by which payments are made or received. Some of our payments and receipts, including loss settlements and subsequent reinsurance receipts, can be significant, so their timing can influence cash flows from operating activities in any given period. Management believes that cash receipts from premiums, proceeds from investment sales and redemptions and investment income are sufficient to cover cash outflows in the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents 

 Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in): Operating activities 
 763,324 648,308 Investing activities (762,100) (616,364) Financing activities 
 (16,227) (25,274) Change in cash and cash equivalents (15,003) 6,670 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 763.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 648.3 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was largely driven by higher premium volume and the timing of claim payments and reinsurance recoveries. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 762.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 616.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 included purchases of fixed-maturity securities of 1.3 billion, which included primarily corporate bonds, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, and to a lesser extent, municipal securities and U.S. Treasuries. During the first nine months of 2024, we received proceeds of 274.2 million from sales of fixed-maturity securities, largely corporate bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, municipal securities, U.S. Treasuries and government agency bonds and 317.4 million from redemptions and maturities of asset- and mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, purchases of equity securities of 115.1 million consisted of common stocks and ETFs. During the first nine months of 2024, we received proceeds of 34.2 million primarily from sales of ETFs and common stocks and, to a lesser extent, calls of non-redeemable preferred stock. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 616.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included purchases of fixed-maturity securities of 947.9 million, which were comprised largely of corporate bonds, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, and to a lesser extent, U.S. Treasuries and municipal securities. During the first nine months of 2023, we received proceeds of 204.4 million from sales of fixed-maturity securities, largely corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and municipal securities and 113.8 million from redemptions and maturities of asset- and mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, purchases of equity securities of 62.0 million consisted of common stocks. During the first nine months of 2023, we received proceeds of 7.5 million from sales of equity securities, primarily ETFs and common stocks. In addition, net sales of short-term investments of 13.1 million consisted of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds. Net cash used in investing activities also included proceeds of 62.0 million from the sale of a portion of our real estate investment property in the third quarter of 2023. 
 During the first nine months of 2024 , cash used in financing reflected dividends paid of 0.45 per common share, or 10.5 million in aggregate. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, payroll taxes withheld and remitted on restricted stock awards were 7.0 million, offset in part by proceeds received from our equity compensation plans of 1.2 million. 
 During the first nine months of 2023 , cash used in financing activities reflected proceeds of 50.0 million from the issuance of the Series B Note on September 18, 2023. Proceeds from the sale of our real estate investment were used to pay down 62.0 million from our Credit Facility. Financing activities also reflected dividends paid of 0.42 per common share, or 9.7 million in aggregate. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, payroll

 taxes withheld and remitted on restricted stock awards were 4.2 million, offset in part by proceeds received from our equity compensation plans of 0.7 million. 
 Reinsurance 
 We enter into reinsurance contracts primarily to limit our exposure to potential large losses. Reinsurance involves an insurance company transferring ("ceding") a portion of its exposure on a risk to another insurer, the reinsurer. The reinsurer assumes the exposure in return for a portion of the premium. Our reinsurance is primarily contracted under quota-share reinsurance treaties and excess of loss treaties. In quota-share reinsurance, the reinsurer agrees to assume a specified percentage of the ceding company's losses arising out of a defined class of business in exchange for a corresponding percentage of premiums, net of a ceding commission. In excess of loss reinsurance, the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of the ceding company's losses, in excess of a specified amount. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the premium payable to the reinsurer is negotiated by the parties based on their assessment of the amount of risk being ceded to the reinsurer because the reinsurer does not share proportionately in the ceding company's losses. 
 We renew our reinsurance treaties annually. During each renewal cycle, there are a number of factors we consider when determining our reinsurance coverage, including (1) plans to change the underlying insurance coverage we offer, (2) trends in loss activity, (3) the level of our capital and surplus, (4) changes in our risk appetite and (5) the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage . 
 To manage our natural catastrophe exposure, we use computer models to analyze the risk of severe losses. We measure exposure to these losses in terms of probable maximum loss ("PML"), which is an estimate of the amount of loss we would expect to meet or exceed once in a given number of years (referred to as the return period). When managing our catastrophe exposure, we generally focus on the 100-year and the 250-year return periods. 
 The following is a summary of our significant reinsurance programs as of September 30, 2024: 
 Line of Business Covered Company Policy Limit Reinsurance Coverage Company Retention Property (1) Up to 10.0 million per occurrence 50 up to 379.8 million per catastrophe 
 50 of commercial property losses Property - catastrophe (2) N/A 175.0 million excess of 60.0 million 60.0 million per catastrophe Primary casualty (3) Up to 10.0 million per occurrence 8.0 million excess of 2.0 million 2.0 million per occurrence Excess casualty (4) Up to 10.0 million per occurrence Variable quota share 2.5 million per occurrence as described in note (4) below 
 (1) Our property quota-share reinsurance reduces the financial impact of property losses on our commercial property, small business property, high value homeowners and inland marine policies up to a loss recovery of 189.9 million for an event. This reinsurance is not applicable to any individual policy with a limit of 2.0 million or less. 
 (2) Our property catastrophe reinsurance reduces the financial impact of a catastrophe event involving multiple claims and policyholders. Our property catastrophe reinsurance includes a reinstatement provision which requires us to pay reinstatement premiums after a loss has occurred in order to preserve coverage. Including the reinstatement of coverage, the maximum aggregate loss recovery limit is 350.0 million. This coverage applies after the coverage provided by the commercial property quota-share treaty.

Table of Contents 

 (3) This reinsurance is not applicable to any individual policy with a per-occurrence limit of 2.0 million or less. 
 (4) For excess casualty policies with a per-occurrence limit higher than 2.5 million, the ceding percentage varies such that the retention is always 2.5 million or less. For example, for a 5.0 million limit excess policy, our retention would be 50 , whereas for a 10.0 million limit excess policy, our retention would be 25 . For policies for which we also write an underlying primary limit, the combined retention on the primary and excess policies would not exceed 2.5 million. This reinsurance is not applicable to any individual policy with a per-occurrence limit of 2.5 million or less. 
 Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. Failure of the reinsurer to honor its obligation could result in losses to us, and therefore, we established an allowance for credit risk based on historical analysis of credit losses for highly rated companies in the insurance industry. In formulating our reinsurance programs, we are selective in our choice of reinsurers and we consider numerous factors, the most important of which are the financial stability of the reinsurer, its history of responding to claims and its overall reputation. In an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of our reinsurers, we review the financial condition of each reinsurer annually. In addition, we continually monitor for rating downgrades involving any of our reinsurers. At September 30, 2024, all reinsurance contracts that our insurance subsidiary was a party to were with companies with A.M. Best ratings of "A-" (Excellent) or better. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded an allowance for credit losses of 0.9 million re lated to our reinsurance balances. 
 Ratings 
 Kinsale Insurance Company has a financial strength rating of "A" (Excellent) with a stable outlook from A.M. Best. A.M. Best assigns ratings to insurance companies, which currently range from "A++" (Superior) to "F" (In Liquidation). "A" (Excellent) is the third highest rating issued by A.M. Best. The "A" (Excellent) rating is assigned to insurers that have, in A.M. Best's opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. This rating is intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer's ability to meet its obligation to policyholders and is not an evaluation directed at investors. 
 The financial strength ratings assigned by A.M. Best have an impact on the ability of the insurance companies to attract and retain agents and brokers and on the risk profiles of the submissions for insurance that the insurance companies receive. The "A" (Excellent) rating obtained by Kinsale Insurance Company is consistent with our business plan and allows us to actively pursue relationships with the agents and brokers identified in our marketing plan. 
 Financial Condition 
 Stockholders' equity 
 At September 30, 2024, total stockholders' equity and tangible stockholders' equity were 1.4 billion compared to total stockholders' equity and tangible stockholders' equity of 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The increases in both total and tangible stockholders' equity over the prior year-end balances were due to profits generated during the period, an increase in the fair value of our fixed-maturity investments and net activity related to stock-based compensation plans, offset in part by payment of dividends. Tangible stockholders equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. See " Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures" for a reconciliation of stockholders' equity in accordance with GAAP to tangible stockholders' equity. 
 Investment portfolio 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash and invested assets of 4.0 billion consisted of fixed-maturity securities, equity securities, cash and cash equivalents and real estate investments. At September 30, 2024, the majority of the investment portfolio was composed of fixed-maturity securities of 3.5 billion that were classified as available-for-

 sale. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of applicable taxes, reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2024, we also held 365.6 million of equity securities, which included ETFs, common stocks and non-redeemable preferred stock, 111.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and 15.0 million of real estate investments. 
 Our fixed-maturity securities, including cash equivalents, had a weighted average duration of 3.1 years and 2.8 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively and an average rating of "AA-" at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost and estimated fair value on fixed-maturity securities were as follows:

 Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 
 Restricted investments 
 In order to conduct business in certain states, we are required to maintain letters of credit or assets on deposit to support state-mandated insurance regulatory requirements and to comply with certain third-party agreements. Assets held on deposit or in trust accounts are primarily in the form of high-grade securities. The fair value of our restricted assets was 3.5 million and 5.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Reconciliation of underwriting income 
 Underwriting income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful in evaluating our underwriting performance without regard to investment income. Underwriting income is defined as net income excluding net investment income, the net change in the fair value of equity securities, net realized investment gains and losses, change in allowance for credit losses on investments, interest expense, other expenses, other income and income tax expense. We use underwriting income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives us and users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance. Underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting income differently.

 Net operating earnings is defined as net income excluding the effects of the net change in the fair value of equity securities, after taxes, net realized investment gains and losses, after taxes, and the change in allowance for credit losses on investments, after taxes. We believe the exclusion of these items provides a useful comparison of our underlying business performance from period to period. Net operating earnings and percentages or calculations using net operating earnings (e.g., diluted operating earnings per share and annualized operating return on equity) are non-GAAP financial measures. Net operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define net operating earnings differently. 
 Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, reconciles to net operating earnings as follows:

 (3) Annualized return on equity is net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders' equity during the period. 
 (4) Annualized operating return on equity is net operating earnings expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders' equity during the period. 
 Reconciliation of tangible stockholders' equity 
 Tangible stockholders equity is defined as total stockholders equity less intangible assets, net of deferred taxes. Our definition of tangible stockholders equity may not be comparable to that of other companies, and it should not be viewed as a substitute for stockholders equity calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use tangible stockholders' equity internally to evaluate the strength of our balance sheet and to compare returns relative to this measure. 
 Stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, reconciles to tangible stockholders' equity as follows:

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We identified the accounting estimates which are critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of our material contingent assets and liabilities, if any. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary market risks have been equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities and interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities. We do not have any material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity risk. 
 There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 The effectiveness of any system of controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations, and, as a result, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be attained.

Refer to Note 15 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 5. Other Information

 Second Amendment to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the "NPA Amendment") with PGIM, Inc. and the other noteholders party thereto; and

 The NPA Amendment amended Paragraph 6H(vi) of the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement by deleting the reference to " 100,000,000" therein and replacing it with "the greater of (x) 300,000,000 and (y) 6.5 of the Total Assets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter". 
 The Credit Agreement Amendment amended Section 6.08(f) of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by deleting the reference to " 100,000,000" therein and replacing it with the greater of (x) 300,000,000 and (y) 6.5 of the Total Assets of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter in its place.
