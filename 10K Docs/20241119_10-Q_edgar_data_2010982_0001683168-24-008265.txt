The Company s financial instruments are
consisted principally of accrued expenses, short term debt, and long term debt. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in
the accompanying balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. 

Tax Effect(Benefit) of operating loss carryforwards 

Tax expense/(benefit) for continuing operations 

The Company has current
net operating loss carryforward of as of September 30, 2024, to offset future taxable income, which expire beginning 2029. 

Deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary
differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates, which
will be in effect when these differences reverse. The components of deferred income tax assets are as follows: 

Valuation allowance 

Net deferred asset 

At September 30, 2024,
the Company provided a 100 valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset because it could not be determined whether it was more
likely than not that the deferred tax asset/(liability) would be realized. 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) was signed into law by the President of the United States. TCJA is a tax reform act that among other things, reduced corporate
tax rates to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be adjusted
for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates in the year of enactment, which is the year in which the, change was signed into law. 

The Company adopted ASC 740-10-25 ASC
740-10-25 with regard to uncertainty income taxes. ASC 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed
or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-25, we may recognize
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination
by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting
in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. We had no material adjustments to our liabilities for unrecognized income
tax benefits according to the provisions of ASC 740-10-25.

had a loss of .). Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. 

The Company is attempting to expand operations
and generate additional revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there
can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further
implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds. The unaudited financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

, whereas the amount due by the Company in the year ended December 31, 2023 was . Funds
were previously advanced by Mr. Rechtman to support the company during a shortage of cash due partially to lower revenues and also the
remaining impact of the Covid pandemic. 

On July 27 th , 2021 Palisades purchased
the assets of Landmark LLC from CorpTech Holding Inc. Mr. Rechtman - our CEO, owns 75 of our Company as well as 90 of CorpTech Holding
Inc., while CorpTech owns 25 of our Company. Palisades paid for this purchase as follows: 25,000,000 shares of Palisades shares and 300,000
promissory Note with terms including no payments for 5 years, 5000 monthly payments for additional 5 years and a balloon payment at the
end of the 10 years for all remaining balance. Palisades may prepay the note with no penalty at any time.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

Palisades Venture, Inc., is a datacenter and computer
storage company based in the US. The Company was formed in 2021 primarily to absorb the assets of Landmark PMG LLC (d/b/a 4Service Cloud
Tech) one of the subsidiaries of CorpTech Holding Inc., for 25,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock and 300,000, through
an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated July 27, 2021. 

The Company is engaged in the cloud computing
segment of the technology sector as well as IT business continuity, disaster recovery and Cyber Security. 

Effective as of July 27, 2021, CorpTech Holding,
Inc., (d/b/a Landmark Properties Management Group, LLC, d/b/a 4Service Cloud Tech) sold all of its rights and assets, through an Asset
Purchase Agreement of its Landmark PMG LLC, D/B/A 4 Service Cloud Tech business to Palisades Venture, Inc. in exchange for 25,000,000
shares of the common stock of Palisades and a 300,000 promissory note. As part of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement by and between
the Company and CorpTech Holding, Inc.; wherein, the Company acquired all the assets and rights to the Landmark PMG LLC, (d/b/a 4Service
Cloud Tech) business for 25,000,000 shares of common stock and a 300,000 promissory note. 

Approximately 25 of the outstanding common stock
of Palisades Venture, Inc. is presently owned by CorpTech Holding, Inc. while 75 is owned by our CEO Orie Rechtman. 

Results of Operations for the three Months Ended September 30, 2024
as compared to the three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

 Revenue for the three months ended September 30 2024 was 43,951 compared
to 37,522 for the period ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of sales 

 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7,937
compared to 22,740 for the period ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating expenses 

 Operating expenses were 32,743 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18,981 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 13,762. The increase
was mainly due to greater overheads for head office costs related to the completion of the S 1 registration statement and audit costs
in addition to the salary of 10,000 paid to Mr. Rechtman, the CEO of the Company. 

Interest expense 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we had interest expense of 8,407 and 7,933 respectively. 

Net Income 

 Net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was (5,136) compared to a loss of (12,133) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower net loss is due to higher
revenue and lower cost of sales, hence a higher profit. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024
as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue 

 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30 2024 was 133,623 compared
to 101,954 for the period ended September 30, 2023. 

17 

Cost of sales 

 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23,639
compared to 31,780 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction of 8,141 was primarily due to reduced costs incurred
for server storage. 

Operating expenses 

 Operating expenses were 79,399 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to 43,844 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 35,555. The increase was mainly
due to greater overheads for head office costs related to the completion of the S 1 registration statement and audit costs, in addition
to the salary of 10,000 paid to Mr. Rechtman, the CEO of the Company. 

Interest expense 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we had interest expense of 24,275 and 23,628 respectively. 

Net Income 

 Net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 6,310 compared to 2,702 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our net income is due to an increase
in revenue and reduced cost of sales during the period. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying unaudited financial statements,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of 422,634 as of September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
had a net income of 6,310. We used 21,842 cash in operating activities. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was
 21,168 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 49,702 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net cash used in financing activities was (24,418)
and (48,806) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Over the next twelve months, we expect our principal
source of liquidity will be raised from the sale of stock, a private placement offering or from an institutional lender. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

18 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We have identified the policies outlined
below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations. The list is not intended to be a comprehensive
list of all our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management's judgment in their application. The impact
and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management's Discussion and Analysis
or Plan of Operation where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Note that our preparation of the financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. 

This item is not applicable as we are
currently considered a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

We maintain disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls 

In designing and evaluating the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally,
in designing disclosure controls and procedures, Company management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

Our CEO has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on the evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in timely alerting
them to material information relating to us that is required to be included in our periodic SEC filings and ensuring that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Such officers also confirmed that there was no
change in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
