We provide a limited lifetime warranty against defects on a majority of the Joybird products, which are a part of our Corporate and Other results. For all our manufacturer warranties, the warranty period begins when the consumer receives our product. We use considerable judgment in making our estimates, and we record differences between our actual and estimated costs when the differences are known.

 Liability-based awards expense (1) 
 ) ) Total stock-based compensation expense 

Restricted Stock . During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we granted shares of restricted stock units to employees and we also have restricted stock awards outstanding from previous grants. We issue restricted stock at no cost to the employees and account for restricted stock awards as equity-based awards because when they vest, they will be settled in common shares. We recognize compensation expense for restricted stock over the vesting period equal to the fair value on the date our Compensation and Talent Oversight Committee of our board of directors approved the awards. Restricted stock awards vest at per year, beginning from the grant date for a term of , with continued vesting upon retirement with respect to the fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 grants. We accelerate the expense for restricted stock granted to retirement-eligible employees over the vesting period, with expense recognized from the grant date through their retirement eligibility date or over the following the grant date, whichever period is longer. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the same period as the forfeitures occur. The weighted-average fair value of the restricted stock that was awarded in the first six months of fiscal 2025 was per share, the market value of our common shares on the date of grant. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units Issued to Directors. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we granted restricted stock units to our non-employee directors. Restricted stock units granted to our non-employee directors are offered at no cost to the directors

 anniversary of the grant date. We account for these restricted stock units as equity-based awards because when they vest, they will be settled in shares of our common stock. We measure and recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The weighted-average fair value of the restricted stock units granted to our non-employee directors in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was per share. 
 
 Performance Shares. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we granted performance-based shares, and we also have performance-based share awards outstanding from previous grants. Payouts of these grants depend on our financial performance and a market-based condition based on the total return our shareholders receive on their investment in our stock relative to returns earned through investments in other public companies ). The performance share opportunity ranges from of the employee s target award if minimum performance requirements are met to a maximum of of the target award based on the attainment of certain financial and shareholder-return goals over a specific performance period, which is generally three fiscal years. 
 
 We account for performance-based shares as equity-based awards because when they vest, they will be settled in common shares. In the event of an employee's termination during the vesting period, the potential right to earn shares under this program is generally forfeited and we have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the same period in which the forfeitures occur. For shares that vest based on our results relative to the performance goals, we expense as compensation cost the fair value of the shares as of the day we granted the awards recognized over the performance period, taking into account the probability that we will satisfy the performance goals. The fair value of each share of the awards we granted in fiscal 2025 that vest based on attaining performance goals was , the market value of our common shares on the date we granted the awards less the dividends we expect to pay before the shares vest. For shares that vest based on market conditions, we use a Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate each share s fair value as of the date of grant. The Monte Carlo valuation model uses multiple simulations to evaluate our probability of achieving various stock price levels to determine our expected performance ranking relative to our peer group. For shares that vest based on market conditions, we expense compensation cost over the vesting period regardless of whether the market condition is ultimately satisfied. Based on the Monte Carlo model, the fair value as of the grant date of the fiscal 2025 grant of shares that vest based on market conditions was . 
 
 Stock Options. We did not grant stock options to employees during the first six months of fiscal 2025, but we have stock options outstanding from grants from prior years. We account for stock options as equity-based awards because when they are exercised, they will be settled in common shares. We recognize compensation expense for stock options over the vesting period equal to the fair value on the date our Compensation and Talent Oversight Committee of our board of directors approved the awards. The vesting period for our stock options ranges from one to , with accelerated vesting upon retirement. The vesting date for retirement-eligible employees is the later of the date they meet the criteria for retirement or after the grant date. We accelerate the expense for options granted to retirement eligible employees over the vesting period, with expense recognized from the grant date through their retirement eligibility date or over the following the grant date, whichever period is longer. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the same period as the forfeitures occur. Granted options outstanding under the former long-term equity award plan remain in effect and have a term of years. We estimated the fair value of the employee stock options granted in prior years at their respective grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires management to make certain assumptions.

 Upholstered Furniture - Includes revenue for upholstered furniture, such as recliners, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, and ottomans. This revenue includes sales to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores (including company-owned stores), operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, other major dealers, independent retailers, and the end consumer. 
 Casegoods Furniture - Includes revenue for casegoods furniture typically found in a bedroom, such as beds, chests, dressers, nightstands and benches; furniture typically found in the dining room, such as dining tables, storage units, and stools; and furniture typically found throughout the home, such as cocktail tables, chairsides, sofa tables, end tables, and entertainment centers. This revenue includes sales to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores (including company-owned stores), independent retailers, and the end consumer. 
 
 Contract Assets and Liabilities. We receive customer deposits from end consumers before we recognize revenue and in some cases, we have the unconditional right to collect the remaining portion of the order price before we fulfill our performance obligation, resulting in a contract asset and a corresponding deferred revenue liability. In our consolidated balance sheet, customer deposits and deferred revenue (collectively, the "contract liabilities") are reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities while contract assets are reported as other current assets.

 operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, our England subsidiary, our casegoods operating segment that sells furniture under brands (American Drew , Hammary , and Kincaid ), and our international operating segment, which includes our international La-Z-Boy wholesale and manufacturing businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into reportable segment because they are economically similar and meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Wholesale segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture, such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas, and imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces. The Wholesale segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. 
 
 Retail Segment . Our Retail segment consists of operating segment comprised of our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores. The Retail segment sells primarily upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other home furnishings accessories, to end consumers through these stores. 
 
 Corporate and Other . Corporate and Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments, including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures upholstered furniture, such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to the end consumer primarily online through its website, www.joybird.com, and through small-format stores in key urban markets. None of the operating segments included in Corporate and Other meet the requirements of reportable segments.

Introduction 
 
 Our Business 
 
 We are the leading global producer of reclining chairs and one of the largest manufacturer/distributors of residential furniture in the United States . The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States . We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products under the La-Z-Boy , England, Kincaid , and Joybird tradenames. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products under the Kincaid , American Drew , Hammary , and Joybird tradenames. 
 
 As of October 26, 2024, our supply chain operations included the following: 
 
 Five major manufacturing locations and 16 distribution centers in the United States and three facilities in Mexico to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy 
 A logistics company that distributes a portion of our products in the United States 
 An upholstery manufacturing business in the United Kingdom and a wholesale sales office that is responsible for distribution of our product in the United Kingdom and Ireland 
 A global trading company in Hong Kong which helps us manage our Asian supply chain by establishing and maintaining relationships with our Asian suppliers, as well as identifying efficiencies and savings opportunities 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced actions intended to drive efficiencies and optimize our manufacturing capacity in our global supply chain operations. As part of this initiative, we made the decision to shift upholstery production from our Ramos, Mexico operations to our other upholstery plants and relocate our cut and sew operations back to Ramos, Mexico, resulting in the permanent closure of our leased cut and sew facility in Parras, Mexico. As a result of these actions, charges were recorded within the Wholesale segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, totaling 3.6 million in cost of sales for severance-related expenses, and 3.0 million in SG A expense for the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets. 
 
 We also participate in two consolidated joint ventures in Thailand that support our international businesses: one that operates a manufacturing facility and another that operates a wholesale sales office. Additionally, we have contracts with several suppliers in Asia to produce products that support our pure import model for casegoods. 
 
 We sell our products through multiple channels: to furniture retailers or distributors in the United States, Canada, and approximately 50 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, directly to consumers through retail stores that we own and operate, and through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com. 
 
 The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 358 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores and 537 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be proprietary. 
 
 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. We own 193 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, while the remainder are independently owned and operated. 
 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. All 537 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations are independently owned and operated. 
 In total, we have approximately 7.6 million square feet of proprietary floor space dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products in the United States and Canada. 
 We also have approximately 2.8 million square feet of floor space outside of the United States and Canada dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products. 
 
 Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with slightly over half of Hammary s sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store network. 
 
 Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 650 outlets and approximately 1.9 million square feet of proprietary floor space. 
 
 In total, our proprietary floor space includes approximately 12.4 million square feet worldwide. 
 
 Joybird sells product primarily online and has 12 small-format stores in key urban markets. 
 
 Century Vision Strategy 
 
 Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term by executing our Century Vision, our strategic plan for growth to our centennial year in 2027, in which we aim to grow sales and market share and strengthen our operating margins. The foundation of our strategic plan is to drive disproportionate growth of our two consumer brands, La-Z-Boy and Joybird, by delivering the transformational power of comfort with a consumer-first approach. We plan to drive growth in the following ways: 
 
 Expanding the La-Z-Boy brand reach 
 
 Leveraging our connection to comfort and reinvigorating our brand with a consumer focus and expanded omni-channel presence. Our strategic initiatives to leverage and reinvigorate our iconic La-Z-Boy brand center on a renewed focus on leveraging the compelling La-Z-Boy comfort message, accelerating our omni-channel offering, and identifying additional consumer-base growth opportunities. We leverage our consumer insights to develop and deliver on-trend upholstered furniture, particularly in the motion and reclining categories. We launched our new brand campaign and marketing platform in fiscal 2024, Long Live the Lazy , with compelling, consumer-inspired messaging designed to increase recognition and consideration of the brand. We expect this new messaging will enhance the appeal of our brand with a broader consumer base. Further, our goal is to connect with consumers along their purchase

 journey through multiple means, whether online or in person. We are driving change throughout our digital platforms to improve the user experience, with a specific focus on the ease with which customers browse through our broad product assortment, customize products to their liking, find stores to make a purchase, or purchase at www.la-z-boy.com. 
 
 Growing our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store network . We expect our strategic initiatives in this area to generate growth in our Retail segment through an increased company-owned store count and in our Wholesale segment as our proprietary distribution network expands. We are not only focused on growing the number of locations, but also on upgrading existing store locations to our new concept designs. We are prioritizing growth of our company-owned Retail business by opportunistically acquiring existing La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores and opening new La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores where we see opportunity for growth, or where we believe we have opportunities for further market penetration. 
 
 Expanding the reach of our wholesale distribution channels. Consumers experience the La-Z-Boy brand in many channels including the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store network and in the La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations, our store-within-a-store format. While consumers increasingly interact with the brand digitally, our consumers demonstrate an affinity for visiting our stores to shop, allowing us to frequently deliver the flagship La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store, or La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio , experience and provide design services. In addition to our branded distribution channels, approximately 2,200 other dealers sell La-Z-Boy products, which include some of the best-known names in the industry, providing us the benefit of multi-channel distribution. We believe there is significant growth potential for our consumer brands through these retail channels. 
 
 Profitably growing the Joybird brand 
 
 Profitably growing the Joybird brand with a digital-first consumer experience. During fiscal 2019, we purchased Joybird, a leading e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture with a direct-to-consumer model. We believe that Joybird is a brand with significant potential and our strategic initiatives in this area focus on fueling profitable growth through an increase in digital marketing spend to drive awareness and customer acquisition, ongoing investments in technology, an expansion of product assortment, and providing additional small-format stores in key urban markets to enhance our consumers' omni-channel experience. 
 
 Enhancing our enterprise capabilities 
 
 Enhancing our enterprise capabilities to support the growth of our consumer brands and enable potential acquisitions for growth. Key to successful growth is ensuring we have the capabilities to support that growth, including an agile supply chain, modern technology for consumers and employees, and by delivering a human-centered employee experience. Through our Century Vision strategic plan, we have several initiatives focused on enhancing these capabilities with a consumer-first focus. 
 
 Reportable Segments 
 
 Our reportable operating segments include the Retail segment and the Wholesale segment. 
 
 Retail Segment . Our Retail segment consists of one operating segment comprised of our 193 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores. The Retail segment sells primarily upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other home furnishings accessories, to end consumers through these stores. 
 
 Wholesale Segment . Our Wholesale segment consists primarily of four operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, our England subsidiary, our casegoods operating segment that sells furniture under three brands (American Drew , Hammary , and Kincaid ), and our international operating segment, which includes our international La-Z-Boy wholesale and manufacturing businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment because they are economically similar and meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Wholesale segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture, such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas, and imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces. The Wholesale segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. 
 
 Corporate and Other . Corporate and Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments, including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures upholstered furniture, such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to the end consumer primarily online through its website, www.joybird.com, and through small-format stores in key urban markets. None of the operating segments included in Corporate and Other meet the requirements of reportable segments. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Compared with Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter 
 
 La-Z-Boy Incorporated Quarter Ended Six Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except percentages) 10/26/2024 10/28/2023 Change 10/26/2024 10/28/2023 Change Sales 521,027 511,435 1.9 1,016,559 993,086 2.4 Operating income 38,772 33,612 15.4 71,142 68,138 4.4 Operating margin 7.4 6.6 7.0 6.9 
 
 Sales 
 
 Consolidated sales increased 9.6 million, or 2 , and 23.5 million, or 2 , in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. The increase during the second quarter was primarily driven by incremental sales resulting from our Retail acquisitions and higher delivered volume in our Joybird business. The first six months of fiscal 2025 further benefited from higher delivered volume to external customers, including the addition of new major wholesale dealers, within our Wholesale segment. 
 
 Operating Margin 
 
 Operating margin, which is calculated as operating income as a percentage of sales, increased 80 basis points and 10 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 
 Gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased 70 basis points and 60 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 
 Changes in our consolidated mix led to a 60 basis point increase in gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, driven by growth of our Retail segment, which has a higher gross margin than our Wholesale segment. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized 3.6 million of severance-related charges as part of our global supply chain optimization initiative, resulting in a comparative gross margin increase of 70 basis points and 40 basis points in second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively. 
 Demand and macroeconomic challenges in our casegoods import business negatively impacted gross margin during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 Lower input costs, led by reduced commodity prices and improved sourcing, drove an increase in gross margin during the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the same period a year ago. The second quarter of fiscal 2024 experienced favorable duty expense, more than offsetting the benefit of lower commodity costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, resulting in a comparative decrease in gross margin. 
 
 SG A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points and increased 50 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 
 Changes in our consolidated mix led to a 60 basis point increase in SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, driven by growth of our Retail segment, which has a higher SG A expense as a percentage of sales than our Wholesale segment. 
 As part of our global supply chain optimization initiative, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 we recognized a 1.2 million gain related to the settlement of our Torre n, Mexico lease obligation on previously impaired long-lived assets and during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized 3.0 million in accelerated

 deprecation related to long-lived assets at our Ramos, Mexico facility. Together, these items resulted in a comparative 60 basis point and 20 basis point decrease in SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively. 
 Reduced marketing expense relative to the prior year, in which we launched our Long Live the Lazy campaign, drove a decrease in SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025. 
 SG A expense as a percentage of sales increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, due to fixed cost deleverage on lower sales in our international wholesale business due to a significant temporary customer disruption. 
 The remaining increase in SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the first six months of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to increased selling expenses and fixed costs resulting from acquisitions of independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries and retail store expansion, both to support our long-term strategy of growing our Retail segment. 
 
 We discuss each segment s results in the following section. 

Retail Segment 
 Quarter Ended Six Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except percentages) 10/26/2024 10/28/2023 Change 10/26/2024 10/28/2023 Change Sales 221,564 214,309 3.4 423,934 422,552 0.3 Operating income 27,897 27,935 (0.1) 48,546 57,199 (15.1) Operating margin 12.6 13.0 11.5 13.5 
 
 Sales 
 
 The Retail segment s sales increased 7.3 million, or 3 , and 1.4 million, or 0.3 , in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. The increase in sales was primarily due to 12.0 million and 22.5 million of incremental sales during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, from our retail store acquisitions that occurred in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, partially offset by a decline in delivered same-store sales. 
 
 Written same-store sales were down 1 and 2 in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to softer industry-wide demand as a result of a challenging macroeconomic environment. Same-store sales include the sales of all currently active stores that have been open and company-owned for each comparable period. 
 
 Operating Margin 
 
 The Retail segment's operating margin decreased 40 basis points and 200 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 
 Gross margin increased 60 basis points and 40 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix towards higher priced products. 
 
 SG A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 100 basis points and 240 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to increased selling expenses and fixed costs resulting from our acquisitions of independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries and retail store expansion, both to support our long-term strategy of growing our Retail segment.

 Sales 
 
 The Wholesale segment s sales decreased 1.1 million, or 0.3 , and increased 16.4 million, or 2 , in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. Over the same periods, intercompany sales from our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment increased 4 and 1 , respectively. Compared with the same periods a year ago, sales volume increased during the first six months of fiscal 2025, reflecting higher delivered volume to external customers, but declined during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, mainly due to a significant temporary customer disruption in our international wholesale business. Additionally, both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 benefited from a favorable shift in product mix toward higher price products. 
 
 Operating Margin 
 
 The Wholesale segment's operating margin increased 80 basis points and 40 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago 
 
 Gross margin decreased 20 basis points and was flat in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 
 Demand and macroeconomic challenges in our casegoods import business, drove a 70 basis point and 50 basis point decrease in gross margin during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 Lower input costs, led by reduced commodity prices and improved sourcing drove a 60 basis point increase in gross margin during the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with the same period a year ago. The second quarter of fiscal 2024 experienced favorable duty expense, more than offsetting the benefit of lower commodity costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, resulting in a comparative 50 basis point decrease in gross margin. 
 An unfavorable shift in channel mix towards external customers, which generally carry products with a lower gross margin than products sold to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries , led to a 60 basis point decrease in gross margin during the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period a year ago. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized 3.6 million in severance-related charges as part of our global supply chain optimization initiative, resulting in comparative gross margin increase of 100 basis points and 50 basis points in second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively. 
 
 SG A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points and 40 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 
 As part of our global supply chain optimization initiative, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 we recognized a 1.2 million gain related to the settlement of our Torre n, Mexico lease obligation on previously impaired long-lived assets and during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recognized 3.0 million in accelerated deprecation related to long-lived assets at our Ramos, Mexico facility. Together, these items resulted in a comparative 80 basis point and 30 basis point decrease in SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively. 
 Reduced marketing expense relative to the prior year, in which we launched our Long Live the Lazy campaign, drove a 70 basis point and 60 basis point decrease in SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively. 
 Partially offsetting the items above, SG A expense as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points and 30 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, from fixed cost deleverage on lower sales in our international wholesale business due to a significant temporary customer disruption.

 Sales 
 
 Corporate and Other sales increased 5.9 million and 4.5 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. The change in sales was primarily led by Joybird sales which increased 6.3 million to 38.7 million and 5.4 million to 73.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, as higher delivered volume more than offset promotional activity. Written sales for Joybird increased 1 and 5 in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 
 
 Intercompany eliminations increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period a year ago due to higher sales from our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment, while intercompany eliminations decreased during the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period a year ago due to lower sales from our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment. 
 
 Operating Loss 
 
 Our Corporate and Other operating loss decreased 2.1 million and 8.1 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to improved Joybird operating margin resulting in breakeven profit, partially offset by lower intercompany operating profit from our global trading company in Hong Kong. The first six months of fiscal 2025 also benefited from favorable intercompany inventory profit elimination adjustments relative to the same period a year ago. 

Non-Operating Income (Expense) 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income was 1.1 million higher in the first six months of 2025, compared with the same period a year ago, primarily driven by higher interest rates. 
 
 Other Income, (Expense), Net 
 
 Other income (expense), net was 1.9 million and 2.5 million of expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively, primarily due to exchange rate losses related to our Thailand manufacturing and wholesale businesses. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective tax rate was 26.3 and 25.9 for the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively, compared with 26.5 for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024. Our effective tax rate varies from the 21 federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under our credit facility. We believe these sources remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, and fulfill other cash requirements for day-to-day operations and capital expenditures, including fiscal 2025 contractual obligations. 
 
 We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 303.1 million at October 26, 2024, compared with 341.1 million at April 27, 2024. In addition, we had investments to enhance our returns on cash of 2.4 million at October 26, 2024, compared with 6.8 million at April 27, 2024.

 The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: Six Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) 10/26/2024 10/28/2023 Cash Flows Provided By (Used For) Net cash provided by operating activities 68,253 56,876 Net cash used for investing activities (45,526) (25,304) Net cash used for financing activities (61,693) (43,883) Exchange rate changes 930 (900) Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (38,036) (13,211) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was 68.3 million, an increase of 11.4 million compared with the same period a year ago. The year over year increase was primarily due to a smaller reduction in customer deposits along with a lower incentive compensation payout in fiscal 2025 relative to the prior year. Our cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to net income, adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by an increase in inventory balances. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, net cash used for investing activities was 45.5 million, an increase of 20.2 million compared with the same period a year ago, primarily due to cash used for acquisitions and increased capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2025 included the following: 
 
 Cash used for capital expenditures in the period was 32.8 million compared with 26.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2024, which was primarily related to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries (new stores and remodels), manufacturing-related investments, and market showroom upgrades. We anticipate that spending on these items will continue in fiscal 2025 with full year fiscal 2025 capital expenditures expected to be in the range of 70 to 80 million. We have no material contractual commitments outstanding for future capital expenditures. 
 Cash used for acquisitions was 17.8 million, primarily related to the acquisition of the Melbourne and Cocoa, Florida and Davenport, Iowa retail businesses. 
 Proceeds from the sale of investments, net of investment purchases, were 4.9 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 On October 15, 2021, we entered into a five-year 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended, the Credit Facility ). Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes. We may increase the size of the facility, either in the form of additional revolving commitments or new term loans, subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in such an increase, up to an additional amount of 100 million. The Credit Facility will mature on October 15, 2026 and provides us the ability to extend the maturity date for two additional one-year periods, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. As of October 26, 2024, we have no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. 
 
 The Credit Facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial covenants requiring a maximum consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as well as customary covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, merge or consolidate, and dispose of certain assets. As of October 26, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the Credit Facility. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash from operations, in addition to our available Credit Facility, will provide adequate liquidity for our business operations over the next 12 months. 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, net cash used for financing activities was 61.7 million, an increase of 17.8 million compared with the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher share repurchases, partially offset by proceeds from exercised stock options. In addition, our cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2024 included holdback payments of 5.0 million for a prior period acquisition. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2025 included the following: 
 
 Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of company stock and we spent 53.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025 to repurchase 1.4 million shares. As of October 26, 2024, 4.3 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to this authorization. With the operating cash flows we anticipate generating in fiscal 2025, we

 expect to continue repurchasing Company stock subject to market conditions and other factors as deemed relevant by our board of directors. 
 Cash paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends was 16.7 million. Our board of directors has sole authority to determine if and when we will declare future dividends and on what terms. We expect the board to continue declaring regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, but it may discontinue doing so at any time at the board's discretion. 
 Proceeds from exercised stock options, net of stock issued and taxes withheld as part of our employee benefit plans, were 9.9 million. 
 
 Exchange Rate Changes 
 
 Due to changes in exchange rates, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by 0.9 million for the six months ended October 26, 2024. These changes impacted our cash balances held in Canada, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. 
 
 Other 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, there were no material changes to the information about our contractual obligations and commitments disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024. We do not expect our continuing compliance with existing federal, state and local statutes dealing with protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or liquidity.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
