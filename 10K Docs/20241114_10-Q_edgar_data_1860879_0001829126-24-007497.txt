Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the Private Placement of an aggregate of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants to Rigel Resource Acquisition Holding LLC (the Sponsor ), to Nathanael Abebe, to Christine Coignard, to Kelvin Dushnisky, to L. Peter O Hagan and to Orion Mine Finance GP III LP Orion GP at a purchase price of per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of , which is described in Note 4. 

On November 9, 2021, the underwriter purchased an additional Units pursuant to a partial exercise of the over-allotment option. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of . Since the underwriter did not exercise the remainder of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited Founder Shares upon the expiration of the over-allotment option in December 2021. The Sponsor transferred Founder Shares to Orion GP (an affiliate of the Sponsor) at the time of the initial closing, in connection with the purchase of private placement warrants by Orion GP. 

As of November 9, 2021, transaction costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees in cash, of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trust Account )) and of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Cash of was held outside of the Trust Account on December 31, 2023 and was available for working capital purposes. 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 9, 2021, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in Trust Account which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. On May 8, 2023, the Sponsor deposited an aggregate of 3,000,000 into the Company s trust account for the Company s public shareholders, representing 0.10 per public share, which enabled the Company to extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial Business Combination by three months, from May 9, 2023 to August 9, 2023. On August 10, 2023, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination or the liquidation of the Company. 

In connection with the Company s
extraordinary general meeting held on August 7, 2023 (the 2023 Special Meeting ), the Company s shareholders
approved a special resolution to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the
 Charter to extend the date by which the Company must either consummate an initial Business Combination or (i) cease
its operations, except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete an initial Business Combination and (ii) redeem all of
the Class A ordinary shares (the Public Shares included as part of the units sold in the Company s initial
public offering, from August 9, 2023 to August 9, 2024 (the 2023 Extension Amendment ). In connection with
the 2023 Extension Amendment, 

On December 28, 2023, the Company amended and
restated: (i) that the First Extension Loan and (ii) the Second Extension Loan (together with the First Extension Loan, the Amended
and Restated Extension Loans to add Orion GP, an affiliate of the Sponsor, as a payee (together with the Sponsor, the Payees ).
The Amended and Restated Extension Loans will be repayable by the Company to the Payees on a pro rata basis based on the amount of the
principal balance each Payee has advanced under the Amended and Restated Extension Loans. The Amended and Restated Extension Loans do
not otherwise materially modify the terms of the First Extension Loan and the Second Extension Loan and are effective as of May 8, 2023
and August 9, 2023, respectively. 

In connection with the Company s extraordinary general meeting
held on August 9, 2024 (the 2024 Special Meeting ), the Company s shareholders approved a special resolution
to amend the Company s Charter to extend the date by which the Company must either (1) consummate an initial Business Combination
or (2) (i) cease its operations, except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete an initial Business Combination, and (ii)
redeem all of the Public Shares, from August 9, 2024 to May 9, 2025 (the 2024 Extension Amendment ). In connection
with the 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 17,440,475 Class A Ordinary Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their
shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 11.40 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of , leaving
approximately in the Company s trust account. See Note 10 for more information. 

Pursuant to the Convertible Promissory Note
dated as of August 9, 2023 (the Second Extension Loan ), the Sponsor has agreed that it will contribute to the
Company as a loan (each loan being referred to herein as a Second Extension Loan Contribution the lesser of 

Pursuant to the Convertible Promissory Note dated
as of August 12, 2024 (the Third Extension Loan ), the Sponsor and Orion GP have agreed that they will contribute to the
Company as a loan (each loan being referred to herein as a Third Extension Loan Contribution of 0.02 for each Public Share
that was not redeemed in connection with the 2024 Special Meeting for each month (or a pro rata portion thereof if less than a month)
until the earlier of 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the value of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined above) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval for a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially 10.20 per Public Share, and such amount will be increased in the case of extensions of the Company s time to consummate our initial Business Combination, as described herein, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . 

If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company receives an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against a proposed Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

The holders of the Founder Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination or to redeem 100 of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment. 

If the Company has not completed a Business Combination by May 9, 2025 (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining Public Shareholders and its Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

The holders of the Founder Shares have agreed to waive the rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares they will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriter has agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit 10.20, or higher in case extensions of the time period to complete the Company s initial Business Combination have been effectuated). 

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) 10.20 per Public Share following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, 10.30 per public share after 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 10.40 per public share after 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, as applicable; and (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.20 per Public Share, due to reductions in the value of trust assets. This liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Going Concern Considerations 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of and working capital deficit of . 

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. In addition, the Company currently has less than 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued to complete a Business Combination transaction. If the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial Business Combination by May 9, 2025, per the mandatory liquidation requirement, the Company must cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company does not have adequate liquidity to sustain operations.

 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. 

Only holders of the Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as otherwise required by law. In connection with our initial Business Combination, we may enter into a shareholders agreement or other arrangements with the shareholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of the Initial Public Offering.

per Public Warrant; 

upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption, or the 30-day redemption period to each warrant holder; and 

if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like) for any 10 trading days within a 20-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to warrant holders. 

If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 

Redemption of Warrants When the Price per Share of Class A Ordinary Share Equals or Exceeds 10.00 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per warrant provided that the holder will be able to exercise their warrants on cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Class A ordinary shares; 

upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption; 

if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like) for any 10 trading days within a 20-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and 

if, and only if, the Private Placement Warrants are also concurrently exchanged at the same price (equal to a number of Class A ordinary shares) as the outstanding public warrants, as described above. 

If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless. 

The Private Placement Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable, except as described above, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 

The Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (including Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. The Private Placement Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment under ASC 815-40 because the Private Warrants include a provision that provides for potential changes to the settlement amounts dependent upon the characteristics of the holder of the Private Placement Warrant and the holder of an instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Public Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment under ASC 815-40 because the Public Warrants include a tender provision that would entitle all of the Public Warrant holders to cash while less than all of the shareholders are entitled to cash. Upon issuance of the derivative Warrants, the Company recorded a liability of on the balance sheet.

NYSE
De-listing 

 As
of November 5, 2024, our Units, Public Shares and Public Warrants have been suspended from the NYSE because we failed to consummate
a business combination within 36 months of its initial public offering, which could have a material adverse effect on the market
prices and liquidity of our securities. 

Section
102.06(e) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires that any acquisition company, such as the Company, must within 36 months of the
effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement, or such shorter period that the company specifies in its constitutive
documents, complete one or more business combinations. The date that is 36 months following the effectiveness of our registration statement
was November 4, 2024. 

On
November 4, 2024, the Company received a notice from the NYSE stating that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined to delist the
listing of our securities pursuant to Sections 102.06e and 802.01B of the NYSE s Listed Company Manual because we failed to

Units, Public Shares and Public Warrants on the NYSE were suspended beginning on November 5, 2024 and the NYSE will apply to delist
the securities upon completion of all applicable procedures. There is no guarantee that an active over-the-counter trading market for our securities will develop or that if such a market does develop,
that it will continue to be active in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the market prices and
liquidity of our securities.

than a month) until the earlier of (i) the date of the extraordinary general meeting held in connection with the shareholder vote to
approve an initial Business Combination and (ii) May 9, 2025. The Third Extension Loan Contributions will be deposited into the
Company s trust account. Loans under the Third Extension Loan can be settled in whole warrants to purchase Class A Ordinary
Shares of the Company at a conversion price equal to 1.00 per warrant. The Third Extension Loan will not bear any interest and will
be repayable by the Company upon the earlier of the date by which the Company must complete an initial Business Combination and the
consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination. The maturity date of the Third Extension Loan may be accelerated
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined therein). Any outstanding principal under the Third Extension Loan may be
prepaid at any time by the Company, at its election and without penalty. On August 13, 2024, September 9, 2024, October 8, 2024 and
November 8, 2024 the Sponsor and Orion GP made aggregate contributions of approximately 142,591, 142,591, and 142,591,
respectively, to the Trust Account under the Third Extension Loan. 

On August 23, 2024, the Company entered into a
Promissory Note (the August 2024 Working Capital Loan with the Sponsor. Pursuant to the August 2024 Working Capital Loan,
the Sponsor has agreed to loan to the Company up to 1,500,000 to be used for working capital purposes. The loans will not bear any interest,
and will be repayable by the Company to the Sponsor upon the earlier of the date by which the Company must complete an initial Business
Combination pursuant to its amended Charter (as amended from time to time) and the consummation of the Company s initial Business
Combination. On September 27, 2024, the Company borrowed 750,000 under the August 2024 Working Capital Loan. As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, there was 750,000 and 0 outstanding under the August 2024 Working Capital Loan, respectively, and is included
in convertible promissory notes - related parties on the accompanying balance sheets. 

The Company has incurred and expects to continue
to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. In addition, the Company currently has less than 12 months from the date
these financial statements were issued to complete a Business Combination transaction. In connection with the Company s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern, the Company does not have adequate liquidity to sustain operations. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to raise capital or to consummate a Business Combination will
be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities
that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements,
established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

31 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, administrative and support services, under which we began incurring fees on November 9, 2021 and will continue to incur fees monthly for up to 24 months until the earlier of the completion of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the Company had accrued legal fees related to the Initial Public Offering and general corporate services of approximately
 990,700 and 491,700, respectively. Approximately 378,300 of these fees will only become due and payable upon the
consummation of a Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the legal fees is in accrued offering
costs of approximately 378,300. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had accrued legal fees related to
the Proposed Business Combination from special counsel of approximately 2,600,000 and 0, respectively. The payment of such fees is
contingent on the successful closing of the Proposed Business Combination. 

The Company entered into a Forward Purchase Agreement on November 4, 2021 with an affiliate of the Sponsor, Orion Mine Finance, which, subject to the approval of Orion Mine Finance s investment committee as well as customary closing conditions, will provide for the purchase of up to 5,000,000 Units, with each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share, at 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, for a purchase price of 10.00 per unit, in a private placement to occur in connection with the closing of a Business Combination. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting estimates and policies: 

A critical accounting estimate to our financial statements include the fair value of the related party convertible notes and the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities. 

Fair value measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and 

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 

In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

32 

Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption 

The Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject
to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity .
Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally
redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder
or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary
equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Company s Class A ordinary shares
feature certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company s control and subject to the occurrence
of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024, the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in the amount
of approximately 82,100,000 are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Company s
condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable shares of Class A ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized a measurement adjustment from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of the redeemable Class A ordinary shares resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. 

Net income (loss) per share 

Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares during the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. The calculation of diluted income per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering, (ii) Private Placement and (iii) embedded conversion feature of the related parties convertible promissory notes, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the two-class method. As a result, diluted earnings (losses) per ordinary share is the same as basic earnings (losses) per ordinary share for the periods presented. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares in the aggregate. 

Convertible Promissory Notes 

The Company accounts for its convertible
promissory notes under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). Under 815-15-25, the election
can be at the inception of a financial instrument to account for the instrument under the fair value option under ASC 825. The
Company has made such election for its convertible promissory notes. Using the fair value option, each convertible promissory note
is required to be recorded at its initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the
estimated fair value of the notes are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the condensed consolidated statements of
operations. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company evaluates its financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC
Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The Company s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as of
the closing date of the Initial Public Offering (November 9, 2021) and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the
fair value reported in the statements of operations. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be
required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The Company has determined the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants
and Forward Purchase Agreement are derivative instruments. As the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the Forward
Purchase Agreement meet the definition of a derivative, the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and Forward Purchase
Agreement are measured at fair value at issuance and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, with
changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the period of change. 

33 

Warrant Instruments 

The Company accounts for the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the Forward Purchase Agreement issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging whereby under that provision, the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the Forward Purchase Agreement do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classifies the warrant instrument as a liability at fair value and adjust the instrument to fair value at each reporting period. This liability will be re-measured at each balance sheet date until the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the Forward Purchase Agreement are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in the Company s statements of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were estimated at issuance using the Monte Carlo simulation model and the modified Black-Scholes model, respectively. The Forward Purchase Agreement was valued using a valuation model that factors in certain assumptions such as the probability of Business Combination, risk free rate and expected period until Business Combination. The valuation models utilize inputs and other assumptions and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period. The Public and Private Warrants will be valued at each reporting period using the publicly available price for the Warrant. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

Emerging Growth Company 

The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

Further, section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts
emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that
is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered
under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company
can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but
any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make
comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an
emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential
differences in accounting standards used. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

34 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed
with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly
Report, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, and noted the
following deficiency that we believe to be a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting: the Company s processes
to ensure its financial statements were properly presented in accordance with GAAP did not operate effectively. Based on this evaluation,
our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, we have instituted plans to remediate the material weakness and will continue to take remediation steps, including devoting additional
resources to the improvement of our internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the accounting treatment for complex financial
instruments. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we are enhancing these processes
to better evaluate our research and understanding of the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our securities and
financial statements. We have also added additional layers of management oversight on the accrual of operating expenses and valuation
of complex financial instruments. As we continue to evaluate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, management will
review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal controls. While we believe these efforts will remediate the material
weakness, the material weakness cannot be considered fully remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient
period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 

If we identify any new material weakness in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than
the circumstances described above, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 

35 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Factors that could cause our actual results to
differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed
with the SEC on September 27, 2024, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A filed with the SEC on July 3, 2024, Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024 and in our other filings with the SEC, including in our preliminary prospectus/proxy statement
included in a Registration Statement on Form F-4 that we will file with the SEC relating to our proposed Business Combination with Aurous.
Any of those factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional
risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
filed with the SEC on September 27, 2024, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A filed with the SEC on July 3, 2024, or our Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024 except as described below. For risk factors related to the proposed Business Combination
with Aurous, see the Risk Factors section set forth in our Registration Statement
on Form F-4 that we will file with the SEC. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in
our future filings with the SEC. 

As of November 5, 2024, our Units, Public
Shares and Public Warrants have been suspended from the NYSE because we failed to consummate a business combination within 36 months of
its initial public offering, which could have a material adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of our securities. 

Section 102.06(e) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual
requires that any acquisition company, such as the Company, must within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering
registration statement, or such shorter period that the company specifies in its constitutive documents, complete one or more business
combinations. The date that is 36 months following the effectiveness of our registration statement was November 4, 2024. 

On November 4, 2024, the Company received a
notice from the NYSE stating that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined to delist the listing of our securities pursuant to
Sections 102.06e and 802.01B of the NYSE s Listed Company Manual because we failed to consummate a business combination within
36 months of its initial public offering. As a result of the determination, trading of our Units, Public Shares and Public Warrants
on the NYSE were suspended beginning on November 5, 2024 and the NYSE will apply to delist the securities upon completion of all
applicable procedures. There is no guarantee that an active over-the-counter trading market for our securities will develop or that if such a market does develop,
that it will continue to be active in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the market prices and liquidity of our securities. 

36 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

There were no unregistered sales of equity securities
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public
Offering, see Part II, Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on September 27, 2024. There has been no material
change in the planned use of the proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as is described in our final prospectus
filed with the SEC on November 8, 2021. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 

(c) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or
officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, 
as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
