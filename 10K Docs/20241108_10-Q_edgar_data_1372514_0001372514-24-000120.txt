 million and Short-term Investments of million, and an Accumulated Deficit of million. Kiora has incurred annual losses and negative cash flows since inception, and future losses are anticipated. However, Management believes that the Company's capital resources as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund the Company's planned operations for at least 12 months after the date that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

 performance obligation identified (i.e., the License), which was transferred to TOI at the execution of the License Agreement and the entire million transaction price was recognized in the first quarter of 2024 upon the satisfaction of the license performance obligations. Variable components of consideration related to development and regulatory milestones, commercial milestones, and royalties will be allocated to the transaction price if and when they occur. When it is probable that including milestones in the transaction price will not result in significant reversals of cumulative revenue in future periods, the Company will recognize the revenue for the milestones immediately since the license performance obligation to which the milestones relate has already been fully satisfied when the change in estimate of the variable consideration occurs. Since the reimbursement for the development activities clearly relates to those activities and are accounted for under ASC 808, the Company will recognize those amounts that are due from TOI as contra-R D expense. 

See Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

As of August 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the KIO-201 assets was less than their carrying value due to the strategic decision to cease all future development. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment loss of million which is shown in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the line In-process R D Impairment. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was million and million,

 shares. 
 No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share received a cash payment in lieu thereof. The reverse stock split affected all stockholders proportionately and did not affect any stockholder s percentage ownership of the Company s common stock (except to the extent that the reverse stock split results in stockholders owning fractional shares). As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock as of June 11, 2024 decreased from (pre-split) shares to (post-split) shares. 
 All share and per share amounts in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. While the number of warrants outstanding did not change, the underlying shares did and are presented reflecting the split. The Company s common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened on June 11, 2024 .

 The Company reviews its investments each quarter to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible other-than-temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, any changes to the underlying credit risk of the investment, and the Company s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. The unrealized losses in the Company s investments were caused by changes in interest rates resulting from changing economic conditions, and not from a decline in credit of their underlying issuers. The Company may be required to sell these investments prior to maturity to implement management strategies, however, it is not likely that the Company will sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As such, the Company has classified these losses as temporary in nature.

 In connection with historical acquisitions, additional consideration may be owed by the Company related to the achievement of certain milestones and such contingent consideration payments are required by U.S. GAAP to be presented at fair value. 
 Total Contingent Consideration 
 The Company initially values contingent consideration related to business combinations using a probability-weighted calculation of potential payment scenarios discounted at rates reflective of the risks associated with the expected future cash flows for certain milestones. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration include projected financial information, market data and the probability and timing of achieving the specific milestones.

 Significant changes in these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value. The contingent consideration reported in the above table is adjusted quarterly based upon the passage of time or the anticipated success or failure of achieving certain milestones. The change in fair value of contingent consideration of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the reversal of the liability related to KIO-201 of approximately million resulting from the strategic decision to cease continued development or partnership leading to commercialization. The change in fair value of contingent consideration of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by additional disease indications for KIO-301 that were added in Q3 2023 when assessing the probabilities of success in achieving certain milestones. The change in fair value of contingent consideration is recorded within operating expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive income (loss). 
 The Company records in-process R D projects acquired in asset acquisitions that have not reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use at estimated fair value. For in-process R D projects acquired in business combinations, the Company capitalizes the in-process R D project as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and evaluates this asset annually for impairment until the R D process has been completed. Once the R D process is complete, the Company amortizes the R D asset over its remaining useful life. 
 ASC 350 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, the entity must calculate the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount exceeds fair value. If an entity concludes that there is a less than 50 percent likelihood that the asset is impaired, no further action is required. An indefinite-lived intangible asset should be tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If such events or changes have occurred, a quantitative assessment is required. 
 
 If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or determines from its qualitative assessment that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired, a quantitative impairment test should be performed. The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset with the asset s carrying amount. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to the difference in accordance with ASC 350-30-35-19. 
 The Company values in-process R D related to asset acquisitions using the Income Approach which measures the value of an asset by the present value of its future economic benefits. These benefits can include interest and principal payments, earnings, cost savings, tax deductions, or proceeds from its disposition. Value indications are developed by discounting expected cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of funds, the expected rate of inflation, and risks associated with the particular investment. The selected discount rate is generally based on rates of return available from alternative investments of similar type and quality.

The public offering price of per share of common stock, Class C Warrant and Class D Warrant, and per share of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock, 101 Class C Warrants and 101 Class D Warrants, resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately million net of underwriting discount and commissions of million and other expenses of million.

 Each Class C Warrant and Class D Warrant is exercisable at a price per share of common stock of . The Class C Warrants will expire on June 6, 2028 and the Class D Warrants expired on June 6, 2024. The exercise prices of the warrants are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of recapitalization events, stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications, reorganizations or similar events affecting the Company s common stock. In addition, on August 7, 2023, the first business day after the th calendar day immediately following the initial exercise day, the exercise price of the warrants was reduced to per share pursuant to the reset provision which stated that the warrants would be reduced to the lesser of (i) the exercise price then in effect and (ii) of the average of the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock for the five ) trading day period immediately prior to the reset date. In accordance with ASU 2021-04, the warrant reset of the exercise price was evaluated as a modification of equity-classified written call options. Modifications or exchanges that are not related to debt or equity financings, compensation for goods or services, or other exchange transactions within the scope of other guidance should be recognized as a dividend consistent with ASC 815-40-35-17(d). The dividend amount is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified or exchanged instrument over the fair value of that instrument immediately before it is modified or exchanged in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-16. The Company considered the guidance in paragraphs 815-40-35-14 through 35-17 and determined that the circumstances of the warrant modification indicate that the modification is executed separate from a new equity offering, debt origination or debt modification. As such, on August 7, 2023, the date on which the modification became effective, the incremental change in the fair value of the outstanding warrants was recognized as a deemed dividend totaling million that increases net loss attributable to common stockholders in accordance with paragraph 815-40-35-17(d) and ASC 260-10-45-15. During November 2023, shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of Class C Warrants and shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of Class D Warrants for thousand in aggregate exercise proceeds. In February 2024, shares of common stock were issued upon exercise of Class C Warrants at per share for aggregate proceeds of approximately million. Additionally, shares of common stock were issued upon exercise of Class D Warrants at per share for aggregate proceeds of approximately million. During June 2024, shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of Class D Warrants at per share for aggregate proceeds of approximately million. 
 On February 3, 2023, the Company completed a private placement with Lincoln Park Capital, LLC ("Lincoln Park") for shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock. The total net proceeds from the private placement were approximately million. The warrants have an exercise price of per share, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the warrants, and became exercisable on the six-month anniversary of the closing date. The warrants are exercisable for from the issuance date. 
 On February 3, 2023, the Company also entered into a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has agreed to purchase from the Company up to an aggregate of million of common stock (subject to certain limitations), from time to time and at the Company's sole discretion over the term of the purchase agreement. On February 22, 2023, the Company completed its first issuance under this agreement for a total of shares sold to Lincoln Park for proceeds of million. In April 2023, the Company completed additional issuances for a total of shares sold to Lincoln Park for proceeds of million. On January 31, 2024, the Company terminated the purchase agreement with Lincoln Park. 
 During February 2023, shares were issued upon the exercise of inducement warrants issued in November 2022.

 Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of stock options, warrants, and preferred stock and are calculated using the treasury stock method, which assumes the repurchase of common shares at the average market price during the period. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants will have a dilutive effect when the average price of common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of options or warrants. Common equivalent shares do not qualify as participating securities. In periods where the Company records a net loss, unvested restricted common stock and potential common stock equivalents are not included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

 Executive Summary 
 We are a specialty clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing products for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. 
 KIO-301 is initially focused on patients with later stages of disease progression due to Retinitis Pigmentosa (any and all sub-forms). KIO-301 is a potential vision-restoring small molecule that acts as a photoswitch specifically designed to restore vision in patients with inherited and age-related degenerative retinal diseases. The molecule is specifically designed to restore the eyes ability to perceive and interpret light in visually impaired patients. It selectively enters viable downstream retinal ganglion cells (no longer receiving electrical input due to degenerated rods and cones) and is intended to turn them into light sensing cells, capable of signaling the brain as to the presence or absence of light. On March 17, 2022, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation by the United States U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient API in KIO-301. In July 2024, we were granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the European Medicines Agency for KIO-301 for the treatment of non-syndromic, rod-dominant retinal dystrophies, which includes diseases like retinitis pigmentosa, choroideremia, Stargardt disease and others. In September 2024, the European Medicines Agency expanded out Orphan Medicinal Product Designation to also include syndromic, rod-dominant retinal dystrophies that includes diseases like Usher's syndrome, which has non-ocular aspects of diseases in addition to retinal involvement. 
 KIO-301 (formerly known as B-203) was acquired through the Bayon Therapeutics, Inc. ("Bayon") transaction that closed October 21, 2021. We initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial (ABACUS-1) in the third quarter of 2022. Topline data from this trial was presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology annual meeting in November 2023. The complete data set was presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology ("ARVO") annual conference in May 2024 highlighting improvements in visual acuity, visual field and functional vision among clinical trial participants relative to baseline. In October 2024, we announced the receipt of regulatory approval to initiate the Phase 2 trial of KIO-301 (ABACUS-2) and we anticipate enrolling our first patient in 1H 2025. 
 In January 2024, we entered into a strategic development and commercialization agreement ("License Agreement") with Th a Open Innovation ("TOI"), a sister company of the global ophthalmic specialty company Laboratoires Th a ("Th a"). Under the agreement, Kiora granted TOI exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights, excluding Asia, to KIO-301 for the treatment of degenerative retinal diseases. In exchange, Kiora received an upfront, payment of 16 million; up to 285 million upon achievement of pre-specified clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestones; tiered royalties of up to low 20 on net sales; and reimbursement of all KIO-301 research and development expenses moving forward from the date of the execution of the License Agreement. 
 Based on results of ABACUS-1, we have the opportunity to expand development of KIO-301 to treat patients with late stages of Choroideremia and Stargardt disease. These diseases have a similar underlying late-stage pathology as Retinitis Pigmentosa, hence the mechanism of action of KIO-301 could potentially provide a similar benefit to these patients.

Table of Contents 

 We are also planning to develop KIO-104 for the treatment of retinal inflammatory diseases including Posterior Non-Infectious Uveitis, a rare T cell-mediated, intraocular inflammatory disease and diabetic macular edema. KIO-104 is a novel and potent small molecule inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ("DHODH"), formulated for intravitreal delivery and ideally suited to suppress overactive T-cell activity to treat the underlying condition. Data from a previous Phase 1/2a study in patients with Posterior Non-Infectious Uveitis, reported in October 2022, showed that a single injection of KIO-104 decreased intraocular inflammation and improved visual acuity significantly for the duration of the study. Further, there is evidence of reduced cystoid macular edema from baseline. We are currently designing a Phase 2 clinical trial in retinal inflammation, expected to initiate in early 2025. 
 We have an additional asset, KIO-101, that we are currently seeking to partner. KIO-101 is based on the same molecule as KIO-104, however formulated for topical, eye drop delivery. 
 Throughout our history we have not generated significant revenue; however in January 2024 we entered into the License Agreement with TOI, whereby we recognized 16 million in collaboration revenue related to the upfront payment. We have never been profitable and from inception through September 30, 2024, our losses from operations have aggregated 139.2 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses in order to create an infrastructure to support their commercialization including sales, marketing, and distribution functions. 
 We will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. We will seek to fund our operations through a combination of public or private sales of equity, debt financings, license and development agreements, non-dilutive grants and other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. Although historically we have been successful at raising capital, most recently raising net proceeds of approximately 13.8 million in a private placement offering that closed on February 5, 2024, additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to Kiora, if at all. We do not know if any future offerings will succeed. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. Kiora has incurred losses and negative cash flows since inception, and future losses are anticipated. However, based on the cash on hand and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 of approximately 5.6 million and 23.4 million, respectively, we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund currently planned operations into 2027. 
 
 Recent Developments

 New Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue has been derived from payments received under our license and research collaboration agreements, which for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represented an upfront payment from our collaboration agreement with TOI. In the future, we anticipate our revenue to include additional milestone payments under our current and/or future collaboration agreements. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products unless and until such time that our product candidates have advanced through clinical development and regulatory approval, if ever. We expect that any revenue we generate, if at all, will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments relating to such services and milestones and the extent to which any of our products are approved and successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete clinical development of product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our ability to generate future revenues and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.

 (3,413,326) (5,762,941) 2,349,615 
 General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease of 34.8 thousand was driven by a decrease in proxy related public company expenses of 52.6 thousand, a reduction in D O insurance premiums of 40.0 thousand, and reduced IT related costs of 32.0 thousand, partially offset by increased tax services of 75.0 thousand including a Section 382 analysis and an increase in personnel related costs of 0.1 million. 
 Research and Development Expenses. The increase of 0.2 million was primarily due to an increase in CMC for KIO-301 and KIO-104 of 1.0 million, an increase in personnel related costs of 0.2 million, 0.1 million of travel and a decrease of 0.5 million for credits expected from Australian and Austrian government programs related to research and development activities, offset by an increase in KIO-301 related expenses of 0.9 million resulting from the expense reimbursement related to the strategic development and commercialization agreement with TOI, a reduction in clinical related expenses for the KIO-301 RP phase 1b trial conducted in 2023 of 0.2 million and the KIO-101 Ocular Presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis + clinical trial activity 0.3 million, and fees associated with the settlement agreement with Mediolanum of 0.1 million. 
 In-Process R D Impairment. The increase of 0.1 million was primarily due to the full impairment of KIO-201. This was caused by a strategic decision to stop pursuing partnership opportunities for this program which we had been pursuing since August 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The decrease of 2.6 million was primarily driven by the decrease in the fair value of KIO-201 of approximately 0.8 million resulting from the strategic decision to cease further development of the asset and out-licensing opportunities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, additional disease indications for KIO-301 were added when assessing the probabilities of success of achieving certain milestones contributing 1.5 million of expense. 
 Other Income, Net. The increase of 33.3 thousand was primarily due to increased net interest income and accrued interest amortization of approximately 0.3 million resulting from funds raised in the first quarter of 2024 offset by the write off of an intangible asset related to the SentrX Agreement of 0.1 million, unrealized losses related to foreign currency activity of 0.1 million, and reimbursement in 2023 related to an insurance claim of 85.0 thousand.

 Comparison of nine months ended, September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following table summarizes the results of our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 2024 
 2023 
 Change Revenue: 
 Collaboration Revenue 
 16,000,000 16,000,000 Grant Revenue

 7,818,235 (10,245,290) 18,063,525 
 Revenue . The increase of 16.0 million was attributable to the revenue recognized from the upfront payment pursuant the strategic development and commercialization agreement with TOI and from a grant from the Choroideremia Research Foundation. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. The increase of 0.4 million was driven by increased professional fees of 0.4 million related primarily to accounting and tax advisory related to the strategic development and commercialization agreement with TOI. Additionally, personnel related costs increased 0.2 million related to higher salary and bonus expenses, offset by a reduction in D O insurance premiums of 0.1 million and rent expense costs related to the closure of the Salt Lake City location of 0.1 million. 
 Research and Development Expenses. The increase of 0.8 million was primarily due to CMC expenses of 1.6 million, UC licensing payments of 0.7 million, salaries and benefits of 0.2 million, and travel costs of 0.1 million, offset by clinical trial and regulatory activities of 0.8 million, a net reduction in expenses of 1.0 million resulting from a decrease in research tax credits expected from Australian and Austrian government programs of 1.2 million and an increase in expense reimbursement related to the strategic development and commercialization agreement with TOI of 2.2 million. 
 In-Process R D Impairment. The increase of 0.1 million was primarily due to the full impairment of KIO-201. This resulted from a strategic decision to stop pursuing partnership opportunities for this program which the Company had been pursuing since August 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The decrease of 2.9 million was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of KIO-201 of approximately 0.8 million resulting from the strategic decision to cease further development of the asset and out-licensing opportunities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, additional disease indications for KIO-301 were added when assessing the probabilities of success in achieving certain milestones contributing 1.5 million of expense. Lastly, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the KIO-301 Phase 1b milestone payment was made totaling 0.5 million. 
 Other Income, Net. The increase of 0.5 million was primarily due to increased net interest income of approximately 0.4 million resulting from funds raised in Q1 2024 and accrued interest on short term marketable securities of 0.1 million.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal liquidity needs have historically been for acquisitions, working capital, research and development, and capital expenditures. While we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund currently planned operations into 2027, we will need additional financing to support our future operations as we develop and work toward the commercialization of new products. We will seek to fund our operations through a combination of public or private sales of equity, debt financings, license and development agreements, non-dilutive grants and other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. 
 If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, or making capital expenditures. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, future revenue streams or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Although historically we have been successful at raising capital, most recently raising net proceeds of approximately 13.8 million in a private placement offering that closed on February 5, 2024, additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We do not know if any future offerings will succeed. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We have incurred losses and negative cash flows since inception, and future losses are anticipated. However, based on the cash on hand and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 of approximately 5.6 million and 23.4 million, respectively, we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund currently planned operations into 2027. 
 
 Information Regarding Cash Flows 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 5.6 million and restricted cash totaling 4.5 thousand for a total of 5.6 million compared to 2.5 million at December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth the primary uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities 
 10,811,473 (6,975,610) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (23,145,294) Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 15,498,155 6,452,487 
 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 17.8 million primarily due to the collaboration revenue recognized from the TOI agreement and the timing of research and development activities. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used for investing activities increased 23.1 million primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities. The increase in cash from financing activities is due to receiving net proceeds of approximately 13.8 million in a private offering that closed on February 5, 2024 and proceeds of 1.7 million from warrant exercises, compared to net proceeds of approximately 0.4 million from equity line of credit share purchases and 5.6 million from a public offering that closed on June 6, 2023.

 Funding Requirements and Other Liquidity Matters 
 Our product pipeline is still in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we: 
 seek partnerships for our KIO-101 product to continue its development activities; 
 seek marketing approval for our KIO-301 product outside of the territory already partnered with TOI; 
 seek marketing approval for our KIO-104 product or any other products that we successfully develop; 
 establish a sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our KIO-301 product outside of the territory already partnered with TOI; 
 establish a sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our KIO-104 product, if approved; and 
 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and future commercialization efforts. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, grants and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, including our KIO-301 (outside of the territory already partnered with TOI), KIO-101, and KIO-104 products, on terms that may not be favorable to us. We have currently paused development work on KIO-101 and are seeking partnership for any further development of those programs. For our active programs, if we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market KIO-301 outside of the territory already partnered with TOI and KIO-104 products, or any other products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Based on our cash on hand and short-term investments at September 30, 2024, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund planned operations into 2027. However, the acceleration or reduction of cash outflows by management can significantly impact the timing for raising additional capital to complete development of our products. To continue development, we will need to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financing, grants and other arrangements. Although historically we have been successful at raising capital, additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We do not know if any future offerings will succeed. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that management will be successful in these endeavors. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
