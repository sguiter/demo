AEP PLC was the buyer for one of the 363 Sales, pursuant to a credit bid of million for a portion of its senior secured debtor-in-possession loan to Auto Plus. The last of the 363 Sales closed on June 12, 2023. The proceeds of the 363 Sales have been and will continue to be used to satisfy obligations to Auto Plus creditors. On June 16, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving Auto Plus Third Amended Combined Disclosure Statement and Joint Plan of Liquidation (the Bankruptcy Plan ). The effective date of the Bankruptcy Plan occurred on October 6, 2023. The Bankruptcy Plan provides for the orderly liquidation of Auto Plus and distribution of its assets. As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company determined that it no longer controls Auto Plus under the criteria set out in FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation and deconsolidated its investment effective January 31, 2023. In order to deconsolidate Auto Plus, we removed the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of Auto Plus as of January 31, 2023 and recorded our investment in Auto Plus at resulting in a non-cash charge of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. billion and billion, respectively, representing approximately and of the Investment Funds assets under management as of each respective date.

Under the manager agreement, Brett Icahn serves as the portfolio manager of a designated portfolio of assets within the Investment Funds over a term, subject to veto rights by our Investment segment and Carl C.

Energy RFS Disputes - CVR Energy s obligated-party subsidiaries are subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard RFS implemented by the EPA which requires refiners to either blend renewable fuels into their transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, in lieu of blending, in an amount equal to the renewable volume obligation RVO for the applicable compliance year. CVR Energy s obligated-party subsidiaries are not able to blend the substantial majority of their transportation fuels and, unless their obligations are waived or exempted by the EPA, must either purchase RINs on the open market or obtain waiver credits for cellulosic biofuels in order to comply with the RFS. CVR Energy s obligated-party subsidiaries also purchase RINs generated from its renewable diesel operations to partially satisfy their RFS obligations. One of CVR Energy s obligated-party subsidiaries, Wynnewood Refining Company, LLC WRC ), qualifies as a small refinery defined under the RFS as a refinery with an average aggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year no greater than 75,000 barrels, which enables WRC to seek small refinery exemptions SREs under the RFS should it be able to establish it suffered disproportionate economic hardship. WRC has submitted SRE petitions for the 2017 through 2024 compliance periods, which petitions are in various stages of review by the EPA and/or various courts . Regarding WRC s SRE petitions for the 2017 to 2021 compliance periods which, together with the SRE petitions from certain other small refineries, had been denied by the EPA in 2022 (the 2022 Denials ), the EPA has yet to act on those petitions after the EPA s denials were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Fifth Circuit in November 2023 and remanded back to the EPA on the grounds that the EPA s denials were impermissibly retroactive and that the EPA s interpretation was contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious as applied to petitioners exemptions.

These recognized amounts are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations and represent costs to comply with the RFS obligation through purchasing of RINs not otherwise reduced by blending of ethanol, biodiesel, or renewable diesel.

 of Icahn Enterprises GP and approximately of Icahn Enterprises outstanding depositary units as of September 30, 2024. Applicable pension and tax laws make each member of a controlled group of entities, generally defined as entities in which there is at least an 80 common ownership interest, jointly and severally liable for certain pension plan obligations of any member of the controlled group. These pension obligations include ongoing contributions to fund the plan, as well as liability for any unfunded liabilities that may exist at the time the plan is terminated. In addition, the failure to pay these pension obligations when due may result in the creation of liens in favor of the pension plan or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC against the assets of each member of the controlled group. As a result of the more than ownership interest in us by Mr. Icahn s affiliates, we and our subsidiaries are subject to the pension liabilities of entities in which Mr. Icahn has a direct or indirect ownership interest of at least , which includes the liabilities of pension plans sponsored by Viskase and ACF Industries LLC ACF ), an affiliate of Mr. Icahn. All the minimum funding requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for the Viskase and ACF plans have been met as of September 30, 2024. If the plans were voluntarily terminated, they would be underfunded by an aggregate of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. These results are based on the most recent information provided by the plans actuaries. These liabilities could increase or decrease, depending on a number of factors, including future changes in benefits, investment returns, and the assumptions used to calculate the liability. As members of the controlled group, we would be liable for any failure of Viskase or ACF to make ongoing pension contributions or to pay the unfunded liabilities upon a termination of the Viskase or ACF pension plans. In addition, other entities now or in the future within the controlled group in which we are included may have pension plan obligations that are, or may become, underfunded and we would be liable for any failure of such entities to make ongoing pension contributions or to pay the unfunded liabilities upon termination of such plans. The current aggregate underfunded status of the pension plans of Viskase and ACF requires them to notify the PBGC of certain reportable events, such as if we cease to be a member of the Viskase or ACF controlled group, or if we make certain extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions. The obligation to report could cause us to seek to delay or reconsider the occurrence of such reportable events. Starfire Holding Corporation Starfire ), which is owned by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us and Brett Icahn), has undertaken to indemnify us and our subsidiaries from losses resulting from any imposition of certain pension funding or termination liabilities that may be imposed on us and our subsidiaries or our assets as a result of being a member of the Icahn controlled group, including ACF. The Starfire indemnity provides, among other things, that so long as such contingent liabilities exist and could be imposed on us, Starfire will not make any distributions to its stockholders that would reduce its net worth to below million. Nonetheless, Starfire may not be able to fund its indemnification obligations to us.

Icahn Enterprises L.P. et al. , Case No. 23-21773 (S.D. Fl.), and Levine v. Icahn Enterprises L.P. et al. , Case No. 23-22009 (S.D. Fl.). These lawsuits were consolidated and the court appointed a lead plaintiff on November 20, 2023. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated class action complaint on January 12, 2024, and we filed our motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint on March 12, 2024. On September 13, 2024, the proposed class action lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice. Pursuant to the court s order dismissing the complaint, the plaintiffs had until October 14, 2024 to amend their complaint, and plaintiffs did not file an amendment prior to the expiration of this deadline. A derivative complaint has also been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, naming the Company s general partner, its directors, and certain current and former officers as defendants, and the Company as a nominal defendant, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties with respect to the Company s disclosure, Patrick Pickney v.

Investment Fund Distribution and Redemption See Investment Funds Redemptions and Distributions below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Results of Operations Consolidated Financial Results Our operating businesses comprise consolidated subsidiaries which operate in various industries and are managed on a decentralized basis. In addition to our Investment segment s revenues from investment transactions, revenues for our operating businesses primarily consist of net sales of various products, services revenue, franchisor operations and leasing of real estate. Due to the structure and nature of our business, we primarily discuss the results of operations by individual reporting segment in order to better understand our consolidated operating performance. In addition to the summarized financial results below, refer to Note 14, Segment Reporting, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of each of our reporting segment s results of continuing operations to our consolidated results. The conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing Russian/Ukraine conflict can significantly impact the global oil, fertilizer, and agriculture markets. Such conflicts pose significant geopolitical risks to global markets, raise concerns of major implications, such as enforcement of sanctions, can contribute to further oil price volatility, and can disrupt the production and trade of fertilizer, grains, and feedstock supply through several means, including trade restrictions and supply chain disruptions. The ultimate outcome of these conflicts and any associated market disruptions are difficult to predict and may affect our business, operations, and cash flows in unforeseen ways.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately 2.7 billion and 3.2 billion, respectively in the Investment Funds. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates (excluding us and Brett Icahn) was approximately 1.5 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively. Our Investment segment s results of operations are reflected in net income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Our Investment segment s net income (loss) is driven by the amount of funds allocated to the Investment Funds and the performance of the underlying investments in the Investment Funds. Future funds allocated to the Investment Funds may increase or decrease based on the contributions and redemptions by our Holding Company, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates and by Brett Icahn, Mr. Icahn s son. Additionally, historical performance results of the Investment Funds are not indicative of future results as past market conditions, investment opportunities and investment decisions may not occur in the future. Changes in general market conditions coupled with changes in exposure to short and long positions have significant impact on our Investment segment s results of operations and the comparability of results of operations year over year and as such, future results of operations will be impacted by our future exposures and future market conditions, which may not be consistent with prior trends.

 positive performance of our Investment segment s long positions was driven primarily by net gains in the utilities sector of 266 million, offset in part by net losses in the energy sector of 227 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Investment Funds negative performance was primarily driven by net losses in short and long positions. The negative performance of our Investment segment s short positions was driven primarily by losses from a broad market hedge of 439 million, and several energy segment investments of 226 million as well as the aggregate performance of short equity positions with net losses across various sectors of 239 million. The negative performance of our Investment segment s long positions was driven primarily by the negative performance of one healthcare sector investment of 163 million and one material sector investment of 145 million as well as the aggregate performance of investments with net losses across various sectors. Energy Our Energy segment is primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses. The petroleum business accounted for approximately 93 and 92 of our Energy segment s net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The results of operations of the petroleum business are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel that are produced by a refinery Refined Products ). The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which Refined Products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond our Energy segment s control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline, distillate, and other refined products, which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, driving habits, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability or permissibility of imports and exports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulations. Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact gross margin as a result of changes in the value of its unhedged inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the petroleum business results of operations is partially influenced by the rate at which the processing of Refined Products adjusts to reflect these changes. In addition to geopolitical conditions, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for and inventory of Refined Products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed and enacted climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage and emissions standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the EPA s Renewable Fuel Standard RFS ), which, each year, absent exemptions or waivers, requires the operating companies in our Energy segment to blend renewable fuels with their transportation fuels, purchase renewable identification numbers RINs ), to the extent available, in lieu of blending, or face liability. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and the future cost of RINs for the petroleum business is difficult to estimate. Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include but are not limited to the availability of RINs for purchase, the actions of RINs market participants including non-obligated parties, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel and renewable diesel production levels and pricing, the mix of the petroleum business petroleum products, the refining margin of the petroleum business and other factors, all of which can vary significantly from period to period, as well as certain waivers or exemptions to which the petroleum business obligated-party subsidiaries may be entitled. The costs to comply with the RFS are also impacted by, and dependent upon the outcome of, the numerous lawsuits filed by multiple refiners including the petroleum business obligated-party subsidiaries, biofuels groups and others. Refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of RINs. In recent years, our Energy segment has focused on several decarbonization initiatives including completion of construction of the renewable diesel and renewable feedstock pre-treatment units at the Wynnewood Refinery, creation of an Environmental, Social and Governance ESG committee and the publication of ESG reports and restructuring to better align with management and financial reporting. Our Energy segment expects to continue to explore options to decarbonize its business in areas with attractive economics, without sole reliance on government subsidies.

The decrease in the petroleum business net sales was due to lower refined product prices resulting from elevated inventory levels and reduced demand along with a decline in sales as a result of the Wynnewood Refinery fire and an unplanned outage at the Coffeyville Refinery. The decrease in our nitrogen fertilizer business net sales was primarily due to a decrease in urea ammonium nitrate UAN sales volumes, offset in part by favorable UAN and ammonia pricing conditions in the current period. Cost of goods sold for our Energy segment decreased by 134 million (7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to declines in our petroleum business as a result of a decrease in net sales and increased RFS expenses of 187 million which includes unfavorable RINs liability revaluation of 232 million, offset in part by a favorable derivatives impact of 97 million in the current period compared to losses in the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Automotive Our Automotive segment s results of operations are generally driven by the demand for automotive service and maintenance, which is impacted by general economic factors, vehicle miles traveled, and the average age of vehicles on the road, among other factors. Our Automotive segment has been in the process of a multi-year transformation plan. As part of this plan, our Automotive segment completed the separation of certain of its Automotive Services and Aftermarket Parts businesses into two separate operating companies. Auto Plus, which operated the majority of our Aftermarket Parts business, began operating in locations owned and leased by the Aftermarket Services business. In January 2023, Auto Plus filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, resulting in the cessation of operations and deconsolidation, which reduced our Automotive segment s assets. Our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include the results of Auto Plus prior to its deconsolidation as of January 31, 2023. Following the bankruptcy, Auto Plus exited the Automotive Services locations within which it operated. Our Automotive segment s results also include AEP PLC LLC AEP PLC ), which acquired 10 million in assets, mainly comprised of Aftermarket Parts inventory from the Auto Plus auction. We are in the process of selling the remaining inventory which we expect will be complete by the end of 2024 and which would remove us from the Aftermarket Parts business. In connection with its transformation plan, the Automotive segment leases available and excess real estate in certain locations under long-term operating leases, in which the Aftermarket Parts business formally operated. During the third quarter of 2024, we experienced declining sales in our Automotive Services business, due to, among other factors, reduced consumer spending on automotive repairs and maintenance and certain operational challenges, resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows. This led to a goodwill triggering event during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Our goodwill impairment testing concluded that no impairment is required at this time, and we have undertaken operational changes, including changes in management and strategy, that we believe will lead to improvements in the performance of the business and cash flows. However, if our growth and profitability initiatives do not realize their expected benefits, our assets in this business may be subject to impairment. Our Automotive segment s priorities include: Positioning the Automotive Services broad offerings to take advantage of opportunities in the do-it-for-me market and vehicle fleets; Strategic investment in brownfield and greenfield supplementing existing store footprints; Investment in, and strategic review of, capital projects within Icahn Automotive s owned and leased locations to increase leasing revenue, restructure lease liabilities, and reduce occupancy costs; Optimization of Store and Distribution Center network while improving inventory and cost position; Investment to improve the overall customer experience through process, facilities and automation; Investment in employees with focus on training and career development; and Business process improvements and sharing best practices through investments in people, technology, and our overall supply chain.

Pharma Our Pharma segment derives revenues primarily from the sale of its products directly to customers, wholesalers and pharmacies. Pursuant to previously announced settlement agreements, at the end of 2024 a competitor, and in the second half of 2025 a second competitor, will be permitted to launch competing generic products to the patent protected weight loss treatment sold within our Pharma segment in the United States, which we anticipate will cause a moderate reduction of prescription volume in the retail pharmacy market in the United States. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2 million (8 as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to continued higher prescription growth resulting in increased sales.

 Holding Company Our Holding Company s results of operations primarily reflect the loss on deconsolidation of one of its subsidiaries, credit loss on its related party note receivable, and interest expense on its senior unsecured notes for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary As discussed in Note 3, Subsidiary Bankruptcy and Deconsolidation , to the consolidated financial statements, we deconsolidated Auto Plus effective as of January 31, 2023, resulting in a pretax loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of 246 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Credit loss on related party note receivable Our credit loss on related party note receivable of 139 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the note receivable expected to be uncollectible. Other Consolidated Results of Operations Selling, General and Administrative Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Our consolidated selling, general and administrative costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 7 million (3 as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower expenses of our Automotive segment of 14 million mainly related to the deconsolidation of Auto Plus. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Our consolidated selling, general and administrative costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 75 million (11 as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower expenses of our Automotive segment of 59 million mainly related to the deconsolidation of Auto Plus. Interest Expense Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Our consolidated interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 18 million (12 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense for our Investment segment of 30 million attributable to changes in short exposure composition. The decrease was offset in part by higher interest expense in our Holding Company segment of 9 million mainly due to the refinancing of bonds at higher rates than the comparable prior year period. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Our consolidated interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 32 million (8 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense for our Investment segment of 69 million attributable to changes in short exposure. The decrease was offset in part by higher interest expense in our Holding Company segment and Energy segment of 20 million and 19 million, respectively, mainly due to the refinancing of bonds at higher interest rates than the comparative period.

 Income Tax Expense Certain of our subsidiaries are partnerships not subject to taxation in our condensed consolidated financial statements and certain other subsidiaries are corporations, or subsidiaries of corporations, subject to taxation in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, our consolidated effective tax rate generally differs from the statutory federal tax rate. Refer to Note 15, Income Taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Holding Company Liquidity We are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with respect to depositary units depends on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity offerings and debt financings, interest income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means include receipt of dividends and distributions from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries or selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital market transactions. To the degree any distributions and transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. For the third quarter of 2024, CVR Energy, our subsidiary in our Energy segment, elected to suspend payment of its cash dividend which will reduce our cash flow for the relevant period. In addition, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements. As of September 30, 2024, our Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1.6 billion and total debt of approximately 4.7 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our Holding Company had investments in the Investment Funds with a total fair market value of approximately 2.7 billion. We may redeem our direct investment in the Investment Funds upon notice. See Investment Segment Liquidity, including under Investment Funds Redemptions and Distributions, below for additional information with respect to our Investment segment liquidity.

Holding Company debt consists of various issues of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued by Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Finance Corp. (together the Issuers and guaranteed by Icahn Enterprises Holdings (the Guarantor ). Interest on each tranche of senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually. In May 2024, the Issuers issued 750 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.000 senior unsecured notes due 2030. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem the remaining outstanding 6.375 senior unsecured notes due 2025 in full on June 13, 2024. Each of our senior unsecured notes and the related guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers and rank equally with all of the Issuers and the Guarantor s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior to all of the Issuers and the Guarantor s existing and future subordinated indebtedness. Each of our senior unsecured notes and the related guarantees are effectively subordinated to the Issuers and the Guarantor s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. Each of our senior unsecured notes and the related guarantees are also effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuers subsidiaries other than the Guarantor. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes described above restrict the payment of cash distributions, the purchase of equity interests or the purchase, redemption, defeasance or acquisition of debt subordinated to the senior unsecured notes. The indentures also restrict the incurrence of debt or the issuance of disqualified stock, as defined in the indentures, with certain exceptions. In addition, the indentures require that on each quarterly determination date, Icahn Enterprises and the guarantor of the notes (currently only Icahn Enterprises Holdings) maintain certain minimum financial ratios, as defined therein. The indentures also restrict the creation of liens, mergers, consolidations and sales of substantially all of our assets, and transactions with affiliates. During the second quarter of 2024, the 6.375 senior notes due 2026 became callable without a premium. Additionally, each of the 5.250 seniors notes due 2027, the 4.375 senior notes due 2029 and the 9.000 senior notes due 2030 are subject to optional redemption premiums in the event we redeem any of these notes prior to six months before maturity. The 9.750 senior notes due 2029 are subject to optional redemption premiums in the event we redeem these notes prior to three months before maturity. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants, including maintaining certain minimum financial ratios, as defined in the indentures. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, based on covenants in the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, we are not permitted to incur additional indebtedness; however, we are permitted to issue new notes in connection with debt refinancings of existing notes.

 Debt Repurchase and Sales In November and December of 2023, we repurchased in the open market approximately 35 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.750 senior unsecured notes due 2024, 12 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.25 senior unsecured notes due 2026, 5 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.25 senior unsecured notes due 2027, and 40 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.375 senior unsecured notes due 2029 for total cash paid of 84 million for a total aggregate principal amount 92 million. The Company cancelled and reduced the outstanding principal of the repurchased 4.750 senior unsecured notes due 2024, and the remaining repurchased notes of 57 million aggregate principal were extinguished but were not retired and are held in treasury. In April 2024, we sold the 12 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.250 senior unsecured notes due 2026 and the 5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.250 senior unsecured notes due 2027, both previously repurchased and held in treasury, in the open market. In August and September of 2024, we repurchased in the open market approximately 52 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.25 senior unsecured notes due 2026, 73 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.25 senior unsecured notes due 2027, and 52 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.375 senior unsecured notes due 2029. The repurchased notes of 217 million aggregate principal were extinguished but were not retired and are held in treasury. At-The-Market Offerings During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 233,000 depositary units pursuant to the Open Market Sale Agreement entered into November 21, 2022, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 5,806,986 depositary units pursuant to the Open Market Sale Agreement, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 102 million. On August 26, 2024, we entered into a new Open Market Sales Agreement providing for sales of depositary units of up to 400 million. We continue to have effective Open Market Sale Agreements and Icahn Enterprises may sell its depositary units for up to an additional 47 million in aggregate gross sale proceeds pursuant to its Open Market Sales Agreement entered into November 21, 2022 and up to 400 million in aggregate gross sales proceeds pursuant to its Open Market Sales Agreement entered into August 26, 2024. No assurance can be made that any or all amounts will be sold during the term of the agreements, and we have no obligation to sell additional depositary units under the Open Market Sale Agreements. Depending on market conditions, we may continue to sell depositary units under our effective Open Market Sale Agreements, and, if appropriate, enter into a new Open Market Sale Agreement to continue our At-The-Market sales program. Our ability to access remaining capital under our At-The-Market program may be limited by market conditions at the time of any future potential sale. While we were able to sell depositary units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there can be no assurance that any future capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all under this program. LP Unit Distributions During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Icahn Enterprises declared three quarterly distributions, each distribution in the amount of 1.00 per depositary unit in which each depositary unitholder had the option to make an election to receive either cash or additional depositary units. In connection with these distributions, aggregate cash distributions to all depositary unitholders that made a timely election to receive cash was 314 million, of which 175 million was distributed to Mr. Icahn and his affiliates. On November 6, 2024, the Board of Directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of 0.50 per depositary unit, which will be paid on or about December 26, 2024 to depositary unitholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2024. Depositary unitholders will have until December 13, 2024 to make a timely election to receive either cash or additional depositary units. If a unitholder does not make a timely election, it will automatically be deemed to have elected to receive the distribution in additional depositary units. Depositary unitholders who elect to receive (or who are deemed to have elected to receive) additional depositary units will receive units valued at the volume weighted average trading price of the units during the five consecutive trading days ending December 20, 2024. Icahn Enterprises will make a cash payment in lieu of issuing fractional depositary units to any unitholders electing to receive (or who are deemed to have elected to receive) depositary units.

 Repurchase Authorization On May 9, 2023, the Board of Directors of Icahn Enterprises GP, the Company s General Partner, approved a repurchase program which authorizes Icahn Enterprises or affiliates of Icahn Enterprises to repurchase up to an aggregate of 500 million worth of any of our outstanding fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued by Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Finance Corp. and up to an aggregate of 500 million worth of the depositary units issued by Icahn Enterprises (the Repurchase Program ). The repurchases of senior notes or depositary units may be done for cash from time to time in the open market, through tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions upon such terms and at such prices as management may determine. The authorization of the Repurchase Program is for an indefinite term and does not expire until later terminated by the Board of Directors of Icahn Enterprises GP. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not repurchased any of the Company s depositary units and the Company has repurchased 269 million worth of senior unsecured notes in aggregate under the Repurchase Program. See Debt Repurchases and Sales above. On November 6, 2024, the Board re-approved the Repurchase Program, and, pursuant to the reapproved Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional 500 million worth of our outstanding fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, in addition to the approximately 269 million we have already repurchased under the Repurchase Program, and we remain authorized to repurchase up to 500 million of our depositary units. Investment Segment Liquidity In addition to investments by us and Mr. Icahn, the Investment Funds historically have access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions. Our cash held at consolidated affiliated partnerships balance was 808 million and 1,068 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Cash held at consolidated affiliated partnerships relates to our Investment segment and consists of cash and cash equivalents held by the Investment Funds that, although not legally restricted, are not used for the general operating needs of the Investment segment or Icahn Enterprises. Additionally, our Investment segment liquidity is driven by the investment activities and performance of the Investment Funds. As of September 30, 2024, the Investment Funds had a net short notional exposure of 2 . The Investment Funds long exposure was 113 (100 long equity and 13 long credit) and its short exposure was 115 (92 short equity, 20 short credit and 3 short commodity). The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds invested capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at September 30, 2024. Of the Investment Funds 113 long exposure, 58 was comprised of the fair value of its long positions and 55 was comprised mostly of single name equity forward and swap contracts. Of the Investment Funds 115 short exposure, 63 was comprised of the fair value of its short positions and 52 was comprised mostly of short broad market index swap derivative contracts, short credit default swap contracts and short commodity contracts. With respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (58 long exposure) and our short positions that are not notionalized (63 short exposure), each 1 change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would have a 1 impact on our cash and cash equivalents (as a percentage of net asset value). Changes in exposure as a result of purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant to prime brokerage lines of credit. With respect to the notional value of our other long positions (55 long exposure) and short positions (52 short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at quarter end prices. This would be offset by a release of restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral and then post additional collateral equal to 100 of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.

Critical Accounting Estimates The critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements that we believe affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in this Report are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Except as discussed below, information about our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk did not differ materially from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Market Risk Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our Investment segment and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of the Investment Funds investments. Investment The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Investment Funds primarily fluctuates in response to changes in the value of securities. The net effect of these fair value changes impacts the net gains from investment activities in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Investment Funds risk is regularly evaluated and is managed on a position basis as well as on a portfolio basis. Senior members of our investment team meet on a regular basis to assess and review certain risks, including concentration risk, correlation risk and credit risk for significant positions. Certain risk metrics and other analytical tools are used in the normal course of business by the Investment segment. The Investment Funds hold investments that are reported at fair value as of the reporting date, which include securities owned, securities sold, not yet purchased and derivatives as reported on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Based on their respective balances as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that in the event of a 10 adverse change in the fair value of these investments, the fair values of securities owned, securities sold, not yet purchased and derivatives would be negatively impacted by approximately 248 million, 268 million and 498 million, respectively. However, as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that the impact to our share of the net gain (loss) from investment activities reported in our condensed consolidated statement of operations would be less than the change in fair value since we have an interest of approximately 64 in the Investment Funds.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Icahn Enterprises and subsidiaries disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are, and will continue to be, subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1 of this Report, for information regarding our lawsuits and proceedings. Except for the lawsuits and proceedings disclosed in Note 18, there were no material changes to our lawsuits and proceedings as compared to those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 1A. Risk Factors Other than as set forth below, there were no material changes to our risk factors during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our general partner, and its control person, has significant influence over us, and sales by our controlling unitholder pursuant to a margin call or otherwise could cause our unit price or the value of our assets in the Investment Funds to decline or otherwise impact our liquidity. Mr. Icahn, through affiliates, owns 100 of Icahn Enterprises GP, the general partner of Icahn Enterprises, and approximately 86 of Icahn Enterprises outstanding depositary units as of September 30, 2024, and, as a result, has the ability to influence many aspects of our operations and affairs. Mr. Icahn s estate plan has been designed to assure the stability and continuation of Icahn Enterprises and to minimize the need to monetize his interests for estate tax or other purposes. In the event of Mr. Icahn s death, a substantial majority of Mr. Icahn s interests in Icahn Enterprises and its general partner are expected to pass to trusts or charitable organizations that will be under the control of a group that will include Icahn family members and current or former senior Icahn Enterprises executives. However, there can be no assurance that such planning will be effective. Furthermore, if upon Mr. Icahn s death control of Icahn Enterprises GP is not given to Brett Icahn, Brett Icahn will have the right to terminate the manager agreement between Brett Icahn and Icahn Enterprises. In addition, it is currently anticipated that Brett Icahn will succeed Carl Icahn as Chairman of the board of Icahn Enterprises GP and as Chief Executive Officer of the Investment segment following the end of the 7-year term of the manager agreement or earlier if Carl Icahn should so determine. In addition, in past years through the present, Mr. Icahn from time to time has had and currently has borrowings from lenders and has pledged assets he owns personally, directly or through his affiliates, to secure these loans, which pledged assets include Icahn Enterprises depositary units and interests in the Investment Funds. The number of depositary units and the amount of interests in the Investment Funds owned personally by Mr. Icahn, directly or through his affiliates, pledged to secure these loans has been substantial and has fluctuated over time as a result of the amount of outstanding principal amount of the loans, the market price of the depositary units, the value of the Investment Fund interests, and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates have pledged 433,206,933 depositary units and approximately 1.1 billion of interests in the Investment Funds. Neither Icahn Enterprises nor any of its subsidiaries are party to these loans. Mr. Icahn amended and restated his loan agreements in July of 2023 (as amended and restated, the Loan Agreement ), extending the maturity of certain of the previous loans, amending certain covenants, and providing for a principal payment of 500 million that was made prior to September 1, 2023, quarterly principal payments of 87.5 million beginning in September 2024, and a final principal payment of 2.6 billion at the end of the term. On July 2, 2024, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Loan Agreement Amendment No. 1 ). Among other changes, Amendment No. 1 extended the maturity of the Loan Agreement to July 2027 and correspondingly extended the payment due dates under the Loan Agreement, amended certain covenants, provided for a principal payment of approximately 453 million in connection with the execution of Amendment No. 1, and provided for additional quarterly principal payments of 87.5 million during the additional term of the Loan Agreement. In addition, Amendment No. 1 provides for the pledging by Mr. Icahn of (i) depositary units of IEP owned by Mr. Icahn, (ii) interests owned by Mr. Icahn in the Investment Funds, and (iii) certain other collateral unrelated to IEP 

 61

 or the Investment Funds. The terms of the Loan Agreement require that distributions paid upon, or proceeds from sales of, pledged depositary units be used to prepay the loans or be pledged as additional collateral. Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, a margin call may only be triggered in the event that the loan-to-value ratio set forth in the Loan Agreement is not maintained. Unlike the previous loan agreements, for purposes of the loan-to-value ratio set forth in the Loan Agreement, the value of the pledged depositary units will be calculated based upon the Company s indicative net asset value rather than the market price of the depositary units. Only a significant decline in the Company s indicative net asset value, or the value of the interests in the Investment Funds, could result in margin calls. Declines in the trading price of the Company s depositary units will no longer require Mr. Icahn to deposit additional funds or securities with the lenders or suffer foreclosure on or a forced sale of Mr. Icahn s depositary units or other assets. While we are confident in our investment strategy and ability to continue to grow our investment portfolio through a refocused activist strategy, and in the effectiveness of our hedges, which are designed to avoid fluctuations in the value of our portfolio, successful execution of our activist investment activities and other aspects of our business involves many risks (including those set forth herein), some of which are out of our control. Mr. Icahn may sell depositary units or make withdrawals from the Investment Funds in order to satisfy payment obligations under the Loan Agreements. Mr. Icahn has made withdrawals from the Investment Funds in recent months, including in connection with the principal payment made in connection with Amendment No. 1 to the Loan Agreements, and may make additional withdrawals in the future, in order to repay a portion of his loans and for other purposes. In the event Mr. Icahn makes withdrawal requests from the Investment Funds, the Investment Funds may satisfy such withdrawal requests with cash or cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from sales of assets held by the Investment Funds or capital contributions from the Company, which could adversely affect the value of the assets held by the Investment Funds as well as the liquidity available to the Company. The affirmative vote of unitholders holding more than 75 of the total number of all depositary units then outstanding, including depositary units held by Icahn Enterprises GP and its affiliates, is required to remove Icahn Enterprises GP as the general partner of Icahn Enterprises. Mr. Icahn, through affiliates, holds approximately 86 of Icahn Enterprises outstanding depositary units. If sales of depositary units held by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates, as a result of a margin call, foreclosure, changes in tax laws, changes to his estate, or otherwise, were to cause Mr. Icahn and his affiliates to no longer hold at least 25 of the outstanding depositary units, Icahn Enterprises GP could potentially be removed as the general partner of Icahn Enterprises without Mr. Icahn s consent. Sales of a substantial number of depositary units held by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates could have a negative impact on the market price of our depositary units. Likewise, the market may anticipate sales by Mr. Icahn or his estate even if Mr. Icahn or his estate is not selling, or has no plans to sell, depositary units. The Investment Funds investment strategy involves numerous and significant risks, including the risk that we may lose some or all of our investments in the Investment Funds. This risk may be magnified due to concentration of investments and investments in undervalued securities. Our Investment segment s revenue depends on the investments made by the Investment Funds. There are numerous and significant risks associated with these investments, certain of which are described in this risk factor and in other risk factors set forth herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. Certain investment positions held by the Investment Funds may be illiquid. The Investment Funds may own restricted or non-publicly traded securities and securities traded on foreign exchanges. We may also have significant influence with respect to certain companies owned by the Investment Funds, including representation on the board of directors of certain companies, and may be subject to trading restrictions with respect to specific positions in the Investment Funds at any particular time. These investments and trading restrictions could prevent the Investment Funds from liquidating unfavorable positions promptly and subject the Investment Funds to substantial losses. At any given time, the Investment Funds assets may become highly concentrated within a particular company, industry, asset category, trading style or financial or economic market, and the level of concentration can be increased 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 through the use of swaps or other derivative instruments. In that event, the Investment Funds investment portfolio will be more susceptible to fluctuations in value resulting from adverse events, developments or economic conditions affecting the performance of that particular company, industry, asset category, trading style or economic market than a less concentrated portfolio would be. As a result, the Investment Funds investment portfolio s aggregate returns may be volatile and may be affected substantially by the performance of only one or a few holdings. Typically, our top holdings in the Investment Funds represent a significant percentage of our assets under management for the Investment Segment. Therefore, a significant decline in the fair market values of our larger positions may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and the trading price of our depositary units. Certain of the companies in our Investment Funds file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC, which are publicly available, and contain additional risk factors with respect to such companies. The Investment Funds seek to invest in securities that are undervalued. The identification of investment opportunities in undervalued securities is challenging, and there are no assurances that such opportunities will be successfully recognized or acquired. While investments in undervalued securities offer the opportunity for above-average capital appreciation, these investments involve a high degree of financial risk and can result in substantial losses. Returns generated from the Investment Funds investments may not adequately compensate for the business and financial risks assumed. From time to time, the Investment Funds may invest in bonds or other fixed income securities, such as commercial paper and higher yielding (and, therefore, higher risk) debt securities. It is likely that a major economic recession could severely disrupt the market for such securities and may have a material adverse impact on the value of such securities. In addition, it is likely that any such economic downturn could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such securities to repay principal and pay interest thereon and increase the incidence of default for such securities. For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth in this Report (e.g., supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the securities in which the Investment Funds invest may decline substantially. In particular, purchasing assets at what may appear to be undervalued levels is no guarantee that these assets will not be trading at even more undervalued or otherwise lower levels at a future time of valuation or at the time of sale. The prices of financial instruments in which the Investment Funds may invest can be highly volatile. Price movements of forward and other derivative contracts in which the Investment Funds assets may be invested are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments, and national and international political and economic events and policies. Pursuant to the terms of our swap and other derivative agreements, certain events, including a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filing involving the company issuing the securities referenced by such agreements or a delisting of such referenced securities, could give our derivative counterparties termination rights that would result in the closing of our swap positions and the realization of any and all losses, even if the referenced securities are not extinguished and thereafter appreciate in value. The Investment Funds are subject to the risk of failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses. The use of leverage in investments by the Investment Funds may pose a significant degree of risk and may enhance the possibility of significant loss in the value of the investments in the Investment Funds. The Investment Funds may leverage their capital if their general partners believe that the use of leverage may enable the Investment Funds to achieve a higher rate of return. Accordingly, the Investment Funds may pledge their securities in order to borrow additional funds for investment purposes. The Investment Funds may also leverage their investment return with options, short sales, swaps, forwards and other derivative instruments. The amount of borrowings that the Investment Funds may have outstanding at any time may be substantial in relation to their capital. While leverage may present opportunities for increasing the Investment Funds total return, leverage may increase losses as well. Accordingly, any event that adversely affects the value of an investment by the Investment Funds would be magnified to the extent such fund is leveraged, and the value of derivatives or other instruments used to provide leverage may not always be correlated to the value of the reference equity security, which could lead to increased losses in circumstances when the value of the reference security remains higher than that of the derivative. The cumulative effect of the use of 

 63 

Table of Contents 
 leverage by the Investment Funds in a market that moves adversely to the Investment Funds investments could result in a substantial loss to the Investment Funds that would be greater than if the Investment Funds were not leveraged. There is no assurance that leverage will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In general, the use of short-term margin borrowings results in certain additional risks to the Investment Funds. For example, should the securities pledged to brokers to secure any Investment Fund s margin accounts decline in value, the Investment Funds could be subject to a margin call, pursuant to which it must either deposit additional funds or securities with the broker, or suffer mandatory liquidation of the pledged securities to compensate for the decline in value. In the event of a sudden drop in the value of any of the Investment Funds assets, the Investment Funds might not be able to liquidate assets quickly enough to satisfy its margin requirements. The Investment Funds may enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. When the Investment Fund enters into a repurchase agreement, it sells securities issued by the U.S. or a non-U.S. government, or agencies thereof, to a broker-dealer or financial institution, and agrees to repurchase such securities for the price paid by the broker-dealer or financial institution, plus interest at a negotiated rate. In a reverse repurchase transaction, the Investment Fund buys securities issued by the U.S. or a non-U.S. government, or agencies thereof, from a broker-dealer or financial institution, subject to the obligation of the broker-dealer or financial institution to repurchase such securities at the price paid by the Investment Funds, plus interest at a negotiated rate. The use of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements by any of the Investment Funds involves certain risks. For example, if the seller of securities to the Investment Funds under a reverse repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying securities, as a result of its bankruptcy or otherwise, the Investment Funds will seek to dispose of such securities, which action could involve costs or delays. If the seller becomes insolvent and subject to liquidation or reorganization under applicable bankruptcy or other laws, the Investment Funds ability to dispose of the underlying securities may be restricted. Finally, if a seller defaults on its obligation to repurchase securities under a reverse repurchase agreement, the Investment Funds may suffer a loss to the extent it is forced to liquidate its position in the market, and proceeds from the sale of the underlying securities are less than the repurchase price agreed to by the defaulting seller. The financing used by the Investment Funds to leverage its portfolio will be extended by securities brokers and dealers in the marketplace in which the Investment Funds invest. While the Investment Funds will attempt to negotiate the terms of these financing arrangements with such brokers and dealers, its ability to do so will be limited. The Investment Funds are therefore subject to changes in the value that the broker-dealer ascribes to a given security or position, the amount of margin required to support such security or position, the borrowing rate to finance such security or position and/or such broker-dealer s willingness to continue to provide any such credit to the Investment Funds. Because the Investment Funds currently have no alternative credit facility which could be used to finance its portfolio in the absence of financing from broker-dealers, it could be forced to liquidate its portfolio on short notice to meet its financing obligations. The forced liquidation of all or a portion of the Investment Funds portfolios at distressed prices could result in significant losses to the Investment Funds.
