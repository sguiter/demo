Under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, the Fund is prohibited from acquiring any additional non-qualifying assets unless, at the time of acquisition, certain specified qualifying assets (e.g., securities issued by an eligible portfolio company, as defined in Section 2(a)(46)) represent at least 70 of its total assets. As part of this calculation, the numerator consists of the fair value of the Fund's investments in all eligible portfolio companies, and the denominator consists of total assets less those assets described in Section 55(a)(7) of the 1940 Act.

 The Fund s investment objective is to achieve superior risk-adjusted investment returns and it seeks to achieve that objective by providing debt financing to portfolio companies, most of which are private. The Fund generally receives warrants to acquire equity securities in connection with its portfolio investments and generally distributes these warrants to its shareholder upon receipt, or soon thereafter. The Fund also has guidelines for the percentages of total assets that are invested in different types of assets. The portfolio investments of the Fund primarily consist of debt financing to early and expansion stage venture capital-backed technology companies. 
 
 In the Manager s opinion, the accompanying condensed interim financial statements (hereafter referred to as financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations for interim periods. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP have been omitted; however, the Fund believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

million and million, respectively, (or and of total assets, respectively) with the fair values determined by the Manager in the absence of readily determinable market values. Because of the inherent uncertainty of these valuations, estimated fair values of such investments may differ significantly from the fair values that would have been used had a readily available market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material. Below is the information used by the Manager in making these estimates. 
 
 Loans 
 
 The Fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to lower a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Because there is no readily available market price and no secondary market for substantially all of the debt investments made by the Fund in its borrowing portfolio companies, Management determines fair value based on a transaction that would occur in the most advantageous market, and on several factors related to each borrower, including, but not limited to, the borrower s payment history, available cash and burn rate, revenues, net income or loss, the likelihood that the borrower will be able to secure additional financing in the future, and an evaluation of the general interest rate environment. The amount of any valuation adjustment considers the estimated amount and timing of cash payments of principal and interest from the borrower and/or liquidation analysis and is determined based upon a credit analysis of the borrower and an analysis of the expected recovery from the borrower, including consideration of factors such as the nature and quality of the Fund s security interests in collateral, the estimated fair value of the Fund s collateral, the size of the loan, and the estimated time that will elapse before the Fund achieves a recovery. Where the risk profile is consistent with the original underwriting, the cost basis of substantially all of the loans approximates fair value. Management has evaluated these factors and has concluded that the effect of deterioration in the quality of the underlying collateral, increase in size of the loan, increase in the estimated time to recovery and increase in the market coupon rate would have the effect of lowering the fair value of the current portfolio of loans. 

Non-Accrual Loans 
 
 The Fund s policy is to classify a loan as non-accrual when the portfolio company is delinquent for three consecutive months on its monthly loan payment or for a lesser timeframe, if, in the opinion of Management, the portfolio company either ceases or drastically curtails its operations and Management deems that it is unlikely that the loan will return to performing status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status and the related interest is determined to not be collectible, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed. Any future interest received by the Fund on non-accrual loans will be recognized as interest income if and when the proceeds exceed the book value of the respective loan. 
 
 If a borrower of a non-accrual loan resumes making regular payments and Management believes that such borrower has regained the ability to service the loan on a sustainable basis, the loan is reclassified back to accrual or performing status. Interest that would have been accrued during the time a loan was classified as non-accrual will be added back to the remaining payment schedule, causing a change in the effective interest rate. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans with a cost basis of million and million and a fair value of million and million, respectively, were classified as non-accrual.

. The effect of an increase in the estimated initial term of the warrants used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the fair value of the warrants. However, the estimated initial term of the warrants is one factor, of many, used in the valuation of warrants, and by itself does not have a significant impact on the results of operations. 
 
 The risk-free interest rate is derived from the constant maturity tables issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. The effect of an increase in the estimated risk-free rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of increasing the fair value of the warrants.

 Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and rates earned by the Fund will fluctuate based on many factors including early payoffs, volatility of values ascribed to warrants and new loans funded during the period. Warrants and equity securities received in connection with loan transactions are measured at fair value at the time of acquisition; the non-cash portion of interest income represents the accretion of the discount of these warrants over the life of the loan. 
 
 The risk profile of a loan changes when events occur that impact the credit analysis of the borrower and loan as discussed in the Fund s loan accounting policy. Such changes result in the fair value adjustments made to the individual loans, which in accordance with U.S. GAAP, would be based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where the risk profile is consistent with the original underwriting, the cost basis of substantially all of the loans approximates fair value.

million and million, respectively. 
 
 Valuation Hierarchy 
 
 Under the FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement ), the Fund categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by the Fund s valuation techniques. A level is assigned to each fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
 
 The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 
 Level 2 Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
 Level 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The Fund s cash equivalents were valued at the traded net asset value of the money market fund. As a result, these measurements are classified as Level 1. The Fund's derivative instruments are based on quotes from the market makers that derive fair values from market data, and therefore, are classified as Level 2. The Fund s borrowings under the debt facility are also classified as Level 2, because the carrying values of the borrowings are based on rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, which are Level 2 inputs, and that approximate fair values. The Fund s loan investments are individually negotiated and unique, and because there is little to no market in which these assets trade, the unobservable inputs for these assets are valued using estimated exit values. As a result, the Fund's loan investments are classified as Level 3.

Applicable SOFR Margin is the sum of (a) the product of (i) the Subscription Secured Borrowings percentage calculated for such period and (ii) and (b) the product of (i) the Portfolio Secured Borrowings percentage for such period and (ii) . When the Fund is using or more of the maximum amount available under the Loan Agreement, the applicable unused line fee is of the unused portion of the loan facility; otherwise, the applicable unused line fee is of the unused portion. The Fund pays the unused credit line fee quarterly. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, was outstanding under the facility. 

Bank fees and other costs of million incurred in connection with the acquisition and amendment of the facility have been capitalized and are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining unamortized fees and costs of million and million, respectively, are being amortized over the expected life of the facility, which is expected to terminate on October 18, 2026. 
 
 The facility is revolving and as such does not have a specified repayment schedule, although advances are secured by the assets of the Fund and thus repayments will be required as assets decline. The facility contains various covenants including financial covenants related to: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio, (ii) interest coverage ratio, (iii) unfunded commitment ratio, (iv) maximum quarterly loan loss reserve ratio, (v) maximum annual loan loss reserve ratio and (vi) maximum loan loss test. There are also various restrictive covenants, including limitations on: (i) the incurrence of liens, (ii) consolidations, mergers and asset sales and (iii) capital expenditures. The Fund is also required to maintain derivative instruments covering a notional principal amount of at least of the aggregate principal balance of the outstanding borrowings the "Minimum Hedge Percentage"). The Fund is required to comply with this Minimum Hedge percentage only after the date on which the Subscription Secured Borrowings percentage is less than of the Borrowing Base (See Note 8). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Management is not aware of instances of non-compliance with financial covenants.

 million and million, respectively. Because venture loans are privately negotiated transactions, investments in these assets are relatively illiquid. It is the Manager s experience that not all unexpired unfunded commitments will be used by the borrowers. Many credit agreements contain provisions which are milestone dependent and not all borrowers will achieve these milestones. Additionally, the Fund s credit agreements contain provisions that give relief from funding obligations in the event the borrower has a material adverse change to its financial condition. Therefore, the unexpired unfunded commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements or future investments for the Fund.

 Contingencies 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Manager may enter into certain contracts, on behalf of the Fund, that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made that have not yet occurred. Currently, no such claims exist or are expected to arise and, accordingly, the Fund has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 In addition to the historical information contained herein, the information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements reflect the current view of the Fund with respect to future events and financial performance and are subject to several risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Fund s control. All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report, regarding the strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of the Fund are forward-looking statements. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the Ukraine War, conflicts in the Middle East, results of U.S. national and local elections, worldwide inflation, interest rate volatility and natural disasters on the Fund s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words will, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, expect, project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. The Fund does not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 
 The reader of this Quarterly Report should understand that all such forward-looking statements are subject to various uncertainties and risks that could affect their outcome. The Fund s actual results could differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, variances in the actual versus projected growth in assets, return on assets, loan losses, expenses, rates charged on loans and earned on securities investments, competition and macro-economic changes including inflation, interest rate expectations, among other factors including those set forth in the section of this Quarterly Report titled Risk Factors and in Item 1A - Risk Factors in the Fund s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This entire Quarterly Report should be read to put such forward-looking statements in context and to gain a more complete understanding of the uncertainties and risks involved in the Fund s business. 

Overview 
 
 The Fund is 100 owned by the Company. The Fund s shares of common stock, at 0.001 par value, were sold to its sole shareholder, the Company, under a stock purchase agreement. The Fund has issued 100,000 of the Fund s 10,000,000 authorized shares. The Company may make additional capital contributions to the Fund. 
 
 The Fund provides financing and advisory services to a variety of carefully selected venture-backed companies that have received equity funding from traditional sources of venture capital equity funding (i.e. a professionally managed venture capital firm), as well as non-traditional sources of venture capital equity funding (e.g., angel investors, strategic investors, family offices, crowdfunding investment platforms, etc.) (collectively, Venture-Backed Companies ), primarily throughout the United States with a focus on growth-oriented companies. The Fund s portfolio consists of companies in the communications, information services, media, technology (including software and technology-enabled business services), biotechnology, and medical devices industry sectors, among others. The Fund s capital is generally used by its portfolio companies to finance acquisitions of fixed assets and working capital. On October 1, 2021, the Company completed its first closing of capital contributions. On the same day, the Fund made its first investment and became a non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. While the Fund intends to operate as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of Section 5(b)(2) of the 1940 Act, from time to time, the Fund may instead act as a diversified investment company within the meaning of Section 5(b)(1) of the 1940 Act. 
 
 The Fund elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code for federal income tax purposes. Pursuant to this election, the Fund generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income distributed to its shareholder as dividends, allowing the Company to substantially reduce or eliminate its corporate-level tax liability. 
 
 The Fund will seek to meet the ongoing requirements, including the diversification requirements, to qualify as a RIC under the Code. If the Fund fails to meet these requirements, it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year (even if that income is distributed to the members of the Company as ordinary income); thus, such income will be subject to a double layer of taxation. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet the ongoing requirements to qualify as a RIC for tax purposes. 
 
 The Fund s investment objective is to achieve superior risk-adjusted investment returns. The Fund seeks to achieve that objective by providing debt financing to portfolio companies, most of which are private debt securities. The Fund generally receives warrants to acquire equity securities in connection with its portfolio investments and generally distributes these warrants to its shareholder upon receipt, or soon thereafter. The Fund also has guidelines for the percentages of total assets that are invested in different types of assets. 

38 

The portfolio investments of the Fund primarily consist of debt financing to Venture-Backed Companies in the technology sector. The borrower s ability to repay its loans may be adversely impacted by several factors, and as a result, the loan may not be fully repaid. Furthermore, the Fund s security interest in any collateral over the borrower s assets may be insufficient to make up any shortfall in payments. Some of our portfolio companies may be impacted by rising inflation, which could have a material impact on their results of operations, specifically costs and revenues. As such, rising inflation may have an adverse impact on the portfolio borrowers ability to maintain their good credit standing, as well as their ability to pay their interest and principal obligations to the Fund. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations. 
 
 The Fund s investment income is also expected to decline following the end of the Fund's commitment period which is on December 31, 2025. After the commitment period, the Fund may no longer make loan commitments to reinvest the proceeds of matured investments in new loans. Any proceeds will be distributed to the Company. The investment period may be extended by up to two calendar quarters at the discretion of the Manager. 
 
 Transactions with Venture Lending Leasing IX, Inc. 
 
 The Manager also serves as the investment manager for Fund IX. So long as Fund IX had capital available to invest in loan transactions with final maturities earlier than December 31, 2028 (the date on which Fund IX s term of existence automatically expires), the Fund was able to invest in each portfolio company in which Fund IX invested, subject to approval of the Fund's Board. The Manager s allocation process is designed to allocate investment opportunities fairly and equitably among the Fund and Fund IX over time, and subject to board approval, may be based on a methodology taking into account investment pace, the remaining commitment periods and other relevant factors. The Fund co-invested with Fund IX through December 31, 2023, which was the end of Fund IX s investment period. 
 Transactions with WTI Fund XI, Inc. 
 The Manager also serves as the investment manager for Fund XI. So long as Fund XI has capital available to invest in loan transactions with final maturities earlier than December 31, 2031 (the date on which the Fund's term of existence automatically expires), the Fund may invest in each portfolio company in which Fund XI invests, subject to approval of the Fund s Board. The Manager s allocation process is designed to allocate investment opportunities fairly and equitably among the Fund and Fund XI over time, and subject to board approval, may be based on a methodology taking into account investment pace, the remaining commitment periods and other relevant factors. 
 
 The ability of the Fund to co-invest with Fund IX, Fund XI, and other clients advised by the Manager, is subject to Conditions with which the funds are currently complying while seeking certain exemptive relief from the SEC from the provisions of Sections 17(d) and 57 of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder. To the extent that clients, other than Fund XI, advised by the Manager (but in which the Manager has no proprietary interest) invest in opportunities available to the Fund, the Manager will allocate such opportunities among the Fund and such other clients in a manner deemed fair and equitable considering all of the circumstances in accordance with the Conditions. 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Practices and Estimates 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Practices are those accounting policies and practices that are both the most important to the portrayal of the Fund s net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on net assets or operating performance is material. 
 
 In evaluating the most critical accounting policies and estimates, the Manager has identified the estimation of fair value of the Fund s loan investments along with the completeness of loans exhibiting indicators of potential credit deterioration as the most critical of the accounting policies and accounting estimates applied to the Fund s reporting of net assets or operating performance. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; that is, an exit price. The exit price assumes the asset or liability was exchanged in an orderly transaction; it was not a forced liquidation or distressed sale. There is no readily available market price or secondary market for the loans made by the Fund to borrowers, hence the Manager determines fair value based on a transaction that would occur in the most advantageous market and the estimates are subject to high levels of judgment and uncertainty. The Fund s loan investments are considered Level 3 fair value measurements in the fair value hierarchy due to the lack of observability over many of the important inputs used in determining fair value. In particular, the Manager has identified the fair value of the Fund s loan investments that exhibit indicators of the potential for credit deterioration and the completeness of those loan investments, as a critical accounting matter that may involve significant and material estimates and inputs from the Manager in determining the fair value of those loan investments. 

39 

Critical judgments and inputs in determining the fair value of a loan include the estimated timing and amount of future cash flows and probability of future payments, based on the assessment of payment history, available cash and burn rate, revenues, net income or loss, operating results, financial strength of borrower, prospects for the borrower s raising future equity rounds, likelihood of sale or acquisition of the borrower, length of expected holding period of the loan, collateral position, the timing and amount of liquidation of collateral for loans that are experiencing significant credit deterioration and, as a result, collection becomes collateral-dependent, as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment. Management has evaluated these factors and has concluded that the effect of a deterioration in the quality of the underlying collateral, increase in the size of the loan, increase in the estimated time to recovery, and increase in the market coupon rate would each have the effect of decreasing the fair value of loan investments. The risk profile of a loan changes when events occur that impact the credit analysis of the borrower and the loan. Such changes result in the fair value being adjusted from par value of the individual loan. Where the risk profile is consistent with the original underwriting, the cost basis of substantially all loans approximates fair value. 
 
 The actual value of the loans may differ from Management s estimates, which would affect net change in net assets resulting from operations as well as assets. 
 
 The Impact of the Ukraine War, Conflicts in the Middle East, Worldwide Inflation, Interest Rate Volatility and Natural Disasters on Results of Operations and Liquidity Capital Resources 
 
 Global and domestic financial markets have experienced an increase in volatility as concerns about the impact of higher inflation, interest rate volatility, a potential recession, the risk of continued escalation in the Middle East, the Ukraine War, the outbreak of other hostilities or conflict (such as the Houthi attacks on marine vessels in and around the Red Sea), the results of U.S. national and local elections and extreme weather patterns or natural disasters (such as the 2024 earthquake in Taiwan) have weighed on market participants. These factors have created disruptions in supply chains and economic activity and have had a particularly adverse impact on certain industries. These uncertainties can ultimately impact the overall supply and demand of the market through changing spreads, deal terms and structures. The Fund is unable to predict the full impact of these macroeconomic events on the Fund's liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 The Fund is continuing to maintain close communications with its loan portfolio companies to proactively assess and manage potential risks. In addition, Management is continuing to maintain oversight analysis of credits across the Fund's loan investment portfolio in an attempt to manage the potential credit risk and improve loan performance. Certain loans may have inherent increased credit risk due to the nature of the underlying business and its ability to maintain operations in the current economic environment. 
 
 Management is also monitoring the Fund s continued access to capital resources through periodic and timely communication with the bank syndicate and the Company s members. In addition, the Fund will take proactive steps to ensure and maintain an appropriate liquidity position based on its circumstances. The Fund believes its existing cash balance, scheduled monthly payments from borrowers, and access to capital from its debt facility and the Company s members will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. 
 Results of Operations - For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Analysis of Interest Income 
 
 Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 19.1 million and 15.3 million, respectively. Total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 62.3 million and 42.3 million, respectively. Investment income primarily consisted of interest on venture loans outstanding and early loan payoffs. The remaining income consisted of interest and dividends on the temporary investment of cash. 
 
 Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and rates earned by the Fund will fluctuate based on many factors including early payoffs, volatility of values ascribed to warrants, and new loans funded during the year. Warrants and equity securities received in connection with loan transactions are considered to be free standing contracts that are both legally detachable and separately exercisable from the loan transactions and are measured at fair value at the time of acquisition; the non-cash portion of interest income represents the accretion of the discount of these warrants over the life of the loan. 
 
 The following table shows the average outstanding balance, interest income, and weighted average interest rate for the cash and non-cash portion of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income Weighted Average Interest Rate - Cash Portion Weighted Average Interest Rate - Non-Cash Portion Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income Weighted Average Interest Rate - Cash Portion Weighted Average Interest Rate - Non-Cash Portion Performing Loans 395,630,688 18,789,303 14.87 4.13 347,746,029 14,959,269 13.78 3.43 All Loans 412,721,658 18,789,303 14.26 3.95 354,363,316 14,959,269 13.53 3.36 
 
 40 

Interest income for both performing loans and all loans increased by 3.8 million, or 25.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the increased growth in the Fund's loan portfolio and early loan payoffs. The average outstanding balance for performing loans and all loans increased by 47.9 million and 58.4 million, or 13.8 and 16.5 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 The following table shows the average outstanding balance, interest income, and weighted average interest rate for the cash and non-cash portion of interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Interest income for both performing loans and all loans increased by 19.6 million, or 47.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the increased growth in the Fund's loan portfolio and early loan payoffs. The average outstanding balance for performing loans and all loans increased by 76.1 million and 83.4 million, or 24.3 and 26.3 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Analysis of Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense was comprised of amounts related to interest on debt amounts drawn down, unused credit line fees, and amounts amortized from deferred fees incurred in conjunction with the debt facility. 
 
 The following table shows the average balance, interest expense, and weighted average interest rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Average Balance Interest Expense Weighted Average Interest Expense Rate Average Balance Interest Expense Weighted Average Interest Expense Rate Debt Facility 151,625,000 3,141,578 8.29 222,500,000 4,336,715 7.80 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 1.2 million, or 27.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased primarily due to lower average debt outstanding. The average outstanding balance for borrowings under the facility decreased by 70.9 million, or 31.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 The following table shows the average balance, interest expense, and weighted average interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Average Balance Interest Expense Weighted Average Interest Expense Rate Average Balance Interest Expense Weighted Average Interest Expense Rate Debt Facility 172,050,000 10,294,894 7.98 193,050,000 10,700,000 7.39 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 0.4 million, or 3.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased primarily due to lower average debt outstanding which was partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate. The average outstanding balance for borrowings under the facility decreased by 21.0 million, or 10.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Fund also uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates on its borrowings under the debt facility. See the discussion herein under the caption Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for the approximate annualized effect of hypothetical interest rate changes in components of net assets resulting from operations.

 Management Fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were both 2.0 million. Management Fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5.9 million and 6.0 million, respectively. For the period from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, Management Fees were calculated at 1.575 of the Company's committed capital. For the same period in 2023, Management Fees were calculated at an annual percentage of 1.600 of the Company's committed capital. 
 
 Banking and professional fees decreased by less than 0.1 million and increased by 0.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. These expenses included legal fees, tax preparation fees and other consulting and professional service fees. 
 
 Other operating expenses increased by less than 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Other operating expense included director fees, custody fees, taxes, insurance and other expenses related to the operations of the Fund. 
 
 Non-recurring fees 
 
 The Fund may receive non-recurring fees in connection with the origination and servicing of portfolio loans. Transactions in this category may include forfeited commitment fees and unamortized warrants that become recognized as other income after the loan commitment period expires. Other non-recurring fees include pre-payment fees which are recognized as other income in the period received. Legal fee reimbursements for deal due diligence and drafting of documents are recognized as offsets against legal expenses. Non-recurring fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were both 0.4 million. Non-recurring fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.9 million and 1.2 million, respectively. 
 
 Net Investment Income 
 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 13.9 million and 8.9 million, respectively. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 45.4 million and 25.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Realized and Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 
 There were no realized gains (losses) from loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Net realized gain from derivative instruments was less than 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no realized gains (losses) from derivative instruments for the same periods in 2023. Realized gains were the result of interest being received by the Fund on the derivative instruments when the cap rates of the interest rate collars were lower than the floating rate. 
 
 Net change in unrealized loss from loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.3 million and 6.3 million, respectively. Net change in unrealized loss from loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 17.9 million and 8.6 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized loss from loans consisted of fair value adjustments to the loans resulting from the deterioration in certain portfolio companies' performance. 
 
 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was less than (0.1) million and 0.1 million, respectively. There were no unrealized gains (losses) from derivative instruments for the same periods in 2023. The net change in unrealized gain (loss) from derivative instruments consisted of fair market value adjustments to the derivative instruments and is a reflection of the market s outlook on the economy and the future of interest rate changes, as well as realization of prior unrealized gains and losses. 
 
 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.5 million and 2.6 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 114.89 and 25.52, respectively. 
 
 42 

Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 27.6 million and 16.7 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 275.55 and 166.77, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 The Fund is owned entirely by the Company. The Company is expected, but not required, to make further contributions to the capital of the Fund to the extent of the Company s members capital commitment to the Company and excess cash balances of the Company. Total capital contributed to the Fund was 336.0 million and 276.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had subscriptions for capital in the amount of 500.0 million, of which 375.0 million and 305.0 million had been called and received. As of September 30, 2024, 125.0 million of capital remains uncalled and the uncalled capital expires on the Fund s fifth anniversary of its first investment unless extended. Management is permitted to extend the Fund s investment period by up to two (2) additional calendar quarters in its sole and absolute discretion. The Company has made 33.2 million in recallable distributions to its investors, as permitted under its operating agreement between the Company s managing member and members of the Company. 
 
 The changes in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (19,313,975) (97,691,795) Net cash provided by financing activities 31,757,597 112,958,920 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 12,443,622 15,267,125 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 10.33 and 7.58 , respectively, of the Fund s net assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 The Fund is a party to a loan and security agreement (as amended and restated from time to time) with ING Capital LLC acting as the administrative agent and other lenders named therein, that established a secured revolving credit facility with a commitment size of 250.0 million. An additional 125.0 million is potentially available to the Fund, subject to further negotiation and credit approval, through an accordion provision. 
 
 Borrowings by the Fund are collateralized by (i) the personal property and other assets of the Fund Portfolio Secured Borrowings and (ii) up to the sum of the unfunded capital commitments of the Company s investors, the rights of the Manager to such capital commitments Subscription Secured Borrowings ). The Fund pays interest on its borrowings and a fee on the unused portion of the facility. Borrowings under the facility, at the Fund s discretion, will bear interest at an annual rate of either a (i) Reference Rate, plus an Applicable Reference Rate Margin (such loan, a "Reference Rate Loan"), (ii) Adjusted Term SOFR plus the Applicable SOFR Margin (such loan, an "Adjusted Term SOFR Loan") or (iii) Daily Compounded SOFR plus the Applicable SOFR Margin (such loan, a "Daily Compounded SOFR Loan"). As of September 30, 2024, the Fund s outstanding borrowings were entirely Adjusted Term SOFR Loans. The interest period for each Adjusted Term SOFR Loan shall at the option of the Fund be fixed at one, three or six months. Adjusted Term SOFR is a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for the elected interest period plus a fixed SOFR Adjustment of 0.11448 , 0.26161 or 0.42826 for interest periods of one, three or six months, respectively. Applicable SOFR Margin is the sum of (a) the product of (i) the Subscription Secured Borrowings percentage calculated for such period and (ii) 1.75 and (b) the product of (i) the Portfolio Secured Borrowings percentage for such period and (ii) 2.50 . When the Fund is using 50.00 or more of the maximum amount available under the Loan Agreement, the applicable unused line fee is 0.25 of the unused portion of the loan facility; otherwise, the applicable unused line fee is 0.50 of the unused portion. The Fund pays the unused credit line fee quarterly. The facility terminates on October 18, 2026, but can be accelerated in the event of default, such as the failure by the Fund to make timely interest or principal payments. As of September 30, 2024, 176.5 million was outstanding under the facility. 
 
 Amounts disbursed under the Fund s loan commitments were 171.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net loan amounts outstanding after amortization and valuation adjustments decreased by 26.7 million for the same period. Unexpired unfunded commitments totaled 111.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of Cumulative Amount Disbursed Principal Reductions and Fair Market Adjustments Balance Outstanding - Fair Value Unexpired Unfunded Commitments September 30, 2024 724.0 million 293.7 million 430.3 million 111.3 million December 31, 2023 552.3 million 148.7 million 403.6 million 132.3 million 
 
 The unexpired unfunded commitments by portfolio company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are detailed in Note 10 to the financial statements included in this filing. 

43 

Because venture loans are privately negotiated transactions, investments in these assets are relatively illiquid. It is Management's experience that not all unexpired unfunded commitments will be used by borrowers. Many credit agreements contain provisions that are milestone dependent and not all borrowers will achieve these milestones. Additionally, the Fund s credit agreements contain provisions that give relief from funding obligations in the event the borrower has a materially adverse change in its financial condition. Therefore, the unexpired unfunded commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements or future investments for the Fund. 
 
 The Fund seeks to maintain the requirements to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Code, and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes to its shareholder. To qualify as a RIC, the Fund must distribute to its shareholder for each taxable year at least 90 of its investment company taxable income (consisting generally of net investment income and net short-term capital gain) (the Distribution Requirement ). To the extent that the terms of the Fund s venture loans provide for the receipt by the Fund of additional interest at the end of the loan term or provide for the receipt by the Fund of a purchase price for the asset at the end of the loan term residual income ), the Fund would be required to accrue such residual income over the life of the loan, and to include such accrued undistributed income in its gross income for each taxable year even if it receives no portion of such residual income in that year. Thus, in order to meet the Distribution Requirement and avoid payment of income taxes or an excise tax on undistributed income, the Fund may be required in a particular year to distribute as a dividend an amount in excess of the total amount of income it actually receives. Those distributions will be made from the Fund s cash assets, from amounts received through amortization of loans or from borrowed funds. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Fund had a cash balance of 29.7 million and 190.0 million in scheduled loan receivable payments over the next twelve months. Additionally, the Fund has access to uncalled capital of 125.0 million and recallable capital of 33.2 million as a liquidity source and a borrowing base that grows as it funds additional commitments. These amounts are sufficient to meet the current commitment backlog and operational expenses of the Fund over the next year. The Fund regularly evaluates potential future liquidity resources and demands before making additional future commitments. 
 
 On April 30, 2021, the Fund s sole shareholder, the Company, approved a reduced asset coverage ratio of 150 for the Fund as permitted in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Fund is permitted to borrow in any amount so long as its asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150 after giving effect to such borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the Fund s asset coverage ratio was 262 . 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Fund s business activities contain various elements of risk, of which Management considers interest rate and credit risk to be the principal types of risks. Because the Fund considers the management of risk essential to conducting its business and to maintaining profitability, the Fund s risk management procedures are designed to identify and analyze the Fund s risks, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. 
 
 The Fund manages its market risk by maintaining a portfolio that is diverse by industry, size of investment, stage of development, and borrower. The Fund has limited exposure to public market price fluctuations as the Fund primarily invests in private business enterprises and distributes all equity investments upon receipt to the Company. 
 
 The Fund s investments are subject to market risk based on several factors, including, but not limited to, the borrower s credit history, available cash, support of the borrower s underlying investors, available liquidity, burn rate, revenue income, security interest, secondary markets for collateral, the size of the loan, term of the loan and the ability to exit via initial public offering or merger and acquisition. 
 
 The Fund s exposure to interest rate sensitivity is regularly monitored and analyzed by measuring the characteristics of assets and liabilities. The Fund utilizes various methods to assess interest rate risk in terms of the potential effect on interest income net of interest expense, the value of net assets and the value at risk in an effort to ensure that the Fund is insulated from any significant adverse effects from changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding debt balance was 176.5 million with a floating interest rate based on a daily 1-month Adjusted Term SOFR rate of 4.8457 , for which the Fund had derivative instruments in place with a ceiling of 5.30 on 100.0 million with an interest rate collar, leaving the Fund with exposure to interest rate changes on the un-hedged portion of the loan. 
 
 Because all of the Fund s loans impose a fixed interest rate upon funding, changes in short-term interest rates will not directly affect interest income associated with the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. However, those changes could have the potential to change the Fund s ability to originate loan commitments, acquire and renew bank facilities, and engage in other investment activities. Further, changes in short-term interest rates could also affect interest rate expense, realized gain from investments and interest on the Fund s short-term investments. 

44 

Based on the Fund s Condensed Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase (decrease) in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in investments, borrowings, cash balances and derivative instruments. 
 
 Effect of Interest Rate Change By Increase (Decrease) Other Income Gain (Loss) from Interest Rate Collar (Increase) Decrease Interest Expense Increase (Decrease) in Total Income (2.00) (593,485) (1,000,000) 3,530,000 1,936,516 (1.00) (296,742) 1,765,000 1,468,258 (0.50) (148,371) 882,500 734,129 0.50 148,371 500,000 (882,500) (234,129) 1.00 296,742 1,000,000 (1,765,000) (468,258) 2.00 593,485 2,000,000 (3,530,000) (936,516) 
 
 Additionally, a change in the interest rate may affect the fair value of the derivative instruments and affect net change in unrealized gain or loss from derivative instruments. The amount of any such effect will be contingent upon market expectations for future interest rate changes. Any increases in expected future rates will increase the fair value of the derivative instruments while any rate decreases will decrease the fair value. 
 
 Although Management believes that the foregoing analysis is indicative of the Fund s sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not take into consideration potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in the portfolio. It also does not assume any new fundings to borrowers, repayments from borrowers or defaults on borrowings. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the table above. 
 
 Because the Fund currently borrows, its net investment income is highly dependent upon the difference between the rate at which it borrows and the rate at which it invests the amounts borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund s investment activities and net investment income. The Fund s exposure to movement in short-term interest rates stems from the Fund borrowing at a floating interest rate but then making loans with a fixed rate at the time the loans are extended. 
 
 The Fund is not sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and other market rates or prices.
