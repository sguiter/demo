HEP Merger 
 On December 1, 2023, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 15, 2023 (the Merger Agreement ), by and among HEP, HF Sinclair, Navajo Pipeline Co., L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HF Sinclair HoldCo ), Holly Apple Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo Merger Sub ), HEP Logistics Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and the general partner of HEP HLH ), and Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of HLH (the General Partner ), Merger Sub merged with and into HEP, with HEP surviving as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of HF Sinclair (the HEP Merger Transaction ). 
 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding common unit representing a limited partner interest in HEP (an HEP common unit ), other than the HEP common units already owned by HF Sinclair and its subsidiaries, was converted into the right to receive shares of HF Sinclair common stock and in cash, without interest. The Merger Agreement consideration totaled million in cash and resulted in the issuance of shares of HF Sinclair common stock from treasury stock. 
 
 The HEP Merger Transaction was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC 810, Consolidation. Since we controlled HEP both before and after the HEP Merger Transaction, the changes in our ownership interest in HEP resulting from the HEP Merger Transaction were accounted for as an equity transaction, and no gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. The tax effects of the HEP Merger Transaction were recorded as adjustments to Deferred income taxes and Additional capital consistent with ASC 740, Income Taxes. 
 
 For a description of our existing indebtedness, as well as associated changes in connection with the HEP Merger Transaction, see Note 11.

 barrel per day common carrier crude oil pipeline (the Cushing Connect Pipeline that connects the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil hub to our Tulsa refineries and (ii) the ownership and operation of million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing, Oklahoma (the Cushing Connect Terminal ). Cushing Connect entered into a contract with an affiliate of HEP, now a subsidiary of HF Sinclair, to manage the operation of the Cushing Connect Pipeline and with an affiliate of Plains to manage the operation of the Cushing Connect Terminal. The total investment in Cushing Connect was generally shared proportionately among the partners. However, HEP was solely responsible for any Cushing Connect Pipeline construction costs that exceeded the budget by more than . 
 
 Cushing Connect and its two subsidiaries (the Cushing Connect Entities ), are variable interest entities VIE as defined under GAAP. A VIE is a legal entity whose equity owners do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the equity holders lack the power, through voting rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s financial performance, the obligation to absorb the entity s expected losses or rights to expected residual returns. The Cushing Connect Entities are VIEs because they did not originally have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional financial support. We are the primary beneficiary of two of these entities as HEP constructed and operates the Cushing Connect Pipeline, and we have more ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the financial performance of Cushing Connect and the Cushing Connect Pipeline. Therefore, we consolidate Cushing Connect and the related Cushing Connect Pipeline subsidiary. We are not the primary beneficiary of the Cushing Connect Terminal, which we account for using the equity method of accounting. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with Cushing Connect Terminal is not expected to be material due to the long-term terminalling agreements in place to support operations.

 million compared to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Our effective tax rates were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the relationship between pre-tax results and non-taxable permanent differences. The difference in the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the impact of federal tax credits and the relationship between pre-tax results and the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest that is not included in income for tax purposes.

 HF Sinclair Financing Arrangements 
 Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into financing arrangements whereby such subsidiaries sold a portion of their precious metals catalyst to a financial institution in exchange for cash and then financed the use of the precious metals catalyst for a term not to exceed one year. The volume of the precious metals catalyst and the interest rate are fixed over the term of each agreement, and the payments are recorded as Interest expense . Upon maturity of the financing arrangement, we must either satisfy the obligation at fair market value or refinance to extend the maturity. These financing arrangements are recorded at a Level 2 fair value totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in Accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This Item 2 contains forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, this Item 2 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Exhibit 99.1 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed May 8, 2024. In this document, the words we, our, ours, and us refer only to HF Sinclair Corporation HF Sinclair and its consolidated subsidiaries or to HF Sinclair or an individual subsidiary and not to any other person with certain exceptions. References herein to Holly Energy Partners, L.P. HEP with respect to time periods prior to the closing of the HEP Merger Transaction (as defined below) on December 1, 2023, refer to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are an independent energy company that produces and markets high-value light products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, renewable diesel and lubricants and other specialty products. We own and operate refineries located in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Wyoming, Washington and Utah. We provide petroleum product and crude oil transportation, terminalling, storage and throughput services to our refineries and the petroleum industry. We market our refined products principally in the Southwest United States, the Rocky Mountains extending into the Pacific Northwest and in other neighboring Plains states, and we supply high-quality fuels to more than 1,500 branded stations and license the use of the Sinclair brand at more than 300 additional locations throughout the country. We produce renewable diesel at two of our facilities in Wyoming and our facility in New Mexico. In addition, our subsidiaries produce and market base oils and other specialized lubricants in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands, and export products to more than 80 countries. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Net loss attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders was (75.9) million com pared to a Net income attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders of 790.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net income attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders was 390.5 million compared to 1,651.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In the Refining segment, we continued to see lower refining margins in the West region in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior two quarters, principally as a result of high global supply of transportation fuels across the industry that continues to weigh on product margins. Additionally, we completed the planned turnaround at our Parco refinery and began a planned turnaround at our El Dorado refinery during the period. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to run between 565,000-600,000 barrels per day of crude oil, which reflects the planned turnaround at our El Dorado refinery. 
 
 In the Renewables segment, we continued to see increased sales volumes and feedstock optimization despite ongoing weakness in RINs and Low Carbon Fuel Standard LCFS prices in the third quarter of 2024. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect continued weakness in RINs and LCFS prices to impact renewable diesel margins. 
 
 In the Marketing segment, we continued to see strong value in the Sinclair branded sites during the third quarter of 2024 as the marketing business continued to provide a consistent sales channel with margin uplift for our produced fuels. We expect to grow the number of branded sites by approximately 10 over the next six to twelve months. 
 
 In the Lubricants Specialties segment, we continued to see strong performance (excluding first-in, first out FIFO impacts), driven by increased sales volumes, sales mix optimization and base oil integration across our portfolio during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 In the Midstream segment, our results continued to benefit from increased sales volumes and higher tariffs in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 We continue to adjust our operational plans to evolving market conditions. The extent to which our future results are affected by volatile regional and global economic conditions will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control.

 In August 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.0 billion share repurchase program, and we continued to repurchase shares in the first and second quarter of 2024 under this program. On May 7, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new 1.0 billion share repurchase program (the May 2024 Share Repurchase Program ), and we continued to repurchase shares this quarter under the May 2024 Share Repurchase Program. The timing and amount of share repurchases under the May 2024 Share Repurchase Program, including those from REH Company REH Company and together with its affiliate REH Advisors Inc., REH ), will depend on market conditions and corporate, tax, regulatory and other relevant conditions. We repurchased 2,665,000 and 11,944,177 shares for 126.5 million and 663.7 million through the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, under open market and privately negotiated purchases.

 Renewable Fuel Standard Regulations 
 Pursuant to the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard RFS regulations, which increased the volume of renewable fuels mandated to be blended into the nation s fuel supply. The regulations, in part, require refiners to add annually increasing amounts of renewable fuels to their petroleum products or purchase credits, known as RINs, in lieu of such blending. Compliance with RFS regulations significantly increases our Cost of materials and other , with RINs costs totaling 119.4 million and 333.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 237.8 million and 596.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, our open RINs credit obligations wer e 27.5 million .

Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Summary 
 Net loss attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was (75.9) million (0.40) per basic and diluted share), a 866.9 million decrease compared to Net income attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders of 790.9 million 4.23 per basic and diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was principally driven by lower adjusted refinery gross margins in both the West and Mid-Continent regions, partially offset by higher refined product sales volumes. Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments related to our refining and renewables Inventories decreased pre-tax earnings by 202.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased pre-tax earnings by 43.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted refinery gross margins for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 10.79 per produced barrel sold as compared to 26.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Sales and Other Revenues 
 Sales and other revenues decreased 19.1 from 8,905.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 7,207.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, principally due to lower refined product sales prices, partially offset by higher refined product sales volumes. Sales and other revenues included 950.1 million, 682.6 million, 27.8 million and 160.0 million in unaffiliated revenues related to our Marketing, Lubricants Specialties, Midstream and Renewables segments, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Adjusted Refinery Gross Margins 
 Adjusted refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold decreased 59 from 26.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 10.79 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due to lower average sales prices per barrel, partially offset by lower crude oil and feedstock prices during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold does not include the non-cash effects of Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments , which relate to volumes in inventory at the end of the period, Operating expenses , and Depreciation and amortization .

 Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of 57.3 million compared to 235.0 million of tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was principally due to decreased earnings during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023 . Our effective tax rates were 43.6 and 22.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to the relationship between pre-tax results and non-taxable permanent differences. The difference in the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the impa ct of federal tax credits and the relationship between pre-tax results and the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest that is not included in income for tax purposes.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 HF Sinclair and HEP Credit Agreements 
 We have a 1.65 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility m aturing in April 2026 (the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement ). The HF Sinclair Credit Agreement may be used for revolving credit loans and letters of credit from time to time and is available to fund general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants, had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit totaling 0.2 million un der the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement. 
 
 Additionally, our wholly owned subsidiary, HEP, has a 1.2 billion seni or secured revolving credit facility maturing in July 2025 (the HEP Credit Agreement and, together with the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreements ). In connection with the consummation of the HEP Merger Transaction, we amended the HEP Credit Agreement to, among other things, (a) provide a guaranty from us and terminate all guaranties from subsidiaries of HEP, (b) amend the definition of Investment Grade Rating (as defined in the HEP Credit Agreement) to reference the credit rating of our senior unsecured indebtedness, (c) eliminate the requirement to deliver separate audited and unaudited financial statements for HEP and its subsidiaries and only provide certain segment-level reporting for HEP with any compliance certificate delivered in accordance with the HEP Credit Agreement and (d) amend certain covenants to eliminate certain restrictions on (i) amendments to intercompany contracts, (ii) transactions with us and our subsidiaries and (iii) investments in and contributions, dividends, transfers and distributions to us and our subsidiaries. 
 
 The HEP Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments, working capital and for general corporate purposes. It is also available to fund letters of credit up to a 50 million sub-limit and has an accordion feature that allows us to increase the commitments under the HEP Credit Agreement up to a maximum amount of 1.7 billion. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of its covenants, had outstanding borrowings of 350.0 million an d no outstanding letters of credit under the HEP Credit Agreement. 
 
 Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements bears interest, at our option, for borrowings in U.S. dollars at either (a) a base rate equal to the sum of (1) the highest of (i) the prime rate (as publicly announced from time to time by the applicable administrative agent), (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement and as defined as the Federal Funds Rate in the HEP Credit Agreement) plus 0.5 , and (iii) Spread Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement and as defined as Adjusted Term SOFR in the HEP Credit Agreement) for a one-month interest period plus 1 , plus (2) an applicable margin for base rate loans ranging from 0.25 to 1.125 , or (b) the sum of (1) Spread Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement and as defined as Adjusted Term SOFR in the HEP Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period, plus (2) an applicable margin for term SOFR loans ranging from 1.25 to 2.125 . The HF Sinclair Credit Agreement allows for borrowings in Sterling and Euros with similar interest rates. In each case and each Credit Agreement, the applicable margin is based on HF Sinclair s debt rating assigned by Standard Poor s Rating Services and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. The weighted average interest rate in effect under the HEP Credit Agreement on our borrowings was 6.58 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments of 105.5 million under the HEP Credit Agreement. 
 
 Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes Exchange 
 On December 4, 2023, we completed our offers to exchange any and all outstanding HEP 5.000 senior notes maturing February 2028 (the HEP 5.000 Senior Notes and HEP 6.375 senior notes maturing April 2027 (the HEP 6.375 Senior Notes and, together with the HEP 5.000 Senior Notes, the HEP Senior Notes for HF Sinclair 5.000 senior notes maturing February 2028 (the HF Sinclair 5.000 Senior Notes and HF Sinclair 6.375 senior notes maturing April 2027 (the HF Sinclair 6.375 Senior Notes and, together with the HF Sinclair 5.000 Senior Notes, the Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes to be issued by HF Sinclair with registration rights and cash. In connection with the exchange offers, we amended the indenture governing the HEP Senior Notes to eliminate (i) substantially all of the restrictive covenants, (ii) certain of the events which may lead to an Event of Default, (iii) the SEC reporting covenant and (iv) the requirement of HEP to offer to purchase the HEP Senior Notes upon a change of control. The Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes were issued in exchange for the HEP Senior Notes pursuant to a private exchange offer exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). This exchange was part of a broader corporate strategy, including the HEP Merger Transaction. 
 
 On May 10, 2024, HF Sinclair filed a registration statement, as amended, which was declared effective on August 5, 2024, to exchange the Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes for an equal principal amount of each respective series of the Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes (such notes offered in exchange, the Registered HF Sinclair Senior Notes ). The Registered HF Sinclair Senior Notes are substantially identical to the Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes in all material respects except the Registered

Table of Contents 

 HF Sinclair Senior Notes are registered under the Securities Act and are not subject to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate for failure to comply with the Registration Rights Agreement, dated December 4, 2023, and do not have the registration rights applicable to the Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes. On September 5, 2024, HF Sinclair completed its offers to exchange the Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes for the Registered HF Sinclair Senior Notes. 
 
 The Registered HF Sinclair Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Each series of the Registered HF Sinclair Senior Notes has the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as the corresponding series of Restricted HF Sinclair Senior Notes. 
 
 HF Sinclair Financing Arrangements 
 Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into financing arrangements whereby such subsidiaries sold a portion of their precious metals catalyst to a financial institution in exchange for cash and then financed the use of the precious metals catalyst for a term not to exceed one year. The volume of the precious metals catalyst and the interest rate are fixed over the term of each agreement, and the payments are recorded as Interest expense . Upon maturity of the financing arrangement, we must either satisfy the obligation at fair market value or refinance to extend the maturity. 
 
 HF Sinclair may, from time to time, issue letters of credit pursuant to uncommitted letters of credit facilities with its lenders. At September 30, 2024, there were no letters of credit outstanding under such credit facilities. 
 
 See Note 11 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt instruments. 
 
 Liquidity 
 We believe our current Cash and cash equivalents , along with future internally generated cash flow and funds available under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient resources to fund currently planned capital projects and our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets. Further, we may, from time to time, seek to retire some or all of our outstanding debt agreements through cash purchases, and/or exchanges, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, may be material and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. In addition, components of our long-term growth strategy include the optimization of existing units at our facilities and the selective acquisition of complementary assets for our operations intended to increase earnings and cash flow. We also expect to use cash for payment of cash dividends, which are at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and for the repurchase of common stock under the May 2024 Share Repurchase Program. 
 
 Our liquidity was approximately 3.7 billion at September 30, 2024, consisting of Cash and cash equivalents o f 1.2 billion, an undra wn 1.65 billion credit facility under the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement and 850.0 million remaining availability under the HEP Credit Agreement. 
 
 We consider all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These primarily consist of investments in conservative, highly rated instruments issued by financial institutions, government and corporate entities with strong credit standings and money market funds. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. 
 
 On May 7, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the May 2024 Share Repurchase Program, which replaced all existing share repurchase programs, including the approximately 214.2 million remaining under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in August 2023 (the August 2023 Share Repurchase Program . The May 2024 Share Repurchase Program authorizes us to repurchase common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Privately negotiated repurchases from REH are also authorized under the May 2024 Share Repurchase Program, subject to REH s interest in selling its shares and other limitations. The timing and amount of share repurchases, including those from REH, will depend on market conditions and corporate, tax, regulatory and other relevant considerations. In addition, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase shares in an amount sufficient to offset shares issued under our compensation programs. The May 2024 Share Repurchase Program may be discontinued at any time by our Board of Directors.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made open market and privately negotiated purchases of 4,013,435 shares for 201.5 million under the May 2024 Share Repurchase Program, of which 1,348,435 shares were repurchased for 75.0 million pursuant to privately negotiated repurchases from REH Company. 
 
 Cash Flows Operating Activities 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 1,250.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,066.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 816.2 million primarily driven by a decrease in net income, partially offset by changes in working capital combined with lower turnaround spend during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in working capital increased operating ca sh flows by 545.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and increased operating cash flows by 144.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Turnaround expenditures were 258.8 million compared to 471.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows Investing Activities and Planned Capital Expenditures 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Net cash flows used for investing activities were 294.6 million. Cash expenditures for Properties, plants and equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 296.9 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our Net cash flows used for investing activities were 247.7 million. Cash expenditures for Properties, plants and equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were 261.4 million. 
 
 Each year, our Board of Directors approves our annual capital budget, which includes specific projects that management is authorized to undertake. When conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise, additional projects may be approved. The funds appropriated for a particular capital project may be expended over a period of several years, depending on the time required to complete the project. Therefore, our planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures appropriated in that year s capital budget plus expenditures for projects appropriated in prior years that have not yet been completed. Refinery turnaround spending is amortized over the useful life of the turnaround. 
 
 The refining industry is capital-intensive and requires ongoing investments to sustain our refining operations. This includes the replacement of, or rebuilding, refinery units and components that extend their useful life. We also invest in projects that improve operational reliability and profitability via enhancements that improve refinery processing capabilities as well as production yield and flexibility. Our capital expenditures also include projects related to renewable diesel, environmental, health and safety compliance and include initiatives as a result of federal and state mandates. 
 
 Our refinery operations and related emissions are highly regulated at both federal and state levels, and we invest in our facilities as needed to remain in compliance with these standards. Additionally, when faced with new emissions or fuel standards, we seek to execute projects that facilitate compliance and also improve the operating costs and/or yields of associated refining processes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain critical accounting policies that materially affect the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements include assessing the possible impairment of certain Assets and Goodwill and assessing contingent liabilities for probable losses.

 Goodwill and Asset Impairments 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Goodwill balance was 3.0 billion, with goodwill assigned to our Refining, Renewables, Marketing, Lubricants Specialties and Midstream segments. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our goodwill impairment testing first entails either a quantitative assessment or an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that based on the qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a quantitative test is performed in which we estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired, and we measure goodwill impairment as the excess of the carrying amount of reporting unit over the related fair value. 
 
 We performed our annual goodwill impairment testing quantitatively as of July 1, 2024, and determined there was no impairment of goodwill attributable to our reporting units. The estimated fair values of our reporting units were derived using a combination of income and market approaches. The income approach reflects expected future cash flows based on estimated forecasted production levels, selling prices, gross margins, operating costs and capital expenditures. Our market approaches include both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Both methods utilize pricing multiples derived from historical market transactions and other market data of other like-kind assets. The fair values of the reporting units over their respective carrying values exceeded 10 . Increasing the discount rate by 1.0 or reducing the terminal cash flow growth rate by 1.0 would not have changed the results of our annual goodwill testing. 
 
 In performing our impairment test of goodwill, we developed cash flow forecasts for each of our reporting units. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information. The cash flow forecasts include significant assumptions such as planned utilization, end-user demand, selling prices, gross margins, operating costs and capital expenditures. Other key assumptions applied to these forecasts to determine the fair value of a reporting unit are the discount rate and terminal cash flow growth rate. The discount rate is intended to reflect the weighted average cost of capital for a market participant and the risks associated with the realization of the estimated future cash flows. Our fair value estimates are based on projected cash flows, which we believe to be reasonable. 
 
 We continually monitor and evaluate various factors for potential indicators of goodwill and asset impairments. A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in our operating results or overall economic conditions could lead to goodwill and / or asset impairments at some point in the future. Future impairment charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Contingencies 
 We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, labor, product and other matters. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy when dealing with these matters. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 We use certain strategies to reduce some commodity price and operational risks. We do not attempt to eliminate all market risk exposures when we believe that the exposure relating to such risk would not be significant to our future earnings, financial position, capital resources or liquidity or that the cost of eliminating the exposure would outweigh the benefit. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk Management 
 Our primary market risk is commodity price risk. We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in crude oil and refined products, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. We periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of commodity price swaps, collar contracts, forward purchase and sales and futures contracts to mitigate price exposure with respect to our inventory positions, natural gas purchases, sales prices of refined products and crude oil costs. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk Management 
 We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exposure associated with fluctuations on intercompany notes with our foreign subsidiaries that are not denominated in the U.S. dollar.

As of September 30, 2024, we have the following notional contract volumes related to all outstanding derivative instruments used to mitigate commodity price and foreign currency risk:

 (1) Represents an embedded derivative within our precious metals catalyst financing arrangements, which may be refinanced or require repayment under certain conditions. See Note 11 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these financing arrangements. 
 
 The following sensitivity analysis provides the hypothetical effects of market price fluctuations to the commodity hedged under our derivative contracts: 
 Derivative Fair Value Gain (Loss) at September 30, 
 2024 2023 (In thousands) 10 increase in underlying commodity prices (9,649) (10,387) 10 decrease in underlying commodity prices 9,649 10,178 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 
 The market risk inherent in our fixed-rate debt is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates, as discussed below. 
 
 For the fixed rate HF Sinclair Senior Notes, HollyFrontier Senior Notes and HEP Senior Notes (each as set forth in Note 11 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), changes in interest rates will generally affect the fair value of the debt, but not earnings or cash flows. The outstanding principal, estimated fair value and estimated change in fair value (assuming a hypothetical 10 change in the yield-to-maturity rates) for this debt as of September 30, 2024, is presented below: 
 Outstanding Principal Estimated Fair Value Estimated Change in Fair Value 
 (In thousands) HollyFrontier Corporation, HF Sinclair and HEP Senior Notes 2,300,000 2,310,949 30,216 
 
 For the variable rate HF Sinclair Credit Agreement and HEP Credit Agreement, changes in interest rates would affect cash flows, but not the fair value. At September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the HEP Credit Agreement were 350.0 million, and no borrowings were outstanding under the HF Sinclair Credit Agreement. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates applicable to the HEP Credit Agreement would not materially affect cash flows. 
 
 Our operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, including but not limited to fire, explosion, releases or spills, cyberattacks, weather-related perils, vandalism, power failures, mechanical failures and other events beyond our control. We maintain various insurance coverages, including general liability, property damage, business interruption and cyber insurance, which are subject to certain deductibles and insurance policy terms and conditions. We are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable, coverage is unavailable, or premium costs, in our judgment, do not justify such expenditures. 
 
 Financial information is reviewed on the counterparties in order to review and monitor their financial stability and assess their ongoing ability to honor their commitments under the derivative contracts. We have not experienced, nor do we expect to experience, any difficulty in the counterparties honoring their commitments. 
 
 We have a risk management oversight committee consisting of members from our senior management. This committee oversees our risk enterprise program, monitors our risk environment and provides direction for activities to mitigate identified risks that may adversely affect the achievement of our goals.

 Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 
 Reconciliations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements. 
 
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA, is calculated as Net income (loss) attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders plus (i) Interest expense , net of Interest income , (ii) Income tax expense (benefit) , and (iii) Depreciation and amortization . EBITDA is not a calculation provided for under GAAP; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) or Income (loss) from operations as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA is presented here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA is also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants. 
 
 Below is our calculation of EBITDA:

 Reconciliations of refinery operating information (non-GAAP performance measures) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements. 
 
 Adjusted refinery gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that is used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry. We believe this margin measure is helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis, including against publicly available crack spread data. Adjusted refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold is total Refining segment gross margin plus Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments , Depreciation and amortization and Operating expenses , divided by sales volumes of produced refined products sold. This margin measure does not include the non-cash effects of Lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments , which relate to volumes in inventory at the end of the period. Adjusted refinery gross margin is not a calculation provided for under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Refining segment gross margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted refinery gross margin is Refining segment gross margin. Other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same manner. Due to rounding of reported numbers, some amounts may not calculate exactly.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Commitment and Contingency Reserves 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may become party to legal, regulatory or administrative proceedings or governmental investigations, including environmental and other matters. Damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters and certain matters may require years to resolve. While the outcome and impact of these proceedings and investigations on us cannot be predicted with certainty, based on advice of counsel and information currently available to us, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings and investigations through settlement or adverse judgment will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 The environmental proceedings are reported to comply with SEC regulations which require us to disclose proceedings arising under provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or protecting the environment when a governmental authority is party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe could exceed 300,000 or more. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 Navajo 
 HF Sinclair Navajo Refining LLC HFS Navajo has been engaged in discussions with, and has responded to document requests from, the EPA, the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ and the New Mexico Environment Department (the NMED (collectively, the Navajo Matter Government Agencies regarding HFS Navajo s compliance with the Clean Air Act CAA and underlying regulations, and similar New Mexico laws and regulations, at its Artesia and Lovington, New Mexico refineries. The discussions have included the following topics: (a) alleged noncompliance with CAA s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants NESHAP and New Source Performance Standards NSPS at the Artesia refinery, which were set forth in a Notice of Violation May 2020 NOV issued by the EPA in May 2020; (b) a Post Inspection Notice issued in June 2020 by the NMED, alleging noncompliance issues similar to those alleged by the EPA in its May 2020 NOV as well as alleged noncompliance with the State Implementation Plan SIP and the Title V permit operating programs; (c) an information request issued in September 2020 by the EPA, pursuant to CAA Section 114, related to benzene fenceline monitoring, flare fuel gas, leak detection and repair, storage vessels and tanks, and other information regarding the Artesia refinery; (d) an information request issued by the EPA in May 2021, pursuant to CAA Section 114, requesting additional information and testing related to certain tanks at the Artesia refinery; and (e) informal information requests related to, among other things, the Artesia refinery s wastewater treatment plant, oil water separators and heat exchangers. In each of April 2022, June 2023 and August 2023, the EPA alleged additional CAA noncompliance at the Artesia refinery beyond the allegations in the May 2020 NOV, including alleged noncompliance with NESHAP, NSPS, SIP, Title V and other requirements. 
 
 Beginning in the spring of 2021, HFS Navajo and the Navajo Matter Government Agencies began monthly meetings to discuss potential injunctive relief measures to address the alleged noncompliance at the Artesia refinery. In September 2021 and August 2023, the EPA presented to HFS Navajo potential claims for alleged noncompliance with a 2002 consent decree. In September 2024, the Navajo Matter Government Agencies presented to HFS Navajo a proposed penalty demand for the alleged noncompliance at the Artesia refinery. HFS Navajo continues to assess the factual basis for the alleged noncompliance and the proposed penalty demand and continues to engage in work with the Navajo Matter Government Agencies to resolve these issues. 
 
 It is too early to predict the outcome of this matter or the timing of resolution. We are unable to estimate the costs we may incur, if any, at this time.

 HFS Puget Sound continues to work with the PSR Matter Government Agencies to resolve these issues. 
 
 At this time, no penalties have been demanded, and it is too early to predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Renewable Fuel Standard 
 
 On April 7, 2022, the EPA issued a decision reversing the grant of small refinery exemptions for our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2018 compliance year. On June 3, 2022, the EPA issued a decision reversing the grant of small refinery exemptions for our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2016 compliance year and denying small refinery exemption petitions for our Woods Cross and Cheyenne refineries for the 2019 and 2020 compliance years. 
 
 Certain of our subsidiaries pursued legal challenges to the EPA s decisions to deny small refinery exemptions for the 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020 compliance years. The first lawsuit, filed against the EPA on May 6, 2022, before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit (the DC Circuit ), sought to have the EPA s reversal of our 2018 small refinery exemption petitions overturned. The second lawsuit, filed against the EPA on August 5, 2022, before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, sought to have the EPA s reversal of our 2016 small refinery exemption petitions overturned and to have the EPA s denial of our 2019 and 2020 small refinery exemption petitions reversed. 
 
 In addition, for both the 2016 and 2018 compliance years, pursuant to the June 2022 and April 2022 decisions, respectively, the EPA established an alternative compliance demonstration for small refineries pursuant to which the EPA is not imposing any obligations for the small refineries whose exemptions were reversed. On June 24, 2022, Growth Energy filed two lawsuits in the DC Circuit against the EPA challenging the alternative compliance demonstration for the 2016 and 2018 compliance years. On July 25, 2022, certain of our subsidiaries intervened on behalf of the EPA to aid the defense of the EPA s alternative compliance demonstration decision. 
 
 On July 26, 2024, the DC Circuit issued a favorable decision vacating the EPA s denial of all of our small refinery exemption petitions, finding the denial to be unlawful. The DC Circuit remanded the small refinery exemption petitions to the EPA for new determination. The DC Circuit also upheld the alternative compliance demonstration and denied Growth Energy s challenge. 
 
 It is too early to determine the final impact of the DC Circuit s decisions. 
 
 Other 
 
 We are a party to various other litigation and proceedings that we believe, based on the advice of counsel, will not either individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
