Disaggregation of Revenue Our consolidated 2024 revenue was derived from contracts to provide service activities in the mechanical and electrical segments we serve. Refer to Note 11 Segment Information for additional information on our reportable segments. We disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by activity, customer type and service provided, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

We did t have any impairment losses recognized on our receivables or contract assets in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining construction performance obligations represent the remaining transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed and exclude unexercised contract options. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was billion. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately - of the remaining performance obligations over the next , with the remaining recognized thereafter. Our service maintenance agreements are generally renewable agreements. We have adopted the practical expedient that allows us to not include service maintenance contracts with a total term of year or less; therefore, we do not report unfulfilled performance obligations for service maintenance agreements.

 Contingent earn-out obligations Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Cash and cash equivalents Life insurance cash surrender value Contingent earn-out obligations Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of deposit accounts and highly rated money market funds at a variety of well-known institutions with original maturities of three months or less. The original cost of these assets approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity. We believe the carrying value of our debt associated with our revolving credit facility approximates its fair value due to the variable rate on such debt. We believe the carrying values of our notes to former owners approximate their fair values due to the relatively short remaining terms on these notes. As of December 31, 2023, we had life insurance policies covering employees with a combined face value of million. The policies are invested in several investment vehicles, and the fair value measurement of the cash surrender balance associated with these policies is determined using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy and will vary with investment performance. The cash surrender value of these policies is included in Other Noncurrent Assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We value contingent earn-out obligations using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method. This fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreements e.g. , minimum and maximum payments, length of earn-out periods, manner of calculating any amounts due, etc.) and utilizes assumptions with regard to future cash flows and operating income, probabilities of achieving such future cash flows and operating income and a weighted average cost of capital. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower potential liability. The contingent earn-out obligations are measured at fair value each reporting period, and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2024, cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital ranging from to . Issuances Settlements ) ) Adjustments to fair value Balance at end of period

 The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is preliminary and, therefore, subject to change pending the completion of the final valuation of intangible assets and accrued liabilities. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that cannot be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill recognized as a result of the Summit acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. In estimating the fair value of the acquired intangible assets, we utilized the valuation methodology determined to be the most appropriate for the individual intangible asset. In order to estimate the fair value of the backlog and customer relationships, we utilized an excess earnings methodology, which consisted of the projected cash flows attributable to these assets discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate that represented the required rate of return. The trade name value was determined based on the relief-from-royalty method, which applies a royalty rate to the revenue stream attributable to this asset, and the resulting royalty payment is tax effected and discounted to present value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets are associated with forecasting cash flows and profitability, which represent Level 3 inputs. The primary assumptions used were generally based upon the present value of anticipated cash flows discounted at rates ranging from to .

Cash flows were discounted using discount rates ranging from to , which we believe is appropriate and representative of a market participant assumption. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the contingent earn-out obligation is remeasured at fair value each reporting period. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent payments subsequent to the acquisition date are recognized immediately in earnings. J S Mechanical Contractors, Inc. Acquisition On February 1, 2024, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of J S Mechanical Contractors, Inc. J S ). J S is headquartered in West Jordan, Utah, and provides mechanical construction services to commercial and industrial sectors, specializing in data center HVAC systems and hospital medical gas systems. As a result of the acquisition, J S is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company reported in our mechanical segment.

 The contingent earn-out obligation is associated with the achievement of earnings milestones over a 35-month period, and the range of each estimated milestone payment is million to million. We determined the initial fair value of the contingent earn-out obligation based on the Monte Carlo Simulation method, which represents a Level 3 measurement.

Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent payments subsequent to the acquisition date are recognized immediately in earnings. Other Acquisitions On May 1, 2024, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of a plumbing service provider in North Carolina for a total preliminary purchase price of million, which is reported in our mechanical segment. On October 2, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of DECCO, Inc. DECCO ), headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire, for a total purchase price of million, which included million of cash paid on the closing date, million in notes payable to the former owners, an earn-out that will be paid if certain financial targets are met after the acquisition date and a working capital adjustment. DECCO operates in the Northeastern region of the United States and performs mechanical and plumbing services with specialties in piping systems, steam, power, biotechnical processes and conveying systems, in addition to turnkey tool and equipment installation, critical equipment handling services and associated maintenance and support services. As a result of the acquisition, DECCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company reported in our mechanical segment. On February 1, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Eldeco, Inc. Eldeco ), headquartered in South Carolina, for a total purchase price of million, which included million of cash paid on the closing date, million in notes payable to the former owners, an earn-out that will be paid if certain financial targets are met after the acquisition date and a working capital adjustment. Eldeco performs electrical design and construction services in the Southeastern region of the United States. As a result of the acquisition, Eldeco is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company reported in our electrical segment. The results of operations of acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes preliminary allocations of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the applicable acquisitions pending the completion of the final valuation of intangible assets and accrued liabilities. The acquisitions completed in the current and prior year were not material, individually or in the aggregate. Additional contingent purchase price earn-out has been or will be paid if certain acquisitions achieve predetermined profitability targets. Such earn-outs, when they are not subject to the continued employment of the sellers, are estimated as of the purchase date and included as part of the consideration paid for the acquisition. If we have an earn-out under which continued employment is a condition to receipt of payment, then the earn-out is recorded as compensation expense over the period earned.

The Facility also provides for an accordion or increase option not to exceed the greater of (a) million and (b) 1.0x Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), as well as a sublimit of up to million issuable in the form of letters of credit. The Facility expires in July 2027 and is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our personal property except for assets related to projects subject to surety bonds and the equity of, and assets held by, certain unrestricted subsidiaries and our wholly owned captive insurance company, and a second lien on our assets related to projects subject to surety bonds. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility, million in letters of credit outstanding and million of credit available. There are two interest rate options for borrowings under the Facility, the Base Rate Loan (as defined in the Facility) option and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR Loan option. These rates are floating rates 

 17 

Table of Contents 
 SOFR Loan Option There were outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. We have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts. Our lenders issue such letters of credit through the Facility. A letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the lenders for amounts they fund to honor the letter of credit holder s claim. Absent a claim, there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit. However, because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders, letters of credit are treated as a use of Facility capacity. The letter of credit fees range from to per annum, based on the Net Leverage Ratio. Commitment fees are payable on the portion of the revolving loan capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time. These fees range from to per annum, based on the Net Leverage Ratio. The Facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply. Covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarter end. We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. Notes to Former Owners As part of the consideration used to acquire companies, we have outstanding notes to the former owners. Together, these notes had an outstanding balance of million as of September 30, 2024. - 2026 - 2027 2028 Total F million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 million and million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenses were primarily related to short-term equipment rentals. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The weighted average discount rate for our operating leases as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively. We recognize operating lease expense, including escalating lease payments and lease incentives, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. Operating lease expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. The lease terms generally range from three to . Some leases include or options to renew, which may be exercised to extend the lease term. We include the exercise of lease renewal options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option and such exercise is at our sole discretion. In the third quarter of 2023, we commenced large real estate leases to support our expected growth in off-site construction, with lease terms longer than our typical terms. The weighted average remaining lease term for our operating leases was years at September 30, 2024 and years at December 31, 2023. A majority of the Company s real property leases are with individuals or entities with whom we have no other business relationship. However, in certain instances the Company enters into real property leases with current or former employees. Rent paid to related parties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. Rent paid to related parties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. If we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. On rare occasions, we rent or sublease certain real estate assets that we no longer use to third parties.

 Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities million from legal developments and settlements that primarily relate to disputes with customers regarding the outcome of completed projects as well as an obligation to perform subcontract work under two executed letters of intent for subsequent projects that we believed were not enforceable. The pre-tax gain of million was recorded as an increase in gross profit of million, a reduction in SG A of million, an increase in interest income of million and an increase in the change in fair value of contingent earn-out obligations expense of million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded an accrual for unresolved matters, which is not material to our financial statements, based on our analysis of likely outcomes related to the respective matters; however, it is possible that the ultimate outcome and associated costs will deviate from our estimates and that, in the event of an unexpectedly adverse outcome, we may experience additional costs and expenses in future periods. Surety Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. If we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Current market conditions for surety markets and bonding capacity are adequate, with acceptable terms and conditions. Historically, approximately to of our business has required bonds. While we currently have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs, future market conditions or changes in the sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause the sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work. If that were to occur, the alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds, posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash, and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties. We would likely also encounter concerns from customers, suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness. While we believe our general operating and financial characteristics would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity, such an interruption would likely cause our revenue and profits to decline in the near term. Self-Insurance We are substantially self-insured for workers compensation, employer s liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims, in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Losses are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry

The terms Comfort Systems, we, us, or the Company, refer to Comfort Systems USA, Inc. or Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as appropriate in the context. Introduction and Overview We are a national provider of comprehensive mechanical and electrical installation, renovation, maintenance, repair and replacement services within the mechanical and electrical services industries. We operate primarily in the commercial, industrial and institutional markets and perform most of our work in manufacturing, healthcare, education, office, technology, retail and government facilities. We operate our business in two business segments: mechanical and electrical. Nature and Economics of Our Business In our mechanical business segment, customers hire us to ensure HVAC systems deliver specified or generally expected heating, cooling, conditioning and circulation of air in a facility. This entails installing core system equipment such as packaged heating and air conditioning units, or in the case of larger facilities, separate core components such as chillers, boilers, air handlers, and cooling towers. We also typically install connecting and distribution elements such as piping and ducting. In our electrical business segment, our principal business activity is electrical construction and engineering in the commercial and industrial field. We also perform electrical logistics services and electrical service work. In both our mechanical and electrical business segments, our responsibilities usually require conforming the systems to pre-established engineering drawings and equipment and performance specifications, which we frequently participate in establishing. Our project management responsibilities include staging equipment and materials to project sites, deploying labor to perform the work, and coordinating with other service providers on the project, including any subcontractors we might use to deliver our portion of the work. Approximately 91.0 of our revenue is earned on a project basis for installation services in newly constructed facilities or for replacement of systems in existing facilities. When competing for project business, we usually estimate the costs we will incur on a project, and then propose a bid to the customer that includes a contract price and other performance and payment terms. Our bid price and terms are intended to cover our estimated costs on the project and provide a profit margin to us commensurate with the value of the installed system to the customer, the risk that project costs or duration will vary from estimate, the schedule on which we will be paid, the opportunities for other work that we might forego by committing capacity to this project, and other costs that we incur to support our operations but which are not specific to the project. Typically, customers will seek pricing from competitors for a given project. While the criteria on which customers select a provider vary widely and include factors such as quality, technical expertise, on-time performance, post-project support and service, and company history and financial strength, we believe that price for value is the most influential factor for most customers in choosing a mechanical or electrical installation and service provider. After a customer accepts our bid, we generally enter into a contract with the customer that specifies what we will deliver on the project, what our related responsibilities are and how much and when we will be paid. Our overall 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 price for the project is typically set at a fixed amount in the contract, although changes in project specifications or work conditions that result in unexpected additional work are usually subject to additional payment from the customer via what are commonly known as change orders. Project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project. Project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work. Amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage. Labor, materials and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service. Accordingly, labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance. Given the fixed price nature of much of our project work, if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders, we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work. We also perform some project work on a cost-plus or a time and materials basis, under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed-upon profit margin, and such projects are sometimes subject to a guaranteed maximum cost. These margins are frequently less than fixed-price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost-plus or time and materials work. As of September 30, 2024, we had 8,811 projects in process. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately 1.7 million. Our projects generally require working capital funding of equipment and labor costs. Customer payments on periodic billings generally do not recover these costs until late in the job. Our average project duration, together with typical retention terms as discussed above, generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year. We have what we consider to be a well-diversified distribution of revenue across end-use sectors that we believe reduces our exposure to negative developments in any given sector. Because of the integral nature of our services to most buildings, we have the legal right in almost all cases to attach liens to buildings or related funding sources when we have not been fully paid for installing systems, except with respect to some government buildings. The service work that we do, which is discussed further below, usually does not give rise to lien rights. We also perform larger projects. Taken together, projects with contract prices of 2 million or more totaled 13.16 billion of aggregate contract value as of September 30, 2024, or approximately 89 of a total contract value for all projects in progress, totaling 14.72 billion. Generally, projects closer in size to 2 million will be completed in one year or less. It is unusual for us to work on a project that exceeds two years in length. A stratification of projects in progress as of September 30, 2024, by contract price, is as follows: Aggregate Contract No. of Price Value Contract Price of Project Projects (millions) Under 2 million 7,764 1,565.9 2 million - 10 million 715 3,312.5 10 million - 20 million 150 2,113.2 20 million - 40 million 118 3,362.2 Greater than 40 million 64 4,368.6 Total 8,811 14,722.4 In addition to project work, approximately 9.0 of our revenue represents maintenance and repair service on already installed HVAC, electrical, and controls systems. This kind of work usually takes from a few hours to a few days to perform. Prices to the customer are based on the equipment and materials used in the service as well as technician labor time. We usually bill the customer for service work when it is complete, typically with payment terms of up to thirty days. We also provide maintenance and repair service under ongoing contracts. Under these contracts, we are paid regular monthly or quarterly amounts and provide specified service based on customer requirements. These agreements typically are for one or more years and frequently contain thirty- to sixty-day cancellation notice periods. A relatively small portion of our revenue comes from national and regional account customers. These customers typically have multiple sites and contract with us to perform maintenance and repair service. These contracts may also provide for us to perform new or replacement systems installation. We operate a national call center to dispatch

 technicians to sites requiring service. We perform the majority of this work with our own employees, with the balance being subcontracted to third parties that meet our performance qualifications. Profile and Management of Our Operations We manage our 47 operating units based on a variety of factors. Financial measures we emphasize include profitability and use of capital as indicated by cash flow and by other measures of working capital principally involving project cost, billings and receivables. We also monitor selling, general, administrative and indirect project support expense, backlog, workforce size and mix, growth in revenue and profits, variation of actual project cost from original estimate, and overall financial performance in comparison to budget and updated forecasts. Operational factors we emphasize include project selection, estimating, pricing, safety, management and execution practices, labor utilization, training, and the make-up of both existing backlog as well as new business being pursued, in terms of project size, technical application, facility type, end-use customers and industries and location of the work. Most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis. Attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business, particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation, the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants, such as architects and consulting engineers, and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets. Accordingly, we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality, stability, and contingency planning, including related considerations of compensation and non-competition protection where applicable. Economic and Industry Factors As a mechanical and electrical services provider, we operate in the broader nonresidential construction services industry and are affected by trends in this sector. While we do not have operations in all major cities of the United States, we believe our national presence is sufficiently large that we experience trends in demand for and pricing of our services that are consistent with trends in the national nonresidential construction sector. As a result, we monitor the views of major construction sector forecasters along with macroeconomic factors they believe drive the sector, including trends in gross domestic product, interest rates, business investment, employment, demographics and the fiscal condition of federal, state and local governments. Spending decisions for building construction, renovation and system replacement are generally made on a project basis, usually with some degree of discretion as to when and if projects proceed. With larger amounts of capital, time, and discretion involved, spending decisions are affected to a significant degree by uncertainty, particularly concerns about economic and financial conditions and trends. We have experienced periods of time when economic weakness caused a significant slowdown in decisions to proceed with installation and replacement project work. Operating Environment and Management Emphasis In 2020, the advent of a global pandemic led to some delays in service and construction, including delayed project starts and air pockets or pauses during 2020 and 2021. We experienced increasing demand in 2022 and 2023, and we expect that the demand environment, especially for manufacturing and technology customers, will remain at high levels for the rest of 2024 and leading into 2025. While the impacts from the supply chain shortages have improved, we continue to experience increased labor costs and delays in delivery of certain materials and equipment. We expect that constraints and delays in our supply chain will continue to abate in the near term; however, we anticipate that pressure on cost and availability, especially for skilled labor, will continue for the rest of 2024 and leading into 2025. We have a credit facility in place with terms we believe are favorable that does not expire until July 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had 770.0 million of credit available to borrow under our credit facility. We have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs, and we believe our relationships with the surety markets are strong and benefit from our operating history and financial position. We have generated positive free cash flow in each of the last twenty-five calendar years and will continue our emphasis in this area. We believe that the relative size and strength of our Balance Sheet and surety relationships, as compared to most companies in our industry, represent competitive advantages for us.

 As discussed at greater length in Results of Operations below, we expect price competition to continue as local and regional industry participants compete for customers. We will continue to invest in our service business, to pursue the more active sectors in our markets, and to emphasize our regional and national account business. Cyclicality and Seasonality The construction industry is subject to business cycle fluctuation. As a result, our volume of business, particularly in new construction projects and renovation, may be adversely affected by declines in new installation and replacement projects in various geographic regions of the United States during periods of economic weakness. The mechanical and electrical contracting industries are also subject to seasonal variations. The demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months (the first quarter of the year) due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months. Demand for our services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally will be lower in the first calendar quarter. Critical Accounting Estimates Management believes that there have been no significant changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to the items that we disclosed as our "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. A summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates.

In the first quarter of 2024, we split one of our operating locations into two separate operating locations. Additionally, we completed the acquisitions of Summit Industrial Construction, LLC Summit and J S Mechanical Contractors, Inc. J S ), which both report as separate operating locations. We had 47 operating locations as of September 30, 2024. Acquisitions are included in our results of operations from the respective acquisition date. The same-store comparison from 2024 to 2023, as described below, excludes Summit, which was acquired on February 1, 2024, J S, which was acquired on February 1, 2024, DECCO, Inc. DECCO ), which was acquired on October 2, 2023, and one month of results for Eldeco, Inc Eldeco ), which was acquired on February 1, 2023. An operating location is included in the same-store comparison on the first day it has comparable prior year operating data, except for immaterial acquisitions that are often absorbed and integrated with existing operations. Revenue Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 434.2 million, or 31.5 , to 1.81 billion compared to the same period in 2023. The increase included a 17.5 increase in revenue related to same-store activity and a 14.0 increase related to the Summit, J S, and DECCO acquisitions. The same-store revenue growth was largely driven by strong market conditions, including the increase in our backlog. The increase in demand has been strong in the technology sector, particularly for data centers and chip plants. The following table presents our operating segment revenue (in thousands, except percentages):

 J S, and DECCO, and 213.7 million was attributable to same-store activity. The same-store revenue increase primarily resulted from an increase in activity in the technology sector at one of our Virginia operations 38.6 million), one of our Texas operations 37.5 million) and at our North Carolina operation 25.6 million) and in the healthcare and manufacturing sectors at our Mississippi operation 31.8 million). The same-store revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease in activity in the manufacturing sector at one of our Indiana operations 23.1 million). Revenue for our electrical segment increased 26.9 million, or 7.8 , to 373.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in activity in the technology sector at our Texas electrical operation 23.6 million). Revenue for the first nine months of 2024 increased 1.31 billion, or 34.0 , to 5.16 billion compared to the same period in 2023. The increase included a 23.1 increase in revenue related to same-store activity and a 10.9 increase related to the Summit, J S, DECCO, and Eldeco acquisitions. The same-store revenue growth was largely driven by strong market conditions, including the increase in our backlog. The increase in demand has been strong in the technology and manufacturing sectors, particularly for data centers, chip plants, food and pharmaceuticals.

 Revenue for our mechanical segment increased 1.15 billion, or 39.3 , to 4.08 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Of this increase, 412.2 million resulted from the acquisitions of Summit, J S, and DECCO, and 737.3 million was attributable to same-store activity. The same-store increase primarily resulted from an increase in activity in the technology sector at two of our Texas operations 244.6 million), at our North Carolina operation 109.5 million) and at one of our Virginia operations 93.0 million). Revenue for our electrical segment increased 161.0 million, or 17.4 , to 1.08 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase primarily resulted from higher activity in the technology sector at our Texas electrical operation 99.9 million). Backlog reflects revenue still to be recognized under contracted or committed installation and replacement project work. Project work generally lasts less than one year. Service agreement revenue, service work and short duration projects, which are generally billed as performed, do not flow through backlog. Accordingly, backlog represents only a portion of our revenue for any given future period, and it represents revenue that is likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months. As a result, we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term, and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters. The following table presents our operating segment backlog (in thousands, except percentages): 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Backlog: Mechanical Segment 4,441,923 78.2 4,027,927 78.1 3,117,994 72.7 Electrical Segment 1,238,858 21.8 1,129,449 21.9 1,169,592 27.3 Total 5,680,781 100.0 5,157,376 100.0 4,287,586 100.0 Backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 5.68 billion, a 1.6 decrease from June 30, 2024 backlog of 5.77 billion, and a 32.5 increase from September 30, 2023 backlog of 4.29 billion. The sequential backlog decrease was primarily a result of the completion of project work at two of our Texas operations 78.8 million), one of our Virginia operations 56.5 million) and our Indiana electrical operation 32.7 million). The sequential backlog decrease

 was partially offset by increased project bookings at another one of our Texas operations 90.7 million). The year-over-year backlog increase included the acquisitions of Summit 324.6 million), J S 136.1 million) and DECCO 49.4 million) as well as a same-store increase of 883.1 million, or 20.6 . Same-store year-over-year backlog growth was primarily attributable to increased project bookings at our Texas electrical operation 268.4 million), one of our Virginia operations 146.2 million), our Mississippi operation 109.2 million), our North Carolina operations 106.8 million) and another one of our Texas operations 104.3 million). Gross Profit Gross profit increased 104.2 million, or 37.6 , to 381.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase included a 24.7 million, or 8.9 , increase related to the Summit, J S, and DECCO acquisitions, as well as a 28.7 increase in same-store activity. The same-store increase in gross profit was driven by both higher revenues in the current year as well as improved execution in our operations, including improvements in project execution at two of our Texas operations 31.3 million) and our Texas electrical operation 26.1 million). Additionally, we had increased volumes at one of our Virginia operations 7.9 million). As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the third quarter increased from 20.1 in 2023 to 21.1 in 2024, primarily due to the factors discussed above and improvements in our electrical segment gross profit margin. Gross profit increased 331.8 million, or 46.7 , to 1.04 billion for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase included a 6.0 increase related to the Summit, J S, DECCO, and Eldeco acquisitions, as well as a 40.7 increase in same-store activity. The same-store increase in gross profit was primarily driven by both higher revenues in the current year as well as improved execution in our operations, including improvements in project execution at our Texas electrical operation 74.4 million) and another one of our Texas operations 47.5 million). Additionally, we had increased volumes at one of our Texas operations 31.5 million), our North Carolina operations 27.5 million) and one of our Virginia operations 22.7 million). These increases were partially offset by a benefit in the first quarter of 2023 of 6.6 million in gross profit related to positive developments on legal matters. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the nine-month period increased from 18.5 in 2023 to 20.2 in 2024, primarily due to the factors discussed above and improvements in our electrical segment gross profit margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG A SG A increased 37.2 million, or 26.1 , to 180.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023. On a same-store basis, excluding amortization expense, SG A increased 26.5 million, or 19.9 . The same-store increase is primarily due to higher same-store revenue and increased compensation costs 19.0 million), largely attributable to increased headcount. Amortization expense increased 4.8 million during the period, primarily as a result of the Summit, J S, and DECCO acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, SG A for the third quarter decreased from 10.4 in 2023 to 9.9 in 2024 due to leverage resulting from the increase in revenue. SG A increased 108.0 million, or 26.1 , to 522.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 2023. On a same-store basis, excluding amortization expense, SG A increased 77.2 million, or 20.0 . The same-store increase is primarily due to higher same-store revenue and increased compensation costs 57.7 million), largely attributable to increased headcount and increased cost of labor. Amortization expense increased 12.8 million during the period, primarily as a result of the Summit, J S and DECCO acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, SG A for the nine-month period decreased from 10.8 in 2023 to 10.1 in 2024 due to leverage resulting from the increase in revenue. We have included same-store SG A, excluding amortization, because we believe it is an effective measure of comparative results of operations. However, same-store SG A, excluding amortization, is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results and, accordingly, should not be considered an alternative to SG A as shown in our consolidated statements of operations.

 Interest Income Interest income increased 2.9 million to 3.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income increased 4.3 million to 6.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in interest income for the third quarter of 2024 and first nine months of 2024 is due to an increase in our average cash balance and higher interest rates compared to the prior year. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 0.2 million, or 8.3 , to 1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense decreased 4.8 million, or 48.7 , to 5.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 and first nine months of 2024 is due to a decrease in our average outstanding debt balance compared to the prior year. Changes in the Fair Value of Contingent Earn-out Obligations The contingent earn-out obligations are measured at fair value each reporting period, and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings. Expense from changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations for the third quarter of 2024 increased 8.5 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in earn-out expense was primarily driven by higher actual and projected earnings at Summit. Expense from changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations for the first nine months of 2024 increased 30.2 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in earn-out expense was primarily driven by higher actual and projected earnings at Summit and J S. Expense or income from changes in earn-out valuations may be more volatile in future periods due to large earn-out agreements for acquisitions that closed in 2024. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 104.0 million with an effective tax rate of 21.6 as compared to a provision for income taxes of 44.6 million with an effective tax rate of 16.1 for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for 2024 is slightly higher than the 21 federal statutory rate primarily due to net state income taxes (3.6 and net nondeductible expenses (0.6 ), partially offset by the credit for increasing research activities (the R D tax credit (3.6 ). The effective tax rate for 2023 was lower than the 21 federal statutory rate primarily due to the R D tax credit (5.6 and an increase in the R D tax credit for the 2022 tax year (3.9 ). These R D tax credit benefits were partially offset by net state income taxes (3.7 and net nondeductible expenses (1.4 ). As a result of conforming amendments made to the R D tax credit in connection with the deferral of tax deductions for research and experimental R E expenditures pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017), our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from a 3.7 million increase in the R D tax credit. Outlook We experienced strong ongoing demand in the first nine months of 2024, although we continue to experience increased labor costs and impacts from supply chain shortages, including delays in delivery of certain materials and equipment. We are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing, and we are ordering materials on an earlier timeline and seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risks and to mitigate the effects of these challenges. We have been generally successful in maintaining productivity and in procuring needed materials despite ongoing challenges. We have a good pipeline of opportunities and potential backlog. Considering our substantial advance bookings, we currently anticipate solid earnings for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025. Although we are preparing for a wide range of challenges and economic circumstances, including a potential recession, we currently expect that supportive conditions for our industry, especially for our manufacturing and technology customers, are likely to continue for the rest of 2024 and leading into 2025.

The substantial majority of the capital used in our business is working capital that funds our costs of labor and installed equipment deployed in project work until our customer pays us. Customary terms in our industry allow customers to withhold a small portion of the contract price until after we have completed the work, typically for six months. Amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage. Our average project duration, together with typical retention terms, generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but can also be influenced by working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. In particular, working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs, primarily associated with labor, equipment and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the receivables resulting from the work performed are billed and collected. Working capital needs are generally higher during the late winter and spring months as we prepare and plan for the increased project demand when favorable weather conditions exist in the summer and fall months. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the late summer and fall months as project completion is underway. These seasonal trends are sometimes offset by changes in the timing of major projects, which can be impacted by the weather, project delays or accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending. Cash provided by operating activities was 638.6 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 466.6 million during the same period in 2023. The 172.0 million increase in cash provided was primarily driven by higher earnings before non-cash expenses such as amortization of intangible assets, a 138.4 million benefit from increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities driven by the size and timing of payments and a 113.3 million benefit from changes in accounts receivables, net. This increase was partially offset by a 136.7 million change in billings in excess of costs and deferred revenue due to more advanced payments received in the prior year. We have received large advanced payments in the current and prior years that will reverse when project costs are incurred, except to the extent that additional advanced payments are received. Cash Used in Investing Activities During the first nine months of 2024, cash used in investing activities was 304.0 million compared to 119.1 million during the same period in 2023. The 184.9 million increase in cash used primarily related to an increase in cash paid (net of cash acquired) for acquisitions in the current year compared to the same period in 2023. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was 124.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 267.0 million during the same period in 2023. The 142.9 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to higher net repayments of debt in the prior year as operating cash flows were used to pay down outstanding debt partially offset by increased share repurchases of 33.5 million in the current year.

Table of Contents 
 Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less customary capital expenditures, plus the proceeds from asset sales. We believe free cash flow, by encompassing both profit margins and the use of working capital over our approximately one year working capital cycle, is an effective measure of operating effectiveness and efficiency. We have included free cash flow information here for this reason, and because we are often asked about it by third parties evaluating us. However, free cash flow is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results, and accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income, net income, or amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles. Free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies. Share Repurchase Program On March 29, 2007, our Board of Directors (the Board approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 1.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. Subsequently, the Board has from time to time increased the number of shares that may be acquired under the program and approved extensions of the program. On August 7, 2024, the Board approved an extension to the program by increasing the shares authorized for repurchase by 0.4 million shares. Since the inception of the repurchase program, the Board has approved 11.4 million shares to be repurchased. As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 10.4 million shares at an average price of 29.99 per share under the repurchase program. The share repurchases will be made from time to time at our discretion in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The Board may modify, suspend, extend or terminate the program at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.1 million shares for approximately 42.3 million at an average price of 310.02 per share. Debt Revolving Credit Facility We have an 850.0 million senior credit facility (the Facility provided by a syndicate of banks, which is composed of a revolving credit line guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The Facility also provides for an accordion or increase option not to exceed the greater of (a) 250 million and (b) 1.0x Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), as well as a sublimit of up to 175.0 million issuable in the form of letters of credit. The Facility expires in July 2027 and is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our personal property except for assets related to projects subject to surety bonds and the equity of, and assets held by, certain unrestricted subsidiaries and our wholly owned captive insurance company, and a second lien on our assets related to projects subject to surety bonds. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility, 80.0 million in letters of credit outstanding and 770.0 million of credit available. There are two interest rate options for borrowings under the Facility, the Base Rate Loan (as defined in the Facility) option and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR Loan option. These rates are floating rates determined by the broad financial markets, meaning they can and do move up and down from time to time. Additional margins are then added to these two rates. Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. We have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts. Our lenders issue such letters of credit through the Facility. A letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the lenders for amounts they fund to honor the letter of credit holder s claim. Absent a claim, there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit. However, because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders, letters of credit are treated as a use of Facility capacity. The letter of credit fees range from 1.00 to 2.00 per annum, based on the Net Leverage Ratio. 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 80.0 million in letter of credit commitments, of which 55.0 million will expire in 2024, 24.8 million will expire in 2025 and 0.2 million will expire in 2026. The substantial majority of these letters of credit are posted with insurers who disburse funds on our behalf in connection with our workers compensation, auto liability and general liability insurance program. These letters of credit provide additional security to the insurers that sufficient financial resources will be available to fund claims on our behalf, many of which develop over long periods of time, should we ever encounter financial duress. Posting of letters of credit for this purpose is a common practice for entities that manage their self-insurance programs through third-party insurers as we do. While some of these letter of credit commitments expire in the next twelve months, we expect nearly all of them, particularly those supporting our insurance programs, will be renewed annually. Commitment fees are payable on the portion of the revolving loan capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time. These fees range from 0.15 to 0.25 per annum, based on the Net Leverage Ratio. The Facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply. Covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarter end. We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. Notes to Former Owners As part of the consideration used to acquire eight companies, we have outstanding notes to the former owners. Together, these notes had an outstanding balance of 67.6 million as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, future principal payments of notes to former owners by maturity year are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Balance at Range of Stated September 30, 2024 Interest Rates 2025 5,968 2.3 - 2.5 2026 30,625 2.5 - 5.5 2027 26,000 5.5 2028 5,000 5.5 Total 67,593 Outlook We have generated positive net free cash flow for the last twenty-five calendar years, much of which occurred during challenging economic and industry conditions. We also continue to have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and we maintain what we feel are reasonable cash balances. We believe these factors will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. Other Commitments Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. If we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur. Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and can decline to issue bonds at any time. Historically, approximately 10 to 20 of our business has required bonds. While we currently have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs, future market conditions or changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work. If that were to occur, our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds, posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash, and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties. We would likely also encounter concerns from customers, suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness. While we believe our general operating and financial characteristics would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 interruption in the availability of bonding capacity, such an interruption would likely cause our revenue and profits to decline in the near term. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates, as discussed below. We are actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques. We are not exposed to any other significant financial market risks, including commodity price risk, or foreign currency exchange risk from the use of derivative financial instruments. At times, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. We have exposure to changes in interest rates under our revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our debt with fixed interest rates consists of notes to former owners of acquired companies and acquired notes payable. We measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. We did not recognize any impairments in the current year on those assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The valuation of the Company s contingent earn-out payments is determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreements e.g. , minimum and maximum payment, length of earn-out periods, manner of calculating any amounts due, etc.) and utilizes assumptions with regard to future cash flows, probabilities of achieving such future cash flows and a discount rate. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our executive management is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are subject to certain legal and regulatory claims, including lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims. We have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain litigation in our consolidated financial statements. While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, in management s opinion and based on reports of counsel, any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition, after giving effect to provisions already recorded. In the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a pre-tax gain of 6.8 million from legal developments and settlements that primarily relate to disputes with customers regarding the outcome of completed projects as well as an obligation to perform subcontract work under two executed letters of intent for subsequent projects that we believed were not enforceable. The pre-tax gain of 6.8 million was recorded as an increase in gross profit of 6.6 million, a reduction in SG A of 0.7 million, an increase in interest income of 1.3 million and an increase in the change in fair value of contingent earn-out obligations expense of 1.8 million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded an accrual for unresolved matters, which is not material to our financial statements, based on our analysis of likely outcomes related to the respective matters; however, it is possible that the ultimate outcome and associated costs will deviate from our estimates and that, in the event of an unexpectedly adverse outcome, we may experience additional costs and expenses in future periods. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On March 29, 2007, our Board of Directors (the Board approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 1.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. Subsequently, the Board has from time to time increased the number of shares that may be acquired under the program and approved extensions of the program. On August 7, 2024, the Board approved an extension to the program by increasing the shares authorized for repurchase by 0.4 million shares. Since the inception of the repurchase program, the Board has approved 11.4 million shares to be repurchased. As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 10.4 million shares at an average price of 29.99 per share under the repurchase program. The share repurchases will be made from time to time at our discretion in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The Board may modify, suspend, extend or terminate the program at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.1 million shares for approximately 42.3 million at an average price of 310.02 per share.

Under our stock incentive plans, employees may elect to have us withhold common shares to satisfy statutory federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising on the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of options. When we withhold these shares, we are required to remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the market price of the shares withheld, which could be deemed a purchase of the common shares by us on the date of withholding. ITEM 5. Other Information Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Officers During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no directors or officers of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as defined in Item 408(a) and (c) of Regulation S-K.
