 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For additional risk factors, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 10-K ). These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. The following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the 2023 10-K. The information herein relates to Qurate Retail, Inc. and its controlled subsidiaries (collectively Qurate Retail, the Company, Consolidated Qurate Retail, us, we or our unless the context otherwise requires). Overview We own controlling interests in video and online commerce companies. Our largest businesses and reportable segments are our operating segment comprised of QVC U.S. and HSN, Inc. QxH and QVC International. QVC markets and sells a wide variety of consumer products in the United States U.S. and several foreign countries via highly engaging video-rich, interactive shopping experiences, primarily by means of its televised shopping programs and the Internet through its domestic and international websites and mobile applications. Cornerstone Brands, Inc. CBI ), consists of a portfolio of aspirational home and apparel brands, and is a reportable segment . Our Corporate and other category includes corporate activity along with various cost method investments. Prior to the divesture of Zulily, LLC Zulily described below, Zulily s results were reported in Corporate and other. Zulily was a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail until its divestiture on May 24, 2023. Qurate Retail recognized a loss on the divestiture of 64 million in the second quarter of 2023. Zulily is included in Corporate and other through May 23, 2023 and is not presented as a discontinued operation as the disposition did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on Qurate Retail s operations and financial results. Included in revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations is 301 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to Zulily. Included in net earnings (loss) in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations are losses of 44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to Zulily. Strategies On June 27, 2022, Qurate Retail announced a five-point turnaround plan designed to stabilize and differentiate its core QVC U.S. and HSN brands and expand the Company's leadership in video streaming commerce Project Athens ). Project Athens main initiatives include: (i) improve customer experience and grow relationships; (ii) rigorously execute core processes; (iii) lower cost to serve; (iv) optimize the brand portfolio; and (v) build new high growth businesses. Improve customer experience and grow relationships. Qurate Retail is focused on rebuilding stronger connections with our customers. In order to improve customer experience and grow relationships, Qurate Retail is working to optimize programming using advanced analytics to align product offerings, promotions and airtime with customer preferences. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure which will endeavor to improve the customer's order to delivery experience by reducing shipping time and improving shipment tracking visibility. We will continue to focus on customer loyalty through providing customers with a more personalized shopping experience. Rigorously execute core processes. Qurate Retail is enhancing its core processes to deliver the human story telling experience behind a product while also sharing a clear and compelling value proposition. In order to rigorously execute core processes, Qurate Retail will optimize pricing and assortment by investing in enhanced information technology IT systems that support real-time pricing and promotion adjustments at an item level. We are focused on growing our private label brands in an effort to drive revenue and margin at a productive scale.

 Lower cost to serve. Qurate Retail is right sizing its cost base to improve profitability and cash generation. In order to lower cost to serve, Qurate Retail has enhanced review of spending to identify cost savings opportunities and opportunities to create new operational efficiencies, through end-to-end product and process reviews, and leveraging technology and process automation. Additionally, we have improved product margin through lower fulfillment costs, freight optimization and higher productivity. Optimize the brand portfolio. Qurate Retail divested Zulily in the second quarter of 2023, consistent with its goal of optimizing the brand portfolio. Qurate Retail is exploring untapped opportunities to maximize brand value. Build new high growth business. Finally, Qurate Retail is focused on expanding in the video streaming shopping market. In order to build new high growth businesses, Qurate Retail is working to expand streaming viewership by improving the current streaming experience with enhanced video and navigation and seamless transactions. Additionally, we are shaping the future streaming experience with exclusive content, program and deal concepts. We are also building a next generation shopping app featuring vendors with self-made content. During 2022, QVC commenced the first phase of Project Athens, including actions to reduce inventory and a planned workforce reduction that was completed in February 2023. QVC recorded restructuring charges of 13 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. These initiatives are consistent with QVC s strategy to operate more efficiently as it implements its turnaround plan. During the second quarter of 2024, QVC entered into an agreement and announced a plan to shift its global operating model for IT services to a managed services model. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QVC recorded restructuring charges of 18 million in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Trends QVC s future net revenue will depend on its ability to grow through digital platforms, retain and grow revenue from existing customers, and attract new customers. QVC's future net revenue may also be affected by (i) the willingness of cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators to continue carrying QVC's programming service; (ii) QVC's ability to maintain favorable channel positioning, which may become more difficult due to governmental action or from distributors converting analog customers to digital; (iii) changes in television viewing habits because of video-on-demand technologies and Internet video services; (iv) QVC's ability to source new and compelling products; and (v) general economic conditions. The current economic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate, has impacted and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and services since a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls, to varying degrees, during times of economic instability and inflationary pressures. Global financial markets may experience disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including Japan and Europe, continue to be uncertain or deteriorate, our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their discretionary spending. Any further suspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments decline. Such weak economic conditions may also inhibit our expansion into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. The Company has continued to see inflationary pressures during the period including higher wages and merchandise costs consistent with inflation experienced by the global economy. If these pressures persist, inflated costs may result in certain increased costs outpacing our pricing power in the near term. Due to a goodwill impairment related to the QxH reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2023, the fair value of goodwill does not significantly exceed its carrying value. The Company will continue to monitor QVC s current business

 performance versus the current and updated long-term forecasts, among other relevant considerations, to determine if the carrying value of its assets (including Goodwill) is appropriate. Future outlook declines in revenue, cash flows, or other factors could result in a sustained decrease in fair value that may result in a determination that carrying value adjustments are required, which could be material. Fire at Rocky Mount Fulfillment Center On December 18, 2021, QVC experienced a fire at its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in North Carolina. Rocky Mount was QVC s second-largest fulfillment center, processing approximately 25 to 30 of volume for QVC U.S., and also served as QVC U.S. s primary returns center for hard goods. The building was significantly damaged as a result of the fire and related smoke and did not reopen. QVC took steps to mitigate disruption to operations including diverting inbound orders, leveraging its existing fulfillment centers and supplementing these facilities with short-term leased space as needed. QVC sold the property in February 2023 and received cash proceeds of 2 million and 19 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively and recognized gains on the sale of 2 million and 17 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. QVC assessed its network footprint and is making investments to expand capacity and increase throughput as a result of the loss of the Rocky Mount fulfillment center. Based on the provisions of QVC s insurance policies certain fire related costs were recoverable. In June 2023, QVC agreed to a final insurance settlement with its insurance company and received all remaining proceeds related to the Rocky Mount claim. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC received 280 million of insurance proceeds, of which 210 million represented recoveries for business interruption losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC recorded 5 million and 32 million of fire related costs, respectively, and recognized net losses of 5 million and net gains of 208 million, respectively, representing proceeds received in excess of recoverable losses, in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Sale-leaseback Transactions In November 2022, QVC International entered into agreements to sell two properties located in Germany and the United Kingdom U.K. to an independent third party. Under the terms of the agreements, QVC received net cash proceeds of 102 million related to its German facility and 80 million related to its U.K. facility when the sale closed in January 2023. Concurrent with the sale, QVC entered into agreements to lease each of the properties back from the purchaser over an initial term of 20 years with the option to extend the terms of the property leases for up to four consecutive terms of five years. QVC recognized a 69 million and 44 million gain related to the successful sale-leaseback of the German and U.K. properties, respectively, during the first quarter of 2023 calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the properties. The Company accounted for the leases as operating leases and recorded a 42 million and 32 million right-of-use asset and operating lease liability for the German and U.K. properties, respectively. In December 2023, QVC entered into an agreement to sell an owned and operated property in Germany to an independent third party. This property was owned and considered held for sale as of December 31, 2023, and is included in other assets, at cost, net of accumulated amortization in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Under the terms of the agreement, QVC received net cash proceeds of 6 million related to its German facility when the sale closed in February 2024. QVC recognized a 1 million gain related to the sale during the first quarter of 2024, calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the property. Concurrent with the sale, QVC entered into an agreement to lease a portion of the property back over two years and recorded an operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability of 1 million.

 Results of Operations Consolidated General. We provide in the tables below information regarding our consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense, as well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our principal reporting segments. The "Corporate and other" category consists of those assets or businesses which we do not disclose separately. For a more detailed discussion and analysis of the financial results of the principal reporting segments, see "Results of Operations Businesses" below. Operating Results

Consolidated Qurate Retail revenue decreased 5.4 or 135 million and 8.7 or 679 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Revenue declined in all segments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in Corporate and other revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the divestiture of Zulily in the prior year. See "Results of Operations Businesses" below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of QVC and CBI. Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation includes compensation primarily related to options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees. We recorded 3 million and 10 million of stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 22 million and 40 million of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily due to decreases at QxH and at the corporate level. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Qurate Retail equity awards was approximately 21 million. Such amount will be recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years. Operating income. Our consolidated operating income increased 1 million and decreased 231 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income increased 16 million at QxH, partially offset by

 decreases of 6 million at QVC International and 6 million at CBI, and an increase in losses of 3 million at the Corporate and other segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income declined 161 million at QxH, 113 million at QVC International and 11 million at CBI. See "Results of Operations Businesses" below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of QVC and CBI. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in operating losses at the Corporate and other segment of 54 million, primarily related to the divestiture of Zulily in the prior year. Adjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale-leaseback transactions. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings (loss), cash flows provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:

The decrease in Adjusted OIBDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in Adjusted OIBDA at QxH of 19 million, at QVC International of 7 million, and at CBI of 5 million, and an increase in Adjusted OIBDA losses at Corporate and other of 4 million, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in Adjusted OIBDA at QxH of 36 million, and a decrease in Adjusted OIBDA losses at Corporate and other of 34 million, partially offset by decreases in Adjusted OIBDA at QVC International of 4 million and at CBI of 9 million, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted OIBDA losses in the Corporate and other segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the divestiture of Zulily in the prior year.

Interest expense decreased 2 million and increased 17 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the repayment of QVC s 4.85 Senior Secured Notes due 2024 during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by higher interest on QVC s Senior Secured Credit Facility due to a higher outstanding balance compared to the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was due to the reversal of interest expense related to the settlement of state income tax reserves at QVC during the prior year. Interest and dividend income. Interest and dividend income remained flat and increased 2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a greater amount of cash held in interest bearing accounts. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 amounts in millions Equity securities (17) (2) (19) (19) Exchangeable senior debentures (19) (24) (34) (37) Other financial instruments 12 (4) (36) (14) (53) (60) The changes in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net are due to market activity in the applicable period related to the financial instruments that are marked to market on a periodic basis. The increase in realized and unrealized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was primarily driven by increased losses on equity securities and no gains on other financial instruments in the current year, partially offset by a decrease in losses on the exchangeable senior debentures driven by decreases in stock prices of the securities underlying the debentures compared to the prior year. The decrease in realized and unrealized losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was primarily driven by no losses on other financial instruments in the current year, and a decrease in losses on the exchangeable senior debentures driven by decreases in stock prices of the securities underlying the debentures compared to the prior year. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also impacted by a gain of 35 million due to the extinguishment of the Company s 1.75 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046. Loss on disposition of Zulily, net. The Company recorded a net loss of 64 million associated with the disposition of Zulily during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (see note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements).

 Other, net. Other, net loss increased 14 million and 30 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increased loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by tax sharing expense in the prior year and no tax sharing expense in the current year. The increased losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily the result of a loss on the early extinguishment of debt compared to a gain in the prior year, tax sharing expense compared to a benefit in the prior year, and increased foreign exchange losses. Income taxes. Earnings (loss) before income taxes, income tax (expense) benefit, and the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 amounts in millions Earnings (loss) before income taxes 33 78 283 Income tax (expense) benefit (15) (21) (53) (119) Effective tax rate 64 68 42 The Company had zero earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, but income tax expense of 15 million primarily related to foreign income tax expense and non-deductible interest expense related to the 8.0 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Preferred Stock ). Income tax expense was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to foreign income tax expense and non-deductible interest expense related to the Preferred Stock . Income tax expense was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to foreign income tax expense and non-deductible interest expense related to the Preferred Stock. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also impacted by non-deductible stock compensation, and was partially offset by a tax benefit from a change in the Company s effective state tax rate used to measure deferred taxes. Net earnings. We had net losses of 15 million and net earnings of 12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net earnings of 25 million and 164 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in net earnings (loss) was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses. Material Changes in Financial Condition As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, securities of other government agencies, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments. The following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, equity issuances, dividend and interest receipts, proceeds from asset sales, debt (including availability under QVC s bank credit facilities (the Credit Facility ), as discussed in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), and cash generated by the operating activities of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Cash generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries is only a source of liquidity to the extent such cash exceeds the working capital needs of the subsidiaries and is not otherwise restricted. For example, under QVC s bond indentures, it is able to pay dividends or make other restricted payments if it is not in default on its senior secured notes and its consolidated leverage ratio is no greater than 3.5 to 1.0. In addition, under the Credit Facility QVC is able to pay dividends or make other restricted payments if it is not in default on the Credit Facility and the consolidated leverage ratio of QVC, QVC Global Corporate Holdings, LLC and CBI is no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. Further, under QVC s bond indentures and the Credit Facility, unlimited dividends are permitted to service the debt of parent entities of QVC so long as there is no default (i.e., no leverage test is needed). As of September 30, 2024, QVC s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5 to 1.0 and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes. Although QVC will not be able to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes leverage basket, QVC will continue to be permitted to make unlimited dividends to parent entities of QVC to service the principal and interest when due in respect of indebtedness of such parent entities (so long as there

 is no default under the indentures governing QVC s senior secured notes) and permitted to make certain restricted payments to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, Qurate Retail's liquidity position included the following:

Borrowing capacity amount in millions Credit Facility 1,753 To the extent that the Company recognizes any taxable gains from the sale of assets we may incur tax expense and be required to make tax payments, thereby reducing any cash proceeds. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 165 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash held in foreign subsidiaries that is available for domestic purposes with no significant tax consequences upon repatriation to the U.S. QVC accrues foreign taxes on the unremitted earnings of its international subsidiaries. Approximately 58 of QVC s foreign cash balance was that of QVC-Japan (as defined below). QVC owns 60 of QVC-Japan and shares all profits and losses with the 40 minority interest holder, Mitsui Co., LTD Mitsui ). Additionally, we believe our businesses will generate positive cash flow from operations during 2024. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 amounts in millions Cash Flow Information Net cash provided (used) by operating activities 313 602 Net cash provided (used) by investing activities (149) 18 Net cash provided (used) by financing activities (412) (776) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Qurate Retail's primary uses of cash were net debt repayments of 354 million, capital expenditures of 137 million, dividends paid to noncontrolling interest of 51 million, and expenditures for television distribution rights of 23 million. The projected uses of Qurate Retail cash for the remainder of 2024 are continued capital improvement spending between 50 million and 75 million, debt service payments (including approximately 41 million for interest payments on outstanding debt), repayment of debt, and payment of dividends to the holders of the Preferred Stock. We also may be required to make net payments of income tax liabilities to settle items under discussion with tax authorities. We expect that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities and borrowing capacity in future periods will be sufficient to fund projected uses of cash. The Company may from time to time repurchase any level of its outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, redemptions, tender offers or otherwise. Repurchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Qurate Retail and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2024.

The Exchange was accounted for as a debt modification in accordance with U.S. GAAP and fees paid to third parties were recorded as expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in other expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 amounts in millions QxH 1,521 1,617 4,618 4,836 QVC International 571 577 1,719 1,775 Consolidated QVC 2,092 2,194 6,337 6,611 Revenue. QVC's consolidated net revenue decreased 102 million or 4.6 and 274 million or 4.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The three month decrease in net revenue is primarily due to a 3.9 decrease in units shipped attributable to QxH, partially offset by an increase in units shipped at QVC International. The decrease was also driven by a 1.2 decrease in average selling price per unit ("ASP") primarily driven by QVC International, and a 12 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue attributable to QxH. These decreases to net revenue were partially offset by a 38 million decrease in estimated product returns primarily attributable to QxH. The nine month decrease in net revenue is primarily due to a 2.7 decrease in units shipped primarily attributable to QxH, partially offset by an increase in units shipped at QVC International. The decrease was also driven by a 0.9 decrease in ASP primarily attributable to QVC International, partially offset by an increase in ASP at QxH, 49 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and a 19 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue attributable to QxH. These decreases to net revenue were partially offset by a 68 million decrease in estimated product returns primarily driven by QxH. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the changes in revenue and expenses were affected by changes in the exchange rates for the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the U.K. Pound Sterling. In the event the U.S. Dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies in the future, QVC's revenue and operating cash flow will be negatively affected. In discussing QVC s operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates QVC uses to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. QVC calculates the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period's currency exchange rates. QVC refers to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Constant currency operating results refers to operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand QVC s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.

 The percentage change in net revenue for each of QVC's segments in U.S. Dollars and in constant currency was as follows: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 U.S. Dollars Foreign Currency Exchange Impact Constant Currency U.S. Dollars Foreign Currency Exchange Impact Constant currency QxH (5.9) (5.9) (4.5) (4.5) QVC International (1.0) (0.3) (0.7) (3.2) (2.8) (0.4) QxH s net revenue decline of 96 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from a 6.4 decrease in units shipped and an 11 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue. These declines were partially offset by a 30 million decrease in estimated product returns. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QxH's net revenue decline of 218 million resulted from a 5.2 decrease in units shipped, partially offset by a 60 million decrease in estimated product returns and a 0.6 increase in ASP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, QxH experienced shipped sales declines across all product categories. QVC International s net revenue declined 4 million in constant currency for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a 3.0 decrease in ASP across all markets except Japan partially offset by a 1.4 increase in units shipped across all markets except Japan. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, QVC International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in home, accessories and electronics with declines across all other product categories except jewelry which remained flat. QVC International's net revenue declined 7 million in constant currency for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decline was due to a 3.4 decrease in ASP across all markets. These declines were primarily offset by a 3.0 increase in units shipped across all markets except Italy. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QVC International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency across all product categories except for apparel and beauty. Cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation, amortization and fire related costs, net). QVC's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was 65.3 and 64.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 64.9 and 66.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is driven by higher warehouse costs primarily at QxH and to a lesser extent QVC International. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to product margin favorability across both segments and lower freight costs at QxH, partially offset by higher freight costs at QVC International. The product margin favorability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the net impact of merchandising efforts including cost reduction and pricing actions, as well as mix within product categories and less inventory liquidation in the current period at QxH. Operating expenses. QVC's operating expenses are principally comprised of commissions, order processing and customer service expenses, credit card processing fees and telecommunications expenses. Operating expenses were 7.9 of net revenue for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and were 8.0 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases in operating expenses as a percent of sales are driven by lower commissions expense at QxH. Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock based compensation). QVC's selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) include personnel, IT, marketing and advertising expenses, production costs, and provision for doubtful accounts. Such expenses decreased 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased as a percentage of net revenue to 14.8 from 14.4 . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and increased as a percentage of net revenue to 14.8 from 14.6 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was driven by a 4 million decrease in consulting expenses and a 4 million decrease in personnel costs both at QxH. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease resulted from a 32 million decrease in consulting expenses primarily at QxH, a 6

 million decrease in non-income related taxes and 5 million of favorability from foreign exchange rates. These decreases were primarily offset by a 24 million increase in marketing costs at QxH. The decrease in consulting expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to investments in Project Athens made in the prior year. The increase in marketing costs was driven by QVC s Age of Possibility campaign. Restructuring, penalties and fire related (costs), net of recoveries (including Rocky Mount inventory losses) . QVC recorded restructuring costs of 18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the shift in its IT operating model. QVC recorded a loss of 19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a gain of 196 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of recoveries. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the loss was primarily related to a Consumer Product Safety Commission CPSC civil penalty of 16 million (see note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and 5 million of other fire related costs, partially offset by a 2 million gain on the sale of the Rocky Mount property. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain related to a 240 million gain on insurance proceeds received in excess of fire losses and a 17 million gain on the sale of the Rocky Mount property, partially offset by 32 million of other fire related costs, the CPSC civil penalty of 16 million and 13 million of restructuring costs related to workforce reduction. Gains on sales of assets and sale-leaseback transactions. QVC recorded a 1 million gain on sale of assets and sale-leaseback transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the sale-leaseback of a property in Germany. QVC recorded 119 million of gains on sales of assets and sale-leaseback transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the sale-leaseback of two properties located in Germany and the U.K. Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to options and restricted stock units granted to certain officers and employees. QVC recorded 1 million and 15 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and recorded 7 million and 27 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to a decline in the probability of satisfying performance objectives and changes in the market price of Qurate Retail s Series A common stock. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 11 million and 14 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, and included acquisition related amortization of 15 million for both of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 46 million for both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to decreased property and equipment amortization primarily due to assets that are fully depreciated in the current period and a decrease in channel placement amortization and related expenses due to lower subscriber counts, and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in software amortization due to software assets fully depreciating in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by an increase in software amortization due to software additions. CBI. CBI consists of a portfolio of aspirational home and apparel brands. The home brands are comprised of Ballard Designs, Frontgate, and Grandin Road, while Garnet Hill focuses primarily on apparel and accessories and is categorized as an apparel brand. There are also 34 retail and outlet stores located throughout the U.S., primarily comprised of Ballard Designs and Frontgate stores.

The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of a decrease in ASP of 6 related to a product mix shift within the home category to lower priced items, and a decrease in units shipped of 6 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in units shipped was due to softness across home categories. The decrease in net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of a decrease in ASP of 5 related to a product mix shift within the home category to lower priced items, and a decrease in units shipped of 7 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in units shipped was due to softness across the home categories. CBI's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was 59.9 and 62.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 59.1 and 62.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue in both periods were primarily due to lower supply chain costs. Operating expenses are principally comprised of credit card processing fees and customer service expenses, which are variable expenses that support sales activity. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses decreased 1 million and 2 million, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower revenue, as discussed above. CBI s SG A expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) include print, digital and retail marketing. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a percentage of net revenue, these expenses increased from 29.5 to 33.7 , primarily attributable to lower revenue compared to the prior year, as discussed above and increased consulting expenses related to business transformation initiatives. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a percentage of net revenue, these expenses increased from 29.1 to 32.7 , primarily attributable to lower revenue compared to the prior year, as discussed above.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct of operations by our subsidiaries in different foreign countries. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which include investments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate. As of September 30, 2024, our debt is comprised of the following amounts: 

Variable rate debt Fixed rate debt Weighted Weighted Principal average Principal average amount interest rate amount interest rate dollar amounts in millions QVC 1,280 6.5 2,732 5.8 Corporate and other 1,571 6.1 Qurate Retail is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related primarily to the monetary assets and liabilities and the financial results of QVC's foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the statements of operations are generally translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses, which are reflected in income as unrealized (based on period-end translations) or realized upon settlement of the transactions. Cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the period. Accordingly, Qurate Retail may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. QVC's reported Adjusted OIBDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been impacted by approximately 2 million, for every 1 change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar.
