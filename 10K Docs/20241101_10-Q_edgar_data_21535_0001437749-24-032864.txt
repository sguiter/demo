million. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors throughout many areas of the world. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate and represents our best estimate at September 28, 2024, we will continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to our estimates regarding expected credit losses.

million and million at September 28, 2024, and December 30, 2023, respectively. These amounts are recorded within other current assets and other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Implementation costs are amortized using the straight-line method over seven years and we recorded amortization expense of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and amortization expense of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1 each year and have determined there was no impairment as of October 1, 2023, as we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values on that date. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. As of September 28, 2024, we do not believe there were indicators of impairment requiring an interim test. In the event we determine that an interim goodwill impairment review is required in a future period, the review may result in an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. 

During the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, no events or conditions occurred suggesting an impairment in our long-lived assets. 

to months. Parts and labor are typically covered under the terms of the warranty agreement. Our warranty expense accruals are based on historical and estimated costs by product and configuration. From time-to-time we offer customers extended warranties beyond the standard warranty period. In those situations, the revenue relating to the extended warranty is deferred at its estimated relative standalone selling price and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Costs associated with our extended warranty contracts are expensed as incurred.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized foreign exchange losses, net of the impact of foreign exchange derivative contracts, of million and million, respectively, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency and, as a result, their assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements are included as a separate component of stockholders equity.

The following table reconciles the denominators used in computing basic and diluted income per share in thousands) : 

Effect of dilutive securities 

Revenue for established products that have previously satisfied a customer s acceptance requirements is generally recognized upon shipment. In cases where a prior history of customer acceptance cannot be demonstrated and in the case of new products, revenue and cost of sales are deferred until customer acceptance has been received. Our post-shipment obligations typically include standard warranties. Service revenue is recognized over time as we transfer control to our customer for the related contract or upon completion of the services if they are short-term in nature. Spares, contactor and kit revenue is generally recognized upon shipment. 

Certain of our equipment sales have multiple performance obligations that may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time. For arrangements containing multiple performance obligations, the revenue relating to the undelivered performance obligation is deferred using the relative standalone selling price method utilizing estimated sales prices until satisfaction of the deferred performance obligation. 

Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates. At September 28, 2024, we had million of revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) for contracts with original expected durations of over one year. As allowed under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), we have opted to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with original expected durations of less than one year. 

We generally sell our equipment with a product warranty. The product warranty provides assurance to customers that delivered products are as specified in the contract (an assurance-type warranty ). Therefore, we account for such product warranties under ASC Topic 460, Guarantees ASC 460 ), and not as a separate performance obligation. 

The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to customers that are known as of the end of the reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes sales made to certain customers with cumulative tier volume discounts offered. Variable consideration arrangements are rare; however, when they occur, we estimate variable consideration as the expected value to which we expect to be entitled. Included in the transaction price estimate are amounts in which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable consideration that does not meet revenue recognition criteria is deferred. 

Our contracts are typically less than one year in duration and we have elected to use the practical expedient available in ASC 606 to expense cost to obtain contracts as they are incurred because they would be amortized over less than one year. 

Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customer. Payment terms do not exceed one year from the invoice date and therefore do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet in any of the periods presented. 

On shipments where sales are not recognized, gross profit is generally recorded as deferred profit in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, representing the difference between the receivable recorded and the inventory shipped. In certain instances where customer payments are received prior to product shipment, the customer s payments are recorded as customer advances. At September 28, 2024, we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million, current deferred profit of million and deferred profit expected to be recognized after one year included in noncurrent other accrued liabilities of million. At December 30, 2023, we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million, current deferred profit of million and deferred profit expected to be recognized after one year included in noncurrent other accrued liabilities of million.

Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were not significant. 

In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued its final climate disclosure rules, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors , which require all registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The rules require disclosure of, among other things, material climate-related risks, activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks, governance and oversight of such risks, material climate targets and goals, and Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, on a phased-in basis, when those emissions are material. In addition, the final rules require certain disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, including the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions. The rules are effective for us on a phased-in timeline starting in fiscal 2025; however, in April 2024, the SEC issued an order to voluntarily stay its final climate rules pending the completion of judicial review thereof by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We are currently evaluating the impact of the rules on our consolidated financial statements. 

million million) on October 2, 2023, and set up a retention sum liability for potential adjustments to working capital, future tax or insurance claims in the amount of SGD million million) resulting in an initial purchase price of SGD million million). The working capital adjustment was finalized in January 2024 and an additional cash payment was made to EQT owners of SGD million (approximately million) resulting in a purchase price of SGD million million). The retention liability for remaining tax, insurance and other claims as of September 28, 2024, was SGD million million) and is accrued in long term other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The EQT Acquisition has been accounted for in conformity with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , ASC 805 ). 

The acquired assets and liabilities of EQT were recorded at their respective fair values including an amount for goodwill representing the difference between the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable net assets. The purchase price allocation was finalized during the second quarter of 2024. The table below summarizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 2, 2023 in thousands ):

Acquired intangible assets reported above are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which approximates the pattern of how the economic benefit is expected to be used. This includes amounts allocated to customer relationships because of anticipated high customer retention rates that are common in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. 

The value assigned to developed technology was determined by using the relief from royalty method under the income approach, which included assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Developed technology, which comprises products that have reached technological feasibility, includes the products in EQT s product line. The revenue estimates used to value the developed technology were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by EQT and competitors. The estimated after-tax cash flows were based on a hypothetical royalty rate applied to the revenues for the developed technology. The discount rate utilized to discount the net cash flows of the developed technology to present value was based on the risk associated with the respective cash flows taking into consideration the perceived risk of the technology relative to the other acquired assets, the weighted average cost of capital, the internal rate of return, and the weighted average return on assets. 

The value assigned to customer relationships was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The estimated cash flows were based on revenues from the existing customers net of operating expenses and net of contributory asset charges. The discount rate utilized to discount the net cash flows of the customer relationships to present value was based on the respective cash flows taking into consideration the perceived risks. 

The value assigned to backlog acquired was estimated based upon the contractual nature of the backlog as of October 2, 2023, using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog at a discount rate commensurate with the expected risks of the backlog cash flows. 

The value assigned to trademarks and trade names acquired was determined by using the relief from royalty method under the income approach, which included assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. 

EQT s results of operations have been included starting October 2, 2023. The impact of EQT on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) was not material.

Credit Agreement 

On October 1, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement providing for a million Term Loan Credit Facility and borrowed the full amount to finance a portion of the Xcerra acquisition. Loans under the Term Loan Credit Facility amortize in equal quarterly installments of of the original principal amount, with the balance payable at maturity. All outstanding principal and interest in respect of the Term Loan Credit Facility would have been due on or before October 1, 2025. The loans under the Term Loan Credit Facility bore interest, at Cohu s option, at a floating annual rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of . On June 16, 2023, in connection with the discontinuation of LIBOR, we entered into an amendment to our Term Loan Credit Facility, which provided for the transition of the benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR. Effective with the interest period beginning July 1, 2023, LIBOR was replaced with Adjusted Term SOFR , a floating annual rate equal to SOFR plus a margin of . At December 30, 2023, the outstanding loan balance, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was million and million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

On February 9, 2024, we made a cash payment of million to repay the remaining outstanding amounts owed under our Term Loan Credit Facility. We accounted for the transaction as a debt extinguishment, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 we recognized a loss of million due to the recognition of the remaining debt discount and deferred financing costs. During the first nine months of 2023, we repurchased million in principal of our Term Loan Credit Facility for million in cash. This resulted in a loss of million reflected in other expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and a million reduction in debt discounts and deferred financing costs in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Kita Term Loans 

We have a series of term loans with Japanese financial institutions primarily related to the expansion of our facility in Osaka, Japan. The loans are collateralized by the facility and land, carry interest at rates ranging from to , and expire at various dates through 2034. At September 28, 2024, the outstanding loan balance was million and million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At December 30, 2023, the outstanding loan balance was million and million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value at September 28, 2024. 

The term loans are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 

Construction Loans 

In July 2019 and June 2020, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries located in Germany entered into a series of construction loans Loan Facilities with a German financial institution initially providing it with total borrowings of up to million. The Loan Facilities were utilized to finance the expansion of our facility in Kolbermoor, Germany and are secured by the land and the existing building on the site. The Loan Facilities bear interest at agreed upon rates based on the facility amounts as discussed below. 

The first facility totaling million has been fully drawn and is payable over years at a fixed annual interest rate of . Principal and interest payments are due each quarter over the duration of the facility ending in September 2029. The second facility totaling million has been fully drawn and is payable over years at an annual interest rate of , which is fixed until April 2027. Principal and interest payments are due each month over the duration of the facility ending in January 2034. The third facility totaling million has been fully drawn and is payable over years at an annual interest rate of . Principal and interest payments are due each month over the duration of the facility ending in May 2030. 

At September 28, 2024, total outstanding borrowings under the Loan Facilities was million with million of the total outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At December 30, 2023, total outstanding borrowings under the Loan Facilities was million with million of the total outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The loans are denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value at September 28, 2024. 

Lines of Credit 

As a result of our acquisition of Kita, we assumed a series of revolving credit facilities with various financial institutions in Japan. The credit facilities renew monthly and provide Kita with access to working capital totaling up to million Japanese Yen of which million Japanese Yen was drawn as of September 28, 2024. At September 28, 2024, total borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit were million. As these credit facility agreements renew monthly, they have been included in short-term borrowings in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The revolving lines of credit are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 

Our wholly owned subsidiary in Switzerland has one available line of credit which provides borrowings of up to a total of million Swiss Francs, a portion of which is reserved for tax guarantees. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit.

Accounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of our investments, and they are included in Level 1. When quoted market prices are unobservable, we use quotes from independent pricing vendors based on recent trading activity and other relevant information, and they are included in Level 2.

shares available for future equity grants under the 2005 Plan and shares available for purchase under the ESPP. 

Stock Options 

Stock options may be granted to employees, consultants and non-employee directors to purchase a fixed number of shares of our common stock. The exercise prices of options granted are at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the dates of grant and options vest and become exercisable in annual increments that range from one to four years from the date of grant. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan have a maximum contractual term of ten years. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we did not grant any stock options and as of September 28, 2024, no stock options were exercisable and outstanding. 

Restricted Stock Units 

We grant restricted stock units RSUs to certain employees, consultants and directors. RSUs vest in annual increments that range from one to four years from the date of grant. Prior to vesting, RSUs do not have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding. Shares of our common stock will be issued on the date the RSUs vest net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the number of RSUs outstanding on September 28, 2024. 

In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we awarded RSUs and issued shares of our common stock on vesting of previously granted awards and RSUs were forfeited. On September 28, 2024, we had RSUs outstanding with an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately million and the weighted average remaining vesting period was approximately years. 

Performance Stock Units 

We grant performance stock units PSUs to certain senior executives as a part of our long-term equity compensation program. The number of shares of common stock that will ultimately be issued to settle PSUs granted ranges from to of the number granted and is determined based on certain performance criteria over a three-year measurement period. The performance criteria for the PSUs are based on a combination of our annualized Total Shareholder Return TSR for the performance period and the relative performance of our TSR compared with the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) for the performance period. PSUs granted vest on the third anniversary of their grant, assuming achievement of the applicable performance criteria. 

We estimate the fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent applicable performance conditions are satisfied, shares of our common stock are issued on the date the PSUs vest net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of PSUs outstanding on September 28, 2024. 

In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we awarded PSUs, we issued shares of our common stock on vesting of previously granted awards and shares were forfeited. On September 28, 2024, we had PSUs outstanding with an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately million and the weighted average remaining vesting period was approximately years. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The ESPP provides for the issuance of shares of our common stock. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase shares of Cohu common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to percent of the lower of the fair market value of Cohu common stock at the beginning or end of each 6-month purchase offering period, subject to certain limits. The two offering periods run from November 1 through April 30 and May 1 through October 31, respectively. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, shares of our common stock were sold to our employees under the ESPP.

million share repurchase program. This share repurchase program was effective as of November 2, 2021, and has no expiration date. On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional million under the share repurchase program. The timing of share repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. Repurchases under this program will be made using our existing cash resources and may be commenced or suspended from time-to-time at our discretion without prior notice. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through 10b5-1 programs, or in privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market rates in accordance with federal securities laws. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for million to be held as treasury stock. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for million to be held as treasury stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock for million to be held as treasury stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock for million to be held as treasury stock. As of September 28, 2024, million remained available for us to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we executed an agreement to purchase our leased facility in Malaysia for MYR million, with the expectation that the title would transfer during 2024. We treated this transaction as a lease modification, and changed the classification to a finance lease, reducing our operating lease assets and liabilities by million and increasing our finance lease assets and current lease liabilities by million and million, respectively. Due to a seller-imposed delay in the completion of purchase of this facility to 2025, which occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the finance lease was modified resulting in the asset increasing to million. At September 28, 2024, the finance lease liability increased million to million, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from management s current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors . The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the time they are made, and do not necessarily reflect management s outlook at any other point in time. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or for any other reason, however, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth in other reports or documents we file from time to time with the SEC after the date of this Quarterly Report. This Form 10-Q also contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business, and the markets for certain of our products. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained this industry, business, market, and other data from reports, research surveys, studies, and similar data prepared by market research firms and other third parties, industry, and general publications, government data, and similar sources. 

OVERVIEW 

Cohu is a leading supplier of test and inspection metrology automation systems, MEMS test modules, test contactors, thermal subsystems, data analytics software to optimize manufacturing yield and productivity, and automated test equipment (ATE) used by global semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors. We offer a wide range of products and services and our revenue from capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure and operating budgets of our customers, who often abruptly delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of expenditure by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and the products that incorporate them. Our recurring products are driven by the number of semiconductor devices that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and new technologies by our customers. As a result, our recurring products provide a more stable recurring source of revenue and generally do not have the same degree of cyclicality as our capital equipment products. 

On January 30, 2023, we completed the acquisition of MCT, a U.S.-based company. MCT provides automated solutions for the semiconductor industry and designs, manufactures, markets, services and distributes strip test handlers, film frame handlers and laser mark handlers. On October 2, 2023, we acquired EQT, a Singapore-based company. EQT is a provider of semiconductor test contactors and other test consumables. MCT and EQT are included in Cohu s consolidated results of operations as of each date of acquisition. 

During 2023 and into the first nine months of fiscal 2024, global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors impacted the semiconductor industry. In response to the higher cost of capital and slowing demand, and above targeted inventory levels, many chip companies have been cutting costs, reducing employee headcount, and pushing out capital expenditures for additional capacity. For the third quarter ended September 28, 2024, on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis, our consolidated net sales declined 9.0 to 95.3 million due to lower demand in automotive, industrial, and mobile applications, driven by these global economic conditions. 

We continue to focus on building a well-balanced and resilient business model, executing on customer design-wins and in developing innovative products. Our long-term market drivers and market strategy remain intact, and we are encouraged by increased use of semiconductors including the most recent developments in artificial intelligence AI ), along with customer traction with our new products. We continue to capture new customers and new opportunities and remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business due to the increasing ubiquity of semiconductors, increasing semiconductor complexity, increasing quality demands from semiconductor customers, increasing test intensity, increasing focus on automation and Industry 4.0 initiatives, and continued proliferation of electronics in a variety of products across the automotive, mobile, industrial, computing, and consumer markets.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

September 28, 2024

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Our critical accounting estimates that we believe are the most important to investors understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment include: 

revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to customers, which impacts our results of operations; 

estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities, specifically inventory reserves, which impact gross margin or operating expenses; 

the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, unrecognized tax benefits, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and accounting for the impact of the change to U.S. tax law as described herein, which impact our tax provision; and 

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill and other intangible assets, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses if we are required to record impairments of assets or accelerate their depreciation. 

Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. 

Revenue Recognition: Our net sales are derived from the sale of products and services and are adjusted for estimated returns and allowances, which historically have been insignificant. We recognize revenue when the obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of our systems and non-system products or the completion of services. In circumstances where control is not transferred until destination or acceptance, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. Revenue for established products that have previously satisfied a customer s acceptance requirements is generally recognized upon shipment. In cases where a prior history of customer acceptance cannot be demonstrated and in the case of new products, revenue and cost of sales are deferred until customer acceptance has been received. Our post-shipment obligations typically include standard warranties. Service revenue is recognized over time as the transfer of control is completed for the related contract or upon completion of the services if they are short-term in nature. Spares, contactor and kit revenue is generally recognized upon shipment. Certain of our equipment sales have multiple performance obligations. These arrangements involve the delivery or performance of multiple performance obligations, that may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time. For arrangements containing multiple performance obligations, the revenue relating to the undelivered performance obligation is deferred using the relative standalone selling price method utilizing estimated sales prices until satisfaction of the deferred performance obligation. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates. On September 28, 2024, we had 5.8 million of revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) with expected durations of over one year. As allowed under ASC 606, we have opted not to disclose unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with original expected durations of less than one year. We generally sell our equipment with a product warranty. The product warranty provides assurance to customers that delivered products are as specified in the contract (an assurance-type warranty ). Therefore, we account for such product warranties under ASC 460, and not as a separate performance obligation. The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to customers that are known as of the end of the reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes sales made to certain customers with cumulative tier volume discounts offered. Variable consideration arrangements are rare; however, when they occur, we estimate variable consideration as the expected value to which we expect to be entitled. Included in the transaction price estimate are amounts in which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. This estimate is based on information available for projected future sales. Variable consideration that does not meet revenue recognition criteria is deferred. Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customer. Payments terms do not exceed one year from the invoice date and therefore do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet in any of the periods presented. On shipments where sales are not recognized, gross profit is generally recorded as deferred profit in the condensed consolidated balance sheet representing the difference between the receivable recorded and the inventory shipped.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

September 28, 2024

Accounts Receivable: We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors throughout many areas of the world. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate and represents our best estimate of future losses, we will continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to our estimates. 

Inventory: The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The demand forecast is a direct input in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans. We record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand, market conditions and product selling prices. If future product demand, market conditions or product selling prices are less than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements, increases to inventory reserves may be required which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 

Income Taxes: We estimate our liability for income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our (i) current taxes; (ii) temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes and (iii) unrecognized tax benefits. Temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Establishing, reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period generally results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations. We must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, unrecognized tax benefits and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets consist primarily of research and development costs that are required to be capitalized under IRC Section 174, net of related amortization, reserves and accruals that are not yet deductible for tax, and tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards. 

Segment Information: We applied the provisions of ASC 280, which sets forth a management approach to segment reporting and establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products, major customers and the geographies in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. An operating segment is defined as a component that engages in business activities whose operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. We have determined that our three identified operating segments are: THG, STG and ISG. Our THG, STG and ISG operating segments qualify for aggregation under ASC 280 due to similarities in their customers, their economic characteristics, and the nature of products and services provided. As a result, we report in one segment, Semiconductor Test Inspection. 

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-lived Assets: We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value of goodwill, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology to derive an indication of value, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance metrics of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain an indication of value. We then apply a 50/50 weighting to the indicated values from the income and market approaches to derive the fair values of the reporting units. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on customer forecasts, industry trade organization data and general economic conditions. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

September 28, 2024

We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1st of each year and have determined there was no impairment as of October 1, 2023, as we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values on that date. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. As of September 28, 2024, we do not believe there were indicators of impairment requiring an interim test. In the event we determine that an interim goodwill impairment review is required in a future period, the review may result in an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. 

During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, no events or conditions occurred suggesting an impairment in our long-lived assets. 

Warranty: We provide for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized. Our warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels, product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems. Should product performance, material usage or labor repair costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. 

Contingencies: We are subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of our businesses which require us to assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset. If a loss or asset impairment is probable and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable, we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known. 

Share-based Compensation: Share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit. When granted, share-based compensation on performance stock units with market-based goals is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of the grant. Share-based compensation expense related to stock options is recorded based on the fair value of the award on its grant date, which we estimate using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023 

Net Sales 

Our consolidated net sales decreased 36.8 to 95.3 million in 2024, compared to 150.8 million in 2023 primarily due to the current global macroeconomic environment, which is driving lower demand for automotive, industrial, computing, and mobile applications. Consolidated net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 include 3.0 million of net sales of EQT, which Cohu acquired on October 2, 2023. 

Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below) 

Gross margin consists of net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of materials, assembly, test labor, and overhead from operations. Our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and volume of products sold, product support costs, changes in inventory reserves, the sale of previously reserved inventory and business volume which impacts the utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Our gross margin, as a percentage of net sales for the third fiscal quarter, was 46.8 in 2024 and 47.0 in 2023. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our gross margin declined slightly due to lower business volume impacting our ability to leverage fixed costs. 

We compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using inventory usage forecasts. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded charges to cost of sales of 0.8 million and 1.0 million for excess and obsolete inventory, respectively. We believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value are adequate to cover known exposures as of September 28, 2024. Further reductions in customer forecasts, continued modifications to products, or our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements, may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods. 

Research and Development Expense R D Expense 

R D expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research, product design and development activities, costs of engineering materials and supplies and professional consulting expenses. R D expense was 20.3 million in fiscal 2024 and 21.5 million in fiscal 2023 representing 21.3 and 14.2 of net sales, respectively. During the third fiscal quarter of 2024 R D expenses decreased due to lower spending on material costs associated with new product development and lower incentive compensation due to current business conditions. Our R D costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 included 0.4 million of incremental costs from EQT. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense SG A Expense 

SG A expense consists primarily of salaries and benefit costs of employees, commission expense for independent sales representatives, product promotion and costs of professional services. SG A expense was 30.3 million or 31.8 of net sales in fiscal 2024, compared to 32.4 million or 21.5 in fiscal 2023. The increase in SG A expense as a percentage of net sales is a result of lower sales in fiscal 2024. SG A expense during the third fiscal quarter of 2024 was down on a year-over-year basis due to lower incentive compensation due to current business conditions. SG A expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 also includes 0.5 million of one-time severance costs resulting from manufacturing transition related to the expansion of our factories in the Philippines and Malaysia and 0.7 million of incremental SG A costs from the operations of EQT. The third quarter of fiscal 2023 included 0.4 million of incremental SG A costs from the operations of MCT and 0.8 million of transaction related costs incurred specifically related to the acquisitions of MCT and EQT. No transaction costs were incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets 

Amortization of purchased intangibles is the process of expensing the cost of an intangible asset acquired through a business combination over the projected life of the asset. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 9.8 million and 8.9 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 resulted from the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the acquisition of EQT. 

Restructuring Charges 

During the first quarter of 2023, we began a strategic restructuring and integration program in connection with the acquisition of MCT. Restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 related to the integration of MCT which was acquired on January 30, 2023 totaled 0.7 million. Amounts for restructuring recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were not material. 

See Note 4, Restructuring Charges in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to restructuring charges. 

Interest Expense and Income 

Interest expense was 0.1 million and 0.8 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. On February 9, 2024, we repaid the remaining outstanding amounts owed under our Term Loan Credit Facility. The payoff of our Term Loan Credit Facility resulted in lower interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. 

Interest income was 2.6 million and 3.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest income year-over-year is a result of lower investment balances in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 resulting from the repayment of the Term Loan Credit Facility. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. The provision or benefit for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate ETR used for interim periods is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for the tax effect of items required to be recorded discretely in the interim periods in which those items occur. Our ETR is different than the statutory rate in the U.S. due to foreign income taxed at different rates than the U.S., generation of tax credits, changes in uncertain tax benefit positions, changes to valuation allowances, and the impact of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI and the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax BEAT ). In addition, we have numerous tax holidays related to our manufacturing operations in Malaysia and the Philippines. The tax holiday periods expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays. 

Our third quarter 2024 ETR reflects the impact of certain foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate and an increase in the U.S. valuation allowance, primarily attributable to capitalized research and development costs and intangible assets. 

We conduct business globally and as a result, Cohu or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the US and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examinations by taxing authorities throughout the world and are currently under examination in Germany, the Philippines, Malaysia and California. We believe our financial statement accruals for income taxes are appropriate. 

In accordance with the disclosure requirements as described in ASC 740, we have classified unrecognized tax benefits as non-current income tax liabilities, or a reduction in non-current deferred tax assets, unless expected to be paid within one year. Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 

Net Income (Loss) 

As a result of the factors set forth above, our net loss was 18.1 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our net income was 3.9 million. 

First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 Compared to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023 

Net Sales 

Our consolidated net sales decreased 38.4 to 307.7 million in 2024, compared to 499.1 million in 2023 due to the current global macroeconomic environment, which is driving lower demand for automotive, industrial, computing, and mobile applications. Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 include 11.7 million of net sales of EQT, which Cohu acquired on October 2, 2023.

September 28, 2024

Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below) 

Our gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 45.8 in 2024 from 47.5 in 2023 due to lower business volume impacting our ability to leverage fixed costs. 

In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 we recorded charges to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventory of approximately 2.8 million and 4.0 million, respectively. We believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover known exposures as of September 28, 2024. Reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products, or our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our results of operations and gross margin in future periods. 

R D Expense 

R D expense was 64.0 million or 20.8 of net sales in 2024, compared to 66.5 million or 13.3 in 2023. R D expense decreased during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 due to lower spending on material costs associated with new product development during the current year and lower incentive compensation due to current business conditions. The first nine months of fiscal 2024 included 1.3 million of incremental costs from EQT. 

SG A Expense 

SG A expense was 97.5 million or 31.7 of net sales in 2024, compared to 99.4 million or 19.9 in 2023. The increase in SG A expense as a percentage of net sales is a result of lower sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. SG A expense during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was down on a year-over-year basis due to lower incentive compensation due to current business conditions. SG A expense during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 includes 3.4 million of one-time severance costs resulting from manufacturing transition related to the expansion of our factories in the Philippines and Malaysia, a 0.9 million impairment charge related to our investment in Fraes-und Technologiezentrum GmbH Frasdorf FTZ ), a company based in Germany that provides milling services to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, 2.4 million of incremental SG A costs from the operations of EQT, and 0.2 million of transaction costs related to our acquisition of MCT and EQT. The first nine months of fiscal 2023 included 1.3 million of transaction related costs incurred specifically related to the acquisitions of MCT and EQT. 

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets 

Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 29.3 million and 26.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense recorded during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was a result of the amortization of acquired intangible assets from MCT and EQT. 

Restructuring Charges 

We recorded restructuring charges totaling 2.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Amounts recorded related to restructuring in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were not material. Costs incurred in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 relate to the integration of MCT which was acquired on January 30, 2023. 

See Note 4, Restructuring Charges in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to restructuring charges. 

Interest Expense and Income 

Interest expense was 0.5 million and 2.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. On February 9, 2024, we repaid the remaining outstanding amounts owed under our Term Loan Credit Facility. We accounted for the transaction as a debt extinguishment, which resulted in us recognizing a loss of 0.2 million to write-off all remaining debt discount and deferred financing costs. The payoff of our Term Loan Credit Facility has resulted in lower interest expense in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. 

Interest income was 7.7 million and 8.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower cash and investment balances in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 due to the repayment of the Term Loan Credit Facility.

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. The provision or benefit for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate ETR used for interim periods is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for the tax effect of items required to be recorded discretely in the interim periods in which those items occur.

In addition, we have numerous tax holidays related to our manufacturing operations in Malaysia and the Philippines. The tax holiday periods expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays. 

The ETR on income for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 reflects the impact of certain foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate and an increase in the U.S. valuation allowance attributable to capitalized research and development costs, offset by a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. 

We conduct business globally and as a result, Cohu or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the US and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examinations by taxing authorities throughout the world and are currently under examination in Germany, the Philippines, Malaysia and California. We believe our financial statement accruals for income taxes are appropriate. 

In accordance with the disclosure requirements in ASC 740, we have classified unrecognized tax benefits as non-current income tax liabilities, or a reduction in non-current deferred tax assets, unless expected to be paid within one year. Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. There was a material reduction to our unrecognized tax benefits in certain foreign tax jurisdictions during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. There were no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Income (Loss) 

As a result of the factors set forth above, our net loss was 48.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net income was 30.2 million. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our business is dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors that are, in turn, dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors. The cyclical, seasonal and volatile nature of demand for semiconductor equipment, our primary industry, makes estimates of future revenues, results of operations and net cash flows difficult. 

Our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by operations and we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity. We use cash to fund growth in our operating assets and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development. As of September 28, 2024, 125.1 million or 66.1 of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes if we repatriate these funds. Except for working capital requirements in certain jurisdictions, we provide for all withholding and other residual taxes related to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. 

At September 28, 2024, our total indebtedness, net of discount and deferred financing costs, included 1.9 million outstanding under Kita s term loans, 7.2 million outstanding under Cohu GmbH s construction loan and 1.4 million outstanding under Kita s lines of credit. On February 9, 2024, we made a cash payment of 29.3 million to repay the remaining outstanding amounts owed under our Term Loan Credit Facility and we repurchased 915,504 shares of our outstanding common stock, to be held as treasury stock, for 27.0 million, during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

We believe that our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products. In addition, we may make acquisitions or increase our capital expenditures and may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund these activities. Additional financing may not be available or not available on terms favorable to us.

Cash Flows 

Operating Activities: Operating cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 consisted of our net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. These adjustments include impairment charges, depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment, share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, deferred income taxes, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, impairment charge on equity investment, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs and sales of property, plant and equipment. Our net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 totaled 4.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by changes in current assets and liabilities and included an increase in other current assets of 14.5 million and decreases in accounts receivable of 32.5 million, accounts payable of 10.8 million, accrued compensation, warranty and other liabilities of 9.0 million, inventory of 8.1 million and income taxes payable of 3.8 million. Other current assets, which includes prepaids and income taxes receivable, increased from prepayments of certain expenses that will be utilized throughout fiscal 2024 and the timing difference of accrual and receipt of income taxes. The decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable were a result of the timing of cash collections on net sales recognized and payments made to suppliers during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Accrued compensation, warranty and other liabilities decreased due to payments of incentive compensation related to the prior year that were paid in the first quarter of 2024 and lower accruals made during the current year period. Inventory decreased due to a reduction in purchases in response to current business conditions and the income taxes payable decrease was driven by payments. 

Investing Activities: Investing cash flows consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures in support of our business, purchases of investments, business acquisitions and proceeds from investment maturities, and asset disposals and business divestitures. Our net cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 totaled 3.7 million. We generated 76.8 million from sales and maturities and used 65.6 million of cash for purchases of short-term investments in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We invest our excess cash, in an attempt to seek the highest available return while preserving capital, in short-term investments since excess cash may be required for a business-related purpose. Additions to property, plant and equipment in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 of 7.6 million, which were made to support our operating and development activities and include amounts related to the expansion of our factories in the Philippines and Malaysia. 

Financing Activities: Financing cash flows consist primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and repayments of debt. We issue restricted stock units, including performance stock units, and maintain an employee stock purchase plan as components of our overall employee compensation. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, cash used to settle the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements on behalf of our employees upon vesting of restricted and performance stock awards, net of proceeds from shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan, was 2.6 million. We made payments totaling 27.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 for shares of our common stock repurchased under our share repurchase program to be held as treasury stock. Repayments of debt during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 totaled 30.4 million. 

Share Repurchase Program 

On October 28, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 70 million share repurchase program. This share repurchase program was effective as of November 2, 2021, and has no expiration date. On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 70 million under the share repurchase program. The timing of share repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. Repurchases under this program will be made using our existing cash resources and may be commenced or suspended from time-to-time at our discretion without prior notice. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through 10b5-1 programs, or in privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market rates in accordance with federal securities laws. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased 915,504 shares of our common stock for 27.0 million to be held as treasury stock. As of September 28, 2024, 31.4 million remained available for us to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program.

Capital Resources 

We have access to credit facilities and other borrowings provided by financial institutions to finance acquisitions, capital expenditures and our operations if needed. A summary of our borrowings and available credit is as follows. 

Credit Agreement 

On October 1, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement providing for a 350.0 million Term Loan Credit Facility and borrowed the full amount to finance a portion of the Xcerra acquisition. Loans under the Term Loan Credit Facility amortize in equal quarterly installments of 0.25 of the original principal amount, with the balance payable at maturity. All outstanding principal and interest in respect of the Term Loan Credit Facility would have been due on or before October 1, 2025. The loans under the Term Loan Credit Facility bore interest, at Cohu s option, at a floating annual rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00 . On June 16, 2023, in connection with the discontinuation of LIBOR, we entered into an amendment to our Term Loan Credit Facility, which provided for the transition of the benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR. Effective with the interest period beginning July 1, 2023, LIBOR was replaced with Adjusted Term SOFR, a floating annual rate equal to SOFR plus a margin of 3.0 . At December 30, 2023, the outstanding loan balance, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was 29.1 million and 3.4 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

On February 9, 2024, we made a cash payment of 29.3 million to repay the remaining outstanding amounts owed under our Term Loan Credit Facility. We accounted for the transaction as a debt extinguishment, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 we recognized a loss of 0.2 million due to the recognition of the remaining debt discount and deferred financing costs. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased 34.1 million in principal of our Term Loan Credit Facility for 34.1 million in cash. This resulted in a loss of 0.4 million reflected in other expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and a corresponding 0.4 million reduction in debt discounts and deferred financing costs in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Kita Term Loans 

We have a series of term loans with Japanese financial institutions primarily related to the expansion of our facility in Osaka, Japan. The loans are collateralized by the facility and land, carry interest at rates ranging from 0.05 to 0.69 , and expire at various dates through 2034. At September 28, 2024, the outstanding loan balance was 1.9 million and 0.2 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At December 30, 2023, the outstanding loan balance was 2.1 million and 0.2 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The term loans are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 

Construction Loans 

In July 2019 and June 2020, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries located in Germany entered into a series of Loan Facilities with a German financial institution providing it with total borrowings of up to 10.1 million. The Loan Facilities were utilized to finance the expansion of our facility in Kolbermoor, Germany and are secured by the land and the existing building on the site. The Loan Facilities bear interest at agreed upon rates based on the facility amounts as discussed below. 

The first facility totaling 3.4 million has been fully drawn and is payable over 10 years at a fixed annual interest rate of 0.8 . Principal and interest payments are due each quarter over the duration of the facility ending in September 2029. The second facility totaling 5.2 million has been fully drawn and is payable over 15 years at an annual interest rate of 1.05 , which is fixed until April 2027. Principal and interest payments are due each month over the duration of the facility ending in January 2034. The third facility totaling 0.9 million has been fully drawn and is payable over 10 years at an annual interest rate of 1.2 . Principal and interest payments are due each month over the duration of the facility ending in May 2030. 

At September 28, 2024, total outstanding borrowings under the Loan Facilities was 7.2 million with 1.0 million of the total outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At December 30, 2023, total outstanding borrowings under the Loan Facilities was 7.7 million with 1.0 million of the total outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The loans are denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value at September 28, 2024.

Lines of Credit 

As a result of our acquisition of Kita, we assumed a series of revolving credit facilities with various financial institutions in Japan. The credit facilities renew monthly and provide Kita with access to working capital totaling up to 960 million Japanese Yen of which 200 million Japanese Yen is drawn. At September 28, 2024, total borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit were 1.4 million. As these credit facility agreements renew monthly, they have been included in short-term borrowings in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The revolving lines of credit are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 

Our wholly owned subsidiary in Switzerland has one available line of credit which provides it with borrowings of up to a total of 2.0 million Swiss Francs, a portion of which is reserved for tax guarantees. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit. 

We also have a letter of credit facility LC Facility under which Bank of America, N.A., has agreed to administer the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The LC Facility requires us to maintain deposits of cash or other approved investments in amounts that approximate our outstanding letters of credit and contains customary restrictive covenants. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Xcerra, has arrangements with various financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees. As of September 28, 2024, 0.5 million was outstanding under standby letters of credit and bank guarantees. 

We expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Contractual Obligations: Our significant contractual obligations consist of liabilities for debt, operating leases, unrecognized tax benefits, pensions, post-retirement benefits and warranties. On February 9, 2024, we made a cash payment of 29.3 million to repay the remaining outstanding amounts owed under our Term Loan Credit Facility. Aside from the repayment of the remaining outstanding principal of our Term Loan Credit Facility, there were no material changes to these obligations outside the ordinary course of business from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 

Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers: From time to time, we enter into commitments with our vendors and outsourcing partners to purchase inventory at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons. We typically do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required. As of September 28, 2024, 0.5 million was outstanding under standby letters of credit. 

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Investment and Interest Rate Risk. 

At September 28, 2024, our investment portfolio included short-term fixed-income investment securities with a fair value of approximately 80.0 million, and we did not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will likely decline in value if interest rates increase. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. As we classify our short-term securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be credit-related. Due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio, an immediate ten percent change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We evaluate our investments periodically for possible other-than-temporary losses by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. As of September 28, 2024, the cost and fair value of investments we held with loss positions were both approximately 11.5 million. We evaluated the nature of these investments, credit worthiness of the issuer and the duration of these impairments to determine if a credit loss exists. We have the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. 

We have operations in several foreign countries and conduct business in the local currency in these countries. As a result, we have risk associated with currency fluctuations as the value of foreign currencies fluctuate against the U.S. Dollar, in particular the Swiss Franc, Euro, Malaysian Ringgit, Chinese Yuan, Philippine Peso and Japanese Yen. These fluctuations can impact our reported earnings. 

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with a financial institution to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain existing U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities at our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. Under this program, our strategy is to have increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures mitigated by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with foreign currency transaction gains or losses. 

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the U.S. Dollar amount of our net investment in foreign operations and in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 we began hedging foreign currency risk associated with net investment positions in certain of our foreign subsidiaries by entering foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of net investment. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the U.S. Dollar amount of our net investment in foreign operations. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at an average exchange rate during the period which approximates the rates in effect at the transaction dates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. As a result of fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. Dollar as of September 28, 2024, compared to December 30, 2023, our stockholders equity decreased by 2.9 million as a result of the foreign currency translation. 

Based upon the current levels of net foreign assets, a hypothetical 10 devaluation of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these currencies as of September 28, 2024 would result in an approximate 30.1 million positive translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity. Conversely, a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these currencies as of September 28, 2024 would result in an approximate 30.1 million negative translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity.

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures. 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

On October 28, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 70 million share repurchase program. This share repurchase program was effective as of November 2, 2021, and has no expiration date. On October 25, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 70 million under the share repurchase program. The timing of share repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. Repurchases under this program will be made using our existing cash resources and may be commenced or suspended from time-to-time at our discretion without prior notice. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through 10b5-1 programs, or in privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market rates in accordance with federal securities laws. All such repurchased shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for at trade date using the cost method. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased 315,000 shares of our common stock for 8.1 million to be held as treasury stock. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased 915,504 shares of our common stock for 27.0 million to be held as treasury stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 133,100 shares of our common stock for 4.7 million to be held as treasury stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 309,985 shares of our common stock for 10.9 million to be held as treasury stock. As of September 28, 2024, 31.4 million remained available for us to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program.
