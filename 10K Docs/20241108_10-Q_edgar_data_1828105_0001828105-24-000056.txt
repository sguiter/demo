CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Hippo Holdings Inc. Hippo, the Company, we, us and our contains statements that are forward-looking and as such are not historical facts. This includes, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for our future operations. These statements constitute projections, forecasts and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, strive, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include, for example, statements about: 
 
 our future results of operations and financial condition and our ability to attain profitability; 
 our ability to grow our business and, if such growth occurs, to effectively manage such growth; 
 customer satisfaction and our ability to attract, retain, and expand our customer base; 
 our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation; 
 our business strategy, including our diversified distribution strategy and our plans to expand into new markets and new products;

 our ability to maintain reinsurance contracts and our near- and long-term strategies and expectations with respect to cession of insurance risk; 
 our ability to utilize our proprietary technology;

 our ability to stay in compliance with laws and regulations that currently apply, or become applicable, to our business both in the United States and internationally; 
 our public securities liquidity and trading; and 
 other factors detailed in the section titled Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our reputation. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we cannot guarantee that the future 

results, levels of activity, performance, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur at all. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed in Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as other documents that may be filed by us from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed as exhibits to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by these cautionary statements.

 third-party reinsurer and expects to retain approximately of the premium and associated risk, before purchasing catastrophic protection. All reinsurance obligations are appropriately collateralized. The reinsurance contract is subject to contingent commission adjustments and limited loss participation features, which align the Company s interests with those of the reinsurers. 
 For the Company s primary homeowners reinsurance treaty for policies with effective dates in 2023, the Company secured proportional reinsurance from a diverse panel of third-party reinsurers. All reinsurers are either rated A- Excellent or better by AM Best, or the reinsurance is appropriately collateralized. In 2023, the Company retained approximately of the premium through its insurance company subsidiaries or its captive reinsurance company, RH Solutions Insurance (Cayman) Ltd. RHS ), before purchasing catastrophe protection. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company elected to cut off of the reinsurer s participation on the 2023 proportional reinsurance treaty and retain the remaining exposure and related premiums. 
 For business produced through the Company s builder channel for policies with effective dates in 2023, the Company purchased proportional reinsurance from third-party reinsurers. All reinsurers are rated A- Excellent or better by AM Best, or the reinsurance is appropriately collateralized. In 2023, the Company retained approximately of the premium produced through the Company s insurance company subsidiaries or RHS, before purchasing catastrophe protection. 
 For the Company s primary homeowners reinsurance treaty for policies with effective dates in 2022, the Company secured proportional reinsurance from a diverse panel of third-party reinsurers with AM Best ratings of A- Excellent or better. A total of approximately of the premium was retained through the Company s insurance company subsidiaries, including the Company s captive reinsurance company, RHS. 
 The Company also seeks to further reduce its risk retention through purchases of non-proportional reinsurance described below. 
 Non-Proportional Reinsurance Hippo Home Insurance Program 
 The Company purchases non-proportional XOL reinsurance which includes traditional reinsurance protection, state subsidized reinsurance protection, catastrophe bonds, and industry loss warranty products. Through the Company s insurance company subsidiaries, the Company is exposed to the risk of natural catastrophe events that could occur on the risks arising from policies underwritten by the Company or other managing general agents MGAs ). The Company is also exposed to this risk through its captive reinsurer, which takes on a share of the risk underwritten by the Company s MGA business. 
 In May 2023, the Company secured new catastrophe protection through a per occurrence XOL reinsurance agreement with Mountain Re Ltd. Mountain Re ), an independent Bermuda company, licensed as a Special Purpose Insurer. The reinsurance agreement meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance contracts. In connection with the reinsurance agreement, Mountain Re issued notes (generally referred to as catastrophe bonds to investors, consistent with the amount of coverage provided under the reinsurance agreement. The reinsurance agreement provides the Company with coverage through June 2026, and pursuant to the agreement, Mountain Re provides XOL reinsurance coverage to the Company for

 . In 2024, the Company increased its purchase of non-proportional XOL reinsurance, raising the per occurrence XOL limit by and increasing the number of participating reinsurers from to . Under this placement, along with other existing catastrophe protections, the Company is protected on the upper layers of risk up to at least a 1 in 250-year event when considering the Mountain Re per occurrence, described above, corporate catastrophe, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the FHCF XOL described below under Other Reinsurance. The reinsurance protects the Company from all but the most severe catastrophic events. 
 Other Reinsurance 
 Spinnaker Insurance Company Spinnaker purchases reinsurance for programs written by MGAs other than Hippo through its Insurance-as-a-Service business. The reinsurance treaties are a mix of proportional and XOL in which generally to of the risk, up to at least the 1 in 250 year return period, is ceded. The reinsurance contracts are subject to variable commission adjustments and loss participation features, including loss caps, which may increase the amount of losses retained by the Company in excess of the Company s pro-rata participation. Such provisions are recognized in the period based on the experience to date under the agreement. 
 Spinnaker purchases a corporate catastrophe XOL program that attaches above the individual programmatic reinsurance programs protecting the property business written by Hippo as well as the other MGAs. This treaty has a floating retention and attaches at the exhaustion point of the underlying programs specific reinsurance. The catastrophe bond, and the FHCFs, described below, inures to the benefit of this contract. This program provides the Company protection from catastrophes that could impact a large number of correlated insurance policies underwritten by the Company and its other MGAs. The Company buys this XOL so that the probability of losses from a single occurrence across the property portfolio exceeding the protection purchased is no more than , or equivalent to a 1 in 250-year return period. This reinsurance protects the Company from all but the most severe catastrophic events. 
 Spinnaker also purchases reinsurance from the State Board of Administration in Florida via the FHCF annually for admitted residential hurricane losses in Florida. This coverage is provided by the State of Florida and protects business written by Hippo as well as other MGAs that produce admitted residential policies. The Company currently purchases reimbursement protection at the maximum level of mandatory coverage offered by the FHCF. 
 With all reinsurance programs, the Company s wholly owned insurance carriers are not relieved of their primary obligations to policyholders in the event of a default or the insolvency of their reinsurers. As a result, credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer fails to meet its obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To mitigate this exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, the Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and, in certain circumstances, holds substantial collateral (in the form of funds withheld, qualified trusts, and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. material allowance has been recorded in the three and

 Share Repurchases 
 In March 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to million of its common stock, with no expiration date. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at the Company s discretion depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its common stock under this authorization. This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the Company s discretion. share repurchases were made under this program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, million of common stock remains available for repurchase. Shares repurchased by the Company are accounted for when the transaction is settled. As of September 30, 2024, there were no unsettled share repurchases.

reportable segments: Services, Insurance-as-a-Service, and Hippo Home Insurance Program. 
 The Company s Services segment earns fees and/or commission income without assuming underwriting risk or need for reinsurance. The Company also partners with home builders, as well as independent agencies, to source insureds seeking a product for which the Company provides the best carrier for the insured, whether it be of Hippo or a third-party carrier, including other insurance products like auto, rental, etc. 
 Insurance-as-a-Service is managed through the Company s subsidiary Spinnaker and is a platform to support third party MGAs. The Company rents its capital, state licenses and the strong financial rating of Spinnaker (rated A- Excellent by A.M. Best) to earn fee-based revenues with the assumption of limited underwriting risk using quota-share reinsurance. The Company also earns a portion of the premiums paid to it for the risk the Company retains as well as generates investment income. The diversification of the Company s balance sheet allows it to carry less capital than the Company s MGA clients would be required to on their own. 
 The Hippo Home Insurance Program is the Company s Hippo-branded homeowners insurance business. The Company s main source of revenue is the premiums paid to it by the Company s homeowner customers. In addition, the Company s revenues include commissions for premiums the Company cedes to third parties, policy and services fees and investment income. The Company s strategy is to retain the portion of the underwriting risk where the Company believes its loss prevention strategies are the most effective. 
 The Company s Chief Executive Officer, who serves as the chief operating decision maker CODM ), evaluates the financial performance of the Company s segments based upon segment adjusted operating income or

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to we, our, Hippo and the Company refer to the business and operations of Hippo Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Overview 
 Hippo is an insurance holding company with subsidiaries that provide property and casualty insurance products to both individuals and business customers. We conduct our operations through three reportable segments: Services, Insurance-as-a-Service, and Hippo Home Insurance Program. We offer our services primarily in the United States. 
 In the third quarter of 2023 we began taking several actions to lower the volatility of our Hippo Homeowners Insurance Program portfolio in light of the significant catastrophe losses we experienced in the second quarter of 2023, including raising rates on a portion of our renewal business, increasing deductibles for wind and hail perils, selectively non-renewing policies in certain regions, and instituting a nationwide pause on underwriting new premiums for our HO3 business as we examined our risk appetite. We also launched an expense reduction initiative across the Company, including a reduction in staff which we announced in October 2023. 
 Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Reinsurance 
 We utilize reinsurance primarily to support the growth of our new and renewal insurance business, to reduce the volatility of our earnings, and to optimize our capital management. 
 As an MGA, we underwrite homeowners insurance policies on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries (Spinnaker and Spinnaker Specialty Insurance Company SSIC )) and other non-affiliated third-party insurance carriers. These carriers purchase reinsurance from a variety of sources and in a variety of structures. In the basic form of this arrangement, fronting insurance carriers will typically cede a significant portion of the total insurance premium they earn from customers, in return for a proportional amount of reinsurance protection. This is known as ceding premium and losses through a quota share or proportional reinsurance treaty. 
 The insurance carrier and the MGA are paid a percentage of the ceded premium as compensation for sales and marketing, underwriting, insurance, support, claims administration, and other related services (in totality, known as a ceding commission). As additional protection against natural catastrophes or other large loss events, the fronting carrier frequently purchases additional, non-proportional reinsurance. 
 Without reinsurance protection, the insurer would shoulder all of the insurance risk itself and would need incremental capital to satisfy regulators and rating agencies requirements. Reinsurance allows a carrier to write more business while reducing its balance sheet exposure and volatility of earnings. 
 Proportional Reinsurance Treaties Hippo Home Insurance Program 
 For our Hippo primary homeowners reinsurance program for policies with effective dates in 2024, we elected not to purchase proportional reinsurance. Based on our growing confidence in the profitability and predictability of our underwriting results, we decided to retain more of the exposure and associated premium. 
 For business produced through our builder channel for policies with effective dates in 2024, we purchased proportional reinsurance from one third-party reinsurer and expect to retain approximately 85 of the premium and associated risk, before purchasing catastrophe protection. All reinsurance obligations are appropriately 
 29 

collateralized. The reinsurance contracts are subject to contingent commission adjustments and a loss occurrence limit, which aligns our interests with that of the reinsurer. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, we also elected to cut off 25 of the reinsurer s participation on the 2023 proportional reinsurance treaty and retain the remaining exposure and related premiums. 
 In 2024, we continue to further protect our balance sheet through the purchase of non-proportional reinsurance described below in the section titled Non-Proportional Reinsurance. 
 For our primary homeowners reinsurance program for policies with effective dates in 2023, we secured proportional reinsurance from a diverse panel of third-party reinsurers. All reinsurers are either rated A- Excellent or better by AM Best, or the reinsurance is appropriately collateralized. In 2023, we retained approximately 40 of the premium through our insurance company subsidiaries or our captive reinsurance company, RHS, before purchasing catastrophe protection. Additionally, the reinsurance contracts are subject to contingent commission adjustments and loss participation features, which align our interests with those of our reinsurers. Loss participation features may increase the amount of losses retained by our insurance company subsidiaries in excess of our pro rata participation. 
 For business produced through our builder channel for policies with effective dates in 2023, we purchased proportional reinsurance from three third-party reinsurers. All reinsurers are rated A- Excellent or better by AM Best, or the reinsurance is appropriately collateralized. In 2023, we retained approximately 58 of the premium produced through our insurance company subsidiaries or RHS, before purchasing catastrophe protection. The reinsurance contract is subject to contingent commission adjustments and limited loss participation features, which align our interests with those of the reinsurers. 
 For our primary homeowners reinsurance program for policies with effective dates in 2022, we secured quota share reinsurance from a diverse panel of third-party reinsurers. All reinsurers are either rated A- Excellent or better by AM Best, or the reinsurance is collateralized. In 2022, we retained approximately 10 of the premium through our insurance company subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurance company, RHS. Additionally, the reinsurance contracts are subject to variable commission adjustments and loss participation features, including loss ratio caps and loss corridors, which align our interests with those of our reinsurers. Similar to the prior year, we saw increased use of loss participation features in the 2022 reinsurance agreements, which increased the amount of losses retained by our insurance company subsidiaries in excess of our pro rata participation in both the 2022 and 2023 fiscal periods. 
 Non-Proportional Reinsurance Hippo Home Insurance Program 
 We also purchased non-proportional excess of loss catastrophe coverage XOL reinsurance which includes traditional reinsurance protection, state subsidized reinsurance protection, catastrophe bonds, and industry loss warranty products. Through our insurance company subsidiaries, we are exposed to the risk of natural catastrophe events that could occur on the risks arising from policies underwritten by us or other MGAs. We are also exposed to this risk through our captive reinsurer, which takes on a share of the risk underwritten by our MGA business. 
 In May 2023, we secured new catastrophe protection through a per occurrence XOL reinsurance agreement with Mountain Re Ltd. Mountain Re ), an independent Bermuda company, licensed as a Special Purpose Insurer. The reinsurance agreement meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance contracts. In connection with the reinsurance agreement, Mountain Re issued notes (generally referred to as catastrophe bonds to investors, consistent with the amount of coverage provided under the reinsurance agreement. The reinsurance agreement provides us with coverage through June 2026, and pursuant to the agreement, Mountain Re provides XOL reinsurance coverage to us for losses from a variety of perils, including named storms, fire following an earthquake, severe thunderstorms, and winter storms on business produced through the Hippo MGA. Under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, we are obligated to pay annual reinsurance premiums to Mountain Re for the reinsurance coverage which inures to the benefit of our traditional 
 30 

XOL program described below. Amounts payable under the reinsurance agreement with respect to any covered event cannot exceed our actual losses from such event. 
 Our XOL program provides us protection from catastrophes that could impact a large number of insurance policies. We buy XOL so that the probability of losses from a single occurrence exceeding the protection purchased is no more than 0.4 , or equivalent to a 1 in 250-year return period when considered with the Mountain Re per occurrence, described above, corporate catastrophe, and Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the FHCF XOL described below under Other Reinsurance. This reinsurance protects us from all but the most severe catastrophic events. 
 Other Reinsurance 
 Spinnaker also purchased reinsurance for programs written by MGAs other than Hippo through our Insurance-as-a-Service business. The reinsurance treaties are a mix of proportional and XOL in which generally 75 to 100 of the risk, up to at least the 1 in 250-year return period, is ceded. The reinsurance contracts are subject to variable commission adjustments and loss participation features, including loss caps, which may increase the amount of losses retained by us in excess of our pro-rata participation. Such provisions are recognized in the period based on the experience to date under the agreement. 
 Spinnaker purchased a corporate catastrophe XOL program that attaches above the individual programmatic reinsurance programs protecting the property business written by Hippo as well as the other MGAs. This treaty has a floating retention and attaches at the exhaustion point of the underlying programs specific reinsurance. The catastrophe bond, and the FHCFs, described above, inures to the benefit of this contract. This program provides us protection from catastrophes that could impact a large number of correlated insurance policies underwritten by us and our other MGAs. We buy this XOL so that the probability of losses from a single occurrence across the property portfolio exceeding the protection purchased is no more than 0.4 , or equivalent to a 1 in 250 year-return period. This reinsurance protects us from all but the most severe catastrophic events. 
 We purchased reinsurance from the State Board of Administration in Florida via the FHCF annually for admitted residential hurricane losses in the State of Florida. This coverage is provided by the State of Florida and protects business written by Hippo as well as other MGAs that produce admitted residential policies. We currently purchase reimbursement protection at the maximum level (90 of mandatory coverage offered by the FHCF. 
 
 Key Factors and Trends Affecting our Operating Results 
 Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: 
 Our Ability to Attract New Customers 
 Our long-term growth will depend, in large part, on our continued ability to attract new customers to our platform. For Hippo home insurance policies, we seek to minimize the volatility of our portfolio and are currently in the process of analyzing overall underwriting results for the segment, taking actions as needed. Our short-term focus is on attracting new customers to our licensed insurance agency to purchase non-Hippo policies and to our home care offerings, although over time we expect to strategically return to Hippo underwritten policies as our underwriting actions take hold. We intend to continue to drive new customer growth by highlighting our consumer-focused approach to home protection and insurance across multiple distribution channels, regardless of whether the customer is a Hippo policyholder. In particular, we seek to grow by: 
 Promoting our agency for sales of non-Hippo policies, growing our network of partners within existing partner channels, and geographically optimizing our Hippo policyholder base; 
 Developing new strategic partnerships with key players involved in the real estate transaction ecosystem; and 
 Deepening our relationships with our customers by connecting them to partners offering value-added services that are not specifically insurance products, such as home maintenance, home monitoring, and energy consumption optimization. 
 31 

Our ability to attract new customers depends on the pricing of our products, the offerings of our competitors, our geographic reach, and the extent and effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Our ability to attract customers also depends on maintaining and strengthening our brand by providing superior customer experiences across all of our offerings through our proactive, tech-enabled strategy. 
 We face competition from traditional insurers who have more diverse product offerings and longer established operating histories, as well as from new, technology-driven entrants who may pursue more horizontal growth strategies. These competitors may mimic certain aspects of our digital platform and offerings and have more types of insurance products, allowing them to offer customers the ability to bundle multiple coverage types together, which may be attractive to many customers. 
 Our Ability to Retain Customers 
 Our ability to derive significant lifetime value from our customer relationships depends, in part, on our ability to retain our customers over time. Strong retention allows us to build a recurring revenue base, generating additional premium term over term without material incremental marketing costs. Our customers typically become more valuable to us over time because retention rates have historically increased with the age of customer cohorts and because non-catastrophic loss frequency declines as cohorts mature. 
 As we expect to broadly retain our customers who are not located in high severe weather exposed regions, over the long-term, we expect our book of business to evolve to be weighted more towards renewals versus new business, as is the case with our more mature competitors. We expect that this would enable us to benefit from the higher premium retention rates and inherently lower frequency of losses that characterize renewed premiums. 
 Our ability to retain customers will depend on a number of factors, including our customers satisfaction with our products, the offerings of our competitors, and our ability to continue delivering exceptional customer service and support. 
 Our Ability to Manage Regulatory Impact, Including on Our Efforts to Manage Our Exposure to Volatility 
 We are subject to extensive laws, regulations, administrative directives, and regulatory actions. From time to time, regulatory authorities or legislative bodies seek to influence and restrict premium rates, require premium refunds to policyholders, require reinstatement of terminated policies, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew policies, require insurers to continue to write new policies or limit their ability to write new policies, limit insurers ability to change coverage terms and deductibles or to impose underwriting standards, impose additional regulations regarding agency and broker compensation, impose fines and penalties for unintended errors or mistakes, impose additional regulations regarding cybersecurity and privacy, and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. These laws may limit or restrict our ability to reduce our exposures, including to weather related losses. 
 Our Ability to Expand Fee Income and Premium Through Cross-Sales to Existing Customers 
 One of our strategies to increase the value we are providing to our customers is to offer incremental services to assist our customers in better maintaining and protecting their homes. As we roll out these services, we expect to be able to generate incremental, non-risk-based service and fee income from our existing customers. We expect these home protection services not only to generate incremental revenue, but also to reduce losses for our customers, and by implication our loss ratios. Our success in expanding revenue and reducing losses by offering these services depends on our ability to market these services, our operational ability to deliver value to our customers, and the ability of these services to reduce the probability of loss for an average homeowner. 
 We are also in the early stages of cross-selling non-homeowner insurance products across our customer base. Cross-sales allow us to generate additional premium per customer, and ultimately higher revenue and fee income, without material incremental marketing spend. Our success in expanding revenue through cross-sales depends on our marketing efforts with new products, offerings of our competitors, additional expansion into new states, and the pricing of our bundled products. 
 Our Ability to Manage Risk 
 We leverage data, technology, and geographic diversity to help manage risk. For instance, we obtain dynamic data from various sources and use advanced statistical methods to model that data into our pricing 
 32 

algorithm. Incorporating these external data sources and utilizing the experience gained with our own customer base should lead to better underwriting, reduced loss frequency, and adjusting for weather related events lower loss ratios over time. While our current reinsurance framework helps us manage the volatility of earnings, reducing our overall gross loss ratio is critical to our success. Our ability to incorporate new data sources as they become available and to use them to improve our ability to accurately and competitively price risk is central to our growth strategy. 
 Seasonality of Claims Losses 
 Seasonal patterns can impact our incurrence of claims losses, as seasonal weather patterns impact the level and amount of claims we receive. These patterns include hurricanes, wildfires, and coastal storms in the fall, cold weather patterns and changing home heating needs in the winter, and tornados and hailstorms in the spring and summer. The mix of geographic exposure and products within our customer base impacts our exposure to these weather patterns, and as we diversify our base of premium such that our exposure more closely resembles the industry exposure, we should see the impact of these events on our business more closely resemble the impact on the broader industry. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Gross Written Premium 
 Gross written premium is the amount received or to be received for insurance policies written or assumed by us and our affiliates as a carrier or captive reinsurer, without reduction for policy acquisition costs, reinsurance costs, or other deductions. The volume of our gross written premium in any given period is generally influenced by: 
 New business submissions; 
 Binding of new business submissions into policies; 
 Bound policies going effective; 
 Renewals of existing policies; and 
 Average size and premium rate of bound policies. 
 Ceded Written Premium 
 Ceded written premium is the amount of gross written premium written or assumed by us and our affiliates as a carrier that we cede to reinsurers. We enter into reinsurance contracts to limit our exposure to losses, as well as to provide additional capacity for growth. Ceded written premium is treated as a reduction from gross written premium. The volume of our ceded written premium is impacted by the level of our gross written premium and decisions we make to increase or decrease retention levels. 
 
 Net Earned Premium 
 Net earned premium represents the earned portion of our gross written premium for insurance policies written or assumed by us and less the earned portion of ceded written premium (any portion of our gross written premium that is ceded to third-party reinsurers under our reinsurance agreements). We earn written premiums on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies. 
 Commission Income, Net Includes: 
 a. MGA Commission: We operate as an MGA for multiple insurers. We design and underwrite insurance products on behalf of the insurers culminating in the sale of insurance policies. We earn recurring commission and policy fees associated with the policies we sell. We have underwriting authority and responsibility for administering claims (see Claim Processing Fees below) and we work with affiliated and unaffiliated carrier platforms who pay us a commission in exchange for the opportunity to take that risk on their balance sheets. Our performance obligation associated with these contracts is the placement of the policy, which is met on the effective date. Upon issuance of a new policy, we charge policy fees and inspection fees (see Service and Fee Income below), retain our share of commission, and remit the balance 
 33 

to the respective insurers. Subsequent commission adjustments arising from policy changes such as endorsements are recognized in the period when the adjustments occur. Cash received in advance of policy effective dates is recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, representing our portion of commission and premium due to insurers and reinsurers, and held in trust for the benefit of the insurers and reinsurers as fiduciary liabilities. 
 The MGA commission is subject to adjustments, higher or lower (commonly referred to as commission slide ), depending on the underwriting performance of the policies placed by us. We are required to return a portion of our MGA commission due to commission slide on the policies placed as an MGA if the underwriting performance varies due to higher Hippo programs loss ratio from provisional performance of the Hippo programs loss ratio. We also return a portion of our MGA commission if the policies are cancelled before the term of the policy. Accordingly, we reserve for commission slide using estimated Hippo programs loss ratio performance, or a cancellation reserve as a reduction of revenue for each period presented in our statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 b. Agency Commission: We also operate licensed insurance agencies that are engaged solely in the sale of policies, including non-Hippo policies. For these policies, we earn a recurring agency commission from the carriers whose policies we sell, which is recorded in the commission income, net line on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Similar to the MGA businesses, the performance obligation from the agency contracts is placement of the insurance policies. 
 For both MGA and insurance agency activities, we recognize commission received from insurers for the sale of insurance contracts as revenue at a point in time on the policy effective dates. 
 c. Ceding Commission: We receive commission based on the premium we cede to third-party reinsurers for the reimbursement for our acquisition and underwriting services. Excess ceding commission over the cost of acquisition is included in the commission income, net line on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the policies that we write on our own carrier as MGA, we recognize this commission as ceding commission on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. We earn commission on reinsurance premium ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. We record the portion of ceding commission income, which represents reimbursement of successful direct acquisition costs related to the underlying policies, as an offset to the applicable direct acquisition costs. 
 d. Carrier Fronting Fees: Through our Insurance-as-a-Service business, we earn fronting fees from the MGA programs we support. We earn fronting fees in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. This revenue is included in the commission income, net line on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 e. Claim Processing Fees: As an MGA, we receive a fee that is calculated as a percent of the premium from the insurers in exchange for providing claims adjudication services. The claims adjudication services are provided over the term of the policy and recognized ratably over the same period. This revenue is included in the commission income, net line on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Service and Fee Income 
 Service and fee income mainly represents policy fees and other revenue. We directly bill policyholders for policy fees and collect and retain fees per the terms of the contracts between us and our insurers. Similar to the commission revenue, we estimate a cancellation reserve for policy fees using historical information. The performance obligation associated with these fees is satisfied at a point in time upon completion of the underwriting process, which is the policy effective date. Accordingly, we recognize all fees as revenue on the policy effective date. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income represents interest earned from fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and other investments, and the gains or losses from the sale of investments. Our cash and invested assets primarily consist of fixed-maturity securities, and may also include cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, and short-term 
 34 

investments. The principal factors that influence net investment income are the size of our investment portfolio and the yield on that portfolio. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair value, such as changes in interest rates), the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of our invested equity capital along with premium we receive from our customers less payments on customer claims. 
 Net investment income also includes an insignificant amount of net realized gains (losses) on investments, which are a function of the difference between the amount received by us on the sale of a security and the security s amortized cost, as well as any allowances for credit losses recognized in earnings, if any. 
 Expenses 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 Loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the costs incurred for losses net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. We enter into reinsurance contracts to limit our exposure to potential losses as well as to provide additional capacity for growth. The expenses are a function of the size and term of the insurance policies and the loss experience and loss participation features associated with the underlying risks. Loss and LAE are based on actuarial assumptions and management judgements, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. Loss and LAE also include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation and benefits) of our claims processing teams, as well as allocated occupancy costs and related overhead based on headcount. 
 Insurance-Related Expenses 
 Insurance related expenses primarily consist of amortization of direct acquisition commission costs and premium taxes incurred on the successful acquisition of business written on a direct basis and credit card processing fees not charged to our customers. Insurance related expenses also include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation and benefits) of our underwriting teams, amortization of capitalized internal use software, as well as allocated occupancy costs and related overhead based on headcount. Insurance related expenses are offset by a portion of ceding commission income, which represents reimbursement of successful acquisition costs related to the underlying policies. Additionally, insurance related expenses include the costs of providing bound policies and delivering claims services to our customers. These costs include underwriting technology service costs including software, data services used for performing underwriting, and third-party call center costs in addition to personnel-related costs. 
 Technology and Development 
 Technology and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation and benefits) for our technology staff, which includes technology development, infrastructure support, actuarial, and third-party services. Technology and development also include allocated facility costs and related overhead based on headcount. We expense development costs as incurred, except for costs related to internal use software development projects, which are capitalized and subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the developed software. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of sales commission, advertising costs, and marketing expenditures, as well as employee compensation (including stock-based compensation and benefits) for employees engaged in sales, marketing, data analytics, and customer acquisition. Sales and marketing expenses also include allocated facility costs and related overhead based on headcount. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation and benefits) for our finance, human resources, legal, and general management functions, as well as facilities, insurance, and professional services. 
 Impairment and Restructuring Charges 
 Impairment and restructuring charges consist of non-cash impairment charges relating to goodwill. We review goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
 35 

indicate that an impairment may exist. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is calculated and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. It also consists of severance and other personnel costs associated with exit and disposal activities as well as reductions in workforce. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 Other (income) expense, net primarily consists of certain fair value adjustments and other non-operating income expenses. 
 Income Taxes 
 We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. We measure these differences using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets and liabilities to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations, and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. 
 
 Key Operating and Financial Metrics and Non-GAAP Measures 
 We regularly review the following key operating and financial metrics in order to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures below have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, or cash flows generated by operating, investing, and financing activities, as there may be significant factors or trends that it fails to address. We caution investors that non-GAAP financial information by its nature departs from traditional accounting conventions. Therefore, its use can make it difficult to compare our current results with our results from other reporting periods and with the results of other companies. 
 Our management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, as an integral part of managing our business and to, among other things: (i) monitor and evaluate the performance of our business operations and financial performance; (ii) facilitate internal comparisons of the historical operating performance of our business operations; (iii) review and assess the operating performance of our management team; (iv) analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments; and (v) plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments.

Total Generated Premium 
 We define Total Generated Premium as the aggregate written premium placed across all of our business platforms for the period presented. We measure Total Generated Premium as it reflects the volume of our business irrespective of choices related to how we structure our reinsurance treaties, the amount of risk we retain on our own balance sheet, or the amount of business written in our capacity as an MGA, agency, or as an insurance carrier/reinsurer. We calculate Total Generated Premium as the sum of: 
 i) Gross written premium GWP a GAAP measure defined above; and 
 ii) Gross placed premium premium of policies placed with third-party insurance companies, for which we do not retain insurance risk and for which we earn a commission payment, and policy fees charged by us to the policyholders on the effective date of the policy.

 Our Total Generated Premium for the three months ended September 30, 2024 grew 21 year-over-year to 368.0 million from 303.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The growth was driven primarily by the growth in the total book of business in our aggregator channel, as well as in our builder channel for new and renewal business, as we maintain higher retention rates and experienced premium rate increases. The growth was also due to the growth of non-Hippo written premium supported by our Insurance-as-a-Service business. This was partially offset by a decrease in our Hippo Home Insurance Program HHIP as we have taken actions to reduce our exposure to wind and hail while achieving planned premium rate increases. 
 Our Total Generated Premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 grew 20 year-over-year to 1,041.6 million from 866.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The growth was driven primarily by the growth in the total book of business in our aggregator channel, as well as in our builder channel for new and renewal business, as we maintain higher retention rates and experienced premium rate increases. The growth was also due to the growth of non-Hippo written premium supported by our Insurance-as-a-Service business. This was partially offset by a decrease in our HHIP as we have taken actions to reduce our exposure to wind and hail while achieving planned premium rate increases. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization adjusted EBITDA ), a Non-GAAP financial measure, as net loss attributable to Hippo excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, net investment income, restructuring charges, impairment expense, gains and losses on sales of business, and other non-cash fair market value adjustments including contingent consideration for one of our acquisitions, and other transactions, which may include certain legal fees and settlement costs, that we consider to be unique in nature. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDA loss was 7.5 million, a decrease of 30.9 million compared to a 38.4 million EBITDA loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a growth in revenue reflecting an increase in premiums earned mainly due to higher premium retention as a result of the 2023 and 2024 reinsurance treaty compared to prior periods, and a lower HHIP 
 37 

gross loss ratio due primarily to the benefits of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken, including a reduction of loss participation features in our reinsurance treaties, and a decrease in other operating expenses. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDA loss was 52.2 million, a decrease of 126.1 million compared to a 178.3 million EBITDA loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a growth in revenue reflecting an increase in premiums earned mainly due to higher premium retention as a result of the 2023 and 2024 reinsurance treaty compared to prior periods, a lower HHIP gross loss ratio due primarily to the benefits of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken, including a reduction of loss participation features in our reinsurance treaties, and a decrease in other operating expenses.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Gross Loss Ratio was 50 net of a prior year favorable development of 6 percentage points relating to non-PCS events and 2 percentage points relating to PCS events compared with 59 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease reflected the benefits of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken and due to a lower impact from non-PCS events which was partially offset by an increase in PCS losses primarily due to an increase in the severity of PCS events. We expect continued improvement as these actions have more time to impact our financial results. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Gross Loss Ratio was 55 net of a prior year favorable development of 2 percentage points relating to non-PCS events and 2 percentage points relating to PCS events compared with 81 net of a prior year favorable development of 2 percentage points relating to non-PCS events and 1 percentage point relating to PCS events for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Services 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Services segment, which earns fees and/or commission income without assuming underwriting risk or need for reinsurance, had Total Generated Premium of 177.9 million, an increase of 46 from 121.6 million over the prior year quarter, while revenue was 13.2 million, an increase of 14 from 11.6 million over the prior year quarter. The growth was driven primarily due to the growth in the total book of business in our aggregator channel, as well as in our builder channel for new and renewal business, as we maintain higher retention rates and experienced premium rate increases. Our adjusted operating loss was 3.4 million, a decrease of 65 compared to a loss of 9.7 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower adjusted operating expenses including a decrease in advertising costs, and an increase in revenue as noted above. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Services segment, which earns fees and/or commission income without assuming underwriting risk or need for reinsurance, had Total Generated Premium of 474.9 million, an increase of 41 from 337.6 million over the prior year period, while revenue was 36.7 million, an increase of 12 from 32.8 million over the prior year period. The growth was driven primarily due to the growth in the total book of business in our aggregator channel, as well as in our builder channel for new and renewal business, as we maintain higher retention rates and experienced premium rate increases. Our adjusted operating loss was 13.2 million, a decrease of 56 compared to a loss of 30.3 million in the prior year period, due primarily to lower adjusted operating expenses including a decrease in advertising costs, and an increase in revenue as noted above. 
 
 Insurance-as-a-Service 
 Our Insurance-as-a-Service segment, which through our carrier, Spinnaker, leverages our capital and insurance licenses to provide capacity to third party MGAs, creating diversified income through fees, underwriting 
 41 

profits, and investment income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Total Generated Premium was 159.3 million, an increase of 12 from 141.8 million over the prior year quarter, while revenue was 25.4 million, an increase of 31 from 19.4 million over the prior year quarter. The growth was driven primarily by the increase in performance of existing programs. Adjusted operating income was 6.7 million, an increase of 86 compared to income of 3.6 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the increase in revenue mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in insurance related expenses and loss and loss adjustment expenses due to the growth of the book of business. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Total Generated Premium was 475.6 million, an increase of 20 from 397.5 million over the prior year period, while revenue was 70.2 million, an increase of 44 from 48.6 million over the prior year period. The growth was driven primarily by the increase in performance of existing programs. Adjusted operating income was 17.1 million, an increase of 49 compared to income of 11.5 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the increase in revenue mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in insurance related expenses and loss and loss adjustment expenses due to the growth of the book of business. 
 
 Hippo Home Insurance Program 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Hippo Homeowners Insurance Program had Total Generated Premium of 77.6 million, a decrease of 18 from 95.0 million over the prior year quarter, while revenue was 61.1 million, an increase of 111 from 28.9 million over the prior year quarter. The increase in revenue was due primarily to higher net earned premium due to higher retention on our 2023 and 2024 reinsurance treaties. We purchased XOL to cover events in excess of per occurrence limits based on the expected growth in exposure during the year which results in an increase in ceded earned premium and lower net earned premium. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 5.8 million and 7.4 million, respectively, was offset against earned premium for XOL. Adjusted operating loss was 9.9 million in the quarter, a decrease of 69 compared to a loss of 31.7 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in adjusted operating loss was due primarily to the increase in revenue noted above and an improvement in our net loss ratio due to improved terms on our reinsurance treaties and a lower impact of non-PCS events, and lower adjusted operating expenses. This was partially offset by an increase in insurance related expenses due to higher premium retention. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Hippo Homeowners Insurance Program had Total Generated Premium of 217.2 million, a decrease of 25 from 289.4 million over the prior year period, while revenue was 172.4 million, an increase of 143 from 71.0 million over the prior year quarter. The increase in revenue was due primarily to higher net earned premium due to higher retention on our 2023 and 2024 reinsurance treaties, partially offset by a decrease in commission income, net, reflecting changes in our 2023 and 2024 reinsurance treaties, resulting in higher premium retention, and achieving planned premium rate increases. We purchased XOL to cover events in excess of per occurrence limits based on the expected growth in exposure during the year which results in an increase in ceded earned premium and lower net earned premium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 20.7 million and 23.3 million, respectively, was offset against earned premium for XOL. Adjusted operating loss was 56.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of 64 compared to a loss of 157.9 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in adjusted operating loss was due primarily to the increase in revenue noted above, a decrease in adjusted operating expenses, partially due to a reduction in headcount and decrease in sales commissions, as well as an improvement in our net loss ratio due to improved terms on our reinsurance treaties and a lower impact of PCS events. This was partially offset by an increase in insurance related expenses due to higher premium retention. 
 
 Hippo Home Insurance Program Gross Loss Ratio 
 Hippo Home Insurance Program Gross Loss Ratio HPGLR is a key performance indicator that represents our underwriting operational performance for the entire Total Generated Premium underwritten by Hippo as part of the Hippo Home Insurance Program. This ratio includes losses and premiums written and placed on Spinnaker (our carrier) as well as other carriers for Hippo policies (policies underwritten by the Hippo MGA). For the periods presented, changes in this ratio also impact our ceding commission revenue and loss participation features in our reinsurance treaties, which is included in loss and loss adjustment expense on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. This ratio is also used by our reinsurers and other 
 42 

carriers to make business decisions relating to the capacity of reinsurance and amount of ceding commission that would be available to Hippo. The lower the ratio, the better the economics for Hippo.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, HPGLR was 72 net of a prior year favorable development of 2 percentage points relating to non-PCS events and 1 percentage point relating to PCS events compared to 75 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the non-PCS losses reflected the benefits of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken, which was partially offset by an increase in PCS losses primarily due to an increase in the severity of PCS events. We expect continued improvement as these actions have more time to impact our financial results. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, HPGLR was 79 net of a prior year favorable development of 1 percentage point relating to non-PCS events and 5 percentage points relating to PCS events compared to 118 net of a prior year favorable development of 2 percentage points relating to non-PCS events and 1 percentage point relating to PCS events for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease reflected the benefits of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken and a lower impact from PCS events. We expect continued improvement as these actions have more time to impact our financial results.

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net Earned Premium 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net earned premium was 70.6 million, an increase of 37.7 million compared to 32.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due primarily to increases in gross earned premium due to year-over-year growth of our total book of business and higher retention of earned premium due to our 2023 and 2024 reinsurance treaties, partially offset by an increased cost of XOL premiums for our catastrophic coverage which results in an increase in ceded earned premium and lower net earned premium. We purchased XOL to cover events in excess of per occurrence limits based on the expected growth in exposure during the year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 15.4 million and 14.3 million, respectively, was offset against earned premium for XOL. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net earned premium was 195.5 million, an increase of 126.5 million compared to 69.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due primarily to increases in gross earned premium due to year-over-year growth of our total book of business and higher retention of earned premium due to our 2023 and 2024 reinsurance treaties, partially offset by an increased cost of XOL premiums for our catastrophic coverage which results in an increase in ceded earned premium and lower net earned premium. We purchased XOL to cover events in excess of per occurrence limits based on the expected growth in exposure during the year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 44.3 million and 39.9 million, respectively, was offset against earned premium for XOL. 
 The following table presents gross written premium, ceded written premium, net written premium, change in unearned premium, and net earned premium for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions). 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Gross written premium 234.4 229.5 4.9 686.8 663.6 23.2 Ceded written premium (143.8) (178.0) 34.2 (393.4) (559.8) 166.4 Net written premium 90.6 51.5 39.1 293.4 103.8 189.6 Change in unearned premium (20.0) (18.6) (1.4) (97.9) (34.8) (63.1) Net earned premium 70.6 32.9 37.7 195.5 69.0 126.5 
 Commission Income, Net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, commission income was 15.7 million, an increase of 1.5 million, or 11 , compared to 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in agency commissions of 2.3 million and carrier fronting fees of 0.5 million, both of which grew due to the year-over-year growth of our total book of business. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in ceding commissions of 0.8 million due to higher premium retention, which decreases ceding commissions and increases net earned premium. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commission income was 47.7 million, a decrease of 0.1 million, or 0 , compared to 47.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in ceding commissions of 11.4 million due to higher premium retention, which decreases ceding commissions and increases net earned premium, and a decrease in MGA commissions of 0.3 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in agency commissions of 8.4 million and carrier fronting fees of 3.2 million, both of which grew due to the year-over-year growth of our total book of business. 

45 

Service and Fee Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, service and fee income was 3.0 million, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 39 , compared to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in policy fees and fee sharing arrangements. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, service and fee income was 8.8 million, a decrease of 3.1 million, or 16 , compared to 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in policy fees and fee sharing arrangements. 
 Net Investment Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 6.2 million, an increase of 0.5 million, compared to 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in yields and diversification. We are mainly invested in money market accounts, securities issued by the U.S. government and agencies, high-grade corporate securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other governmental related securities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 18.2 million, an increase of 1.7 million, compared to 16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in yields and diversification. We are mainly invested in money market accounts, securities issued by the U.S. government and agencies, high-grade corporate securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other governmental related securities. 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, loss and loss adjustment expenses were 51.6 million, an increase of 15.1 million, compared to 36.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in losses due to higher premium retention rates and the growth of our book of business, which is partially offset by an improvement in our net loss ratio due to improved terms on our reinsurance treaties, and pricing and underwriting actions we have taken. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss and loss adjustment expenses were 164.6 million, an increase of 13.7 million, compared to 150.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in losses due to higher premium retention rates and the growth of our book of business which is partially offset by an improvement in our net loss ratio due to improved terms on our reinsurance treaties, and pricing and underwriting actions we have taken. 
 Insurance Related Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, insurance related expenses were 22.6 million, an increase of 2.3 million, or 11 , compared to 20.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs of 4.4 million due to higher premium retention rates and the growth of our book of business, and an increase in amortization expense attributable to capitalized internal use software of 0.9 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in underwriting and other insurance related expenses. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, insurance related expenses were 67.9 million, an increase of 13.1 million, or 24 , compared to 54.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs of 15.6 million due to higher premium retention rates and the growth of our book of business, and an increase in amortization expense attributable 
 46 

to capitalized internal use software of 2.9 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in underwriting and other insurance related expenses. 
 The primary components of insurance related expenses are listed below (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, net 11.7 7.3 35.8 20.2 Employee-related costs 3.2 3.0 8.9 9.4 Underwriting costs 1.5 2.5 4.4 6.5 Amortization of capitalized internal use software 4.3 3.4 12.3 9.4 Other 1.9 4.1 6.5 9.3 Total 22.6 20.3 67.9 54.8 
 Direct acquisition costs were 20.5 million and 65.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 8.8 million and 29.6 million were offset by ceding commission income. 
 Direct acquisition costs were 24.3 million and 60.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which 17.0 million and 40.1 million were offset by ceding commission income. 
 Technology and Development Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, technology and development expenses were 7.0 million, a decrease of 4.9 million, or 41 , compared to 11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in employee-related costs of 5.5 million, including a decrease in stock-based compensation of 1.9 million, driven by a decrease in headcount. This decrease is partially offset by a decrease of 1.6 million in capitalized employee-related costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, technology and development expenses were 23.1 million, a decrease of 13.5 million, or 37 , compared to 36.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in employee-related costs of 14.2 million, including a decrease in stock-based compensation of 5.7 million, driven by a decrease in headcount. This decrease is partially offset by a decrease of 3.3 million in capitalized employee-related costs. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses were 12.5 million, a decrease of 6.4 million, or 34 , compared to 18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in employee-related costs of 3.3 million, including a decrease in stock-based compensation of 1.6 million due to a decrease in headcount, and a decrease in advertising costs of 1.3 million. The decrease was also due to a decrease in commission expense of 0.7 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses were 40.3 million, a decrease of 23.6 million, or 37 , compared to 63.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in employee-related costs of 9.1 million, including a decrease stock-based compensation of 4.9 million due to a decrease in headcount, and a decrease in advertising costs of 6.8 million. The decrease was also due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration of 2.0 million and decrease in commission expense of 2.0 million. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 15.3 million, a decrease of 5.4 million, or 26 , compared to 20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 
 47 

decrease was due primarily to a decrease in stock-based compensation of 2.2 million, legal costs of 1.2 million, and corporate insurance costs of 0.7 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 53.5 million, a decrease of 8.5 million, or 14 , compared to 62.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in stock-based compensation of 7.0 million, partially driven by a charge due to the repricing of options during the first quarter of 2023, and a decrease in corporate insurance of 2.3 million. This was partially offset by an increase in legal costs of 1.7 million. 
 Impairment and Restructuring Charges 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no impairment or restructuring charges. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, impairment and restructuring charges were 3.6 million which primarily related to the impairment of a lease right-of-use asset due to abandonment of leased office space. There were no impairment and restructuring charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain on Sale of Business 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain on sale of 8.2 million related to our subsidiary, Mainsail. 
 There were no gain on sale of business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income was 0.1 million compared to 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income was 0.1 million compared to other expense of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other expense, net was due primarily to a decrease in our share of losses from equity method investees. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 0.0 million, an increase of 0.3 million compared to a benefit of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 1.0 million, an increase of 0.8 million compared to 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Hippo 
 Net loss attributable to Hippo is calculated in accordance with GAAP as total revenue less total expenses and taxes and net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to Hippo was 8.5 million, a decrease of 44.6 million compared to 53.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the factors described above. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to Hippo was 84.7 million, a decrease of 146.1 million compared to 230.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the factors described above. 
 48 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our existing sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 191.2 million of cash, 39.7 million of restricted cash, and 354.3 million of available-for-sale fixed income securities and short-term investments. 
 In addition, we are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of New York, which provides secured borrowing capacity. Our borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2024, is 11.5 million, and there were no outstanding amounts under this agreement. 
 To date, we have funded operations primarily with issuances of convertible preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, and from net proceeds from a private placement transaction in connection with the Business Combination, the Business Combination, and revenue. Until we can generate sufficient revenue and other income to cover operating expenses, working capital and capital expenditures, we expect the funds raised as discussed above to fund our cash needs. Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including the volume of issuances of insurance policies, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, investments in information technology systems, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. In the future, we may raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities or through borrowing. We cannot assure that such funds will be on favorable terms, or available at all . 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 53.9 (43.9) 97.8 Investing activities 2.5 79.6 (77.1) Financing activities (20.6) (10.8) (9.8) 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 53.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 97.8 million, from cash used in operating activities of 43.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in revenues as well as working capital changes that benefited cash due to higher premium retention and improved terms on our reinsurance treaties. Cash used in operating activities represents payments for our operations including, payroll, loss and loss adjusted expenses and marketing activities. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities was 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to the maturities of investment securities and proceeds from the sale of a business, partially offset by purchases of investment securities. 
 Cash provided by investing activities was 79.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the maturities and sales of investment securities, partially offset by purchases of investment securities and an office building. 
 49 

Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by distributions to noncontrolling interests and change in fiduciary liabilities, and taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by proceeds from common stock issuances. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by distributions to noncontrolling interests, repurchases of shares, and taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by proceeds from common stock issuances. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to purchase commitments, lease payments, and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense. There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than an increase in Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense. The estimation of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on various complex and subjective judgments. Actual losses paid may differ, perhaps significantly, from the reserve estimates reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Similarly, the timing of payment of our estimated losses is not fixed and there may be significant changes in actual payment activity. The assumptions used in estimating the likely payments due by period are based on our historical claims payment experience and industry payment patterns, but due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of such payments, there is a risk that the amounts paid can be significantly different from the amounts disclosed. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, loss and loss adjustment expense reserve, recoverability of our net deferred tax asset, and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates, or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 The information set forth under Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, we are provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting guidance either (1) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (2) within the same time periods as private companies. 
 We have elected to adopt new or revised accounting guidance within the same time period as private companies, unless management determines that it is preferable to take advantage of early adoption provisions offered within the applicable guidance. Our utilization of these transition periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the transition periods afforded under the JOBS Act. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 50 

We are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates. We are primarily exposed to market risk through our fixed maturities, short-term investments, and cash and cash equivalents. We invest our excess cash primarily in money market accounts, corporate and foreign securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other governmental related securities. Our current investment strategy seeks first to preserve principal, second to provide liquidity for our operating and capital needs, and third to maximize yield without putting principal at risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to the fluctuation of prevailing interest rates that may reduce the yield on our investments or their fair value. Management does not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, has concluded, based upon its evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The information set forth under Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption Legal Proceedings is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the following risk factor which supplements the risk factors referenced above. 
 We are subject to extensive insurance industry regulations. 
 Currently, Spinnaker is licensed to write limited lines of business in 50 states and the District of Columbia, and Hippo Analytics Inc. is licensed as an insurance agency in 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
 Each U.S. state regulator retains the authority to license insurance producers and insurance companies in their states, and a producer or company generally may not operate in a state in which it is not licensed. Accordingly, we are not permitted to sell or underwrite insurance to residents of the remaining states and territories of the United States for lines or products for which we are not authorized, which is likely to put us at a disadvantage among many of our competitors that have been in business much longer than us and are licensed to sell their insurance products in most, if not all, U.S. jurisdictions. 
 Additionally, RHS is domiciled in the Cayman Islands, and as such noncompliance with applicable Cayman regulations may subject us to regulatory action or private litigation. Further, applicable laws, regulations, and administrative practices in the Cayman Islands may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the states in which we transact business by the individual state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of consumers, and not necessarily the interests of insurers or producers, their shareholders, or other investors. Numerous aspects of our insurance business are subject to regulation, including, but not limited to, premium rates, mandatory covered risks, limitations on the ability to non-renew or to cancel or elect not to renew business, prohibited exclusions, licensing and appointment of agents, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of customers, investments and capital, policy forms and coverages, advertising and other conduct, including restrictions on the use of credit information and other factors in underwriting, as well as other production, underwriting and claims practices. To the extent we decide to expand our current product offerings to include other insurance products, this would subject us to additional regulatory requirements and scrutiny in each state in which we elect to offer such products. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance. Prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, misrepresentations, false advertising, coercion, disparaging other insurers, unfair claims settlement procedures, discrimination in the business of insurance, and offering illegal inducements in connection with insurance sales. Noncompliance with any of such state statutes may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and licensed agents and brokers. 
 Such laws, rules, and regulations are usually overseen and enforced by the various state insurance departments, as well as through private rights of action and by state attorneys general. Such regulations or enforcement actions are often responsive to current consumer and political sensitivities, such as homeowners insurance rates and coverage forms, which may arise after a major event. Such rules and regulations may result in rate suppression, limit our ability to manage our exposure to unprofitable or volatile risks, limit our ability to non-renew business, or lead to fines, premium refunds, or other adverse consequences. The federal government also may regulate aspects of our businesses, such as the protection of consumer confidential information or the use of consumer insurance (credit) scores to underwrite and assess the risk of customers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA ). Among other things, the FCRA requires insurance companies to have a permissible purpose before 
 52 

obtaining and using a consumer report for underwriting purposes, as well as comply with related notice and recordkeeping requirements. Failure to comply with federal requirements under the FCRA or any other applicable federal laws would subject us to regulatory fines and other sanctions. In addition, given our short operating history to-date and rapid speed of growth, we are particularly vulnerable to regulators identifying errors in the policy forms we use, the rates we charge, and our customer communications, including but not limited to cancellations, non-renewals, and reinstatements. For example, in March 2024 we received inquiries from the California Department of Insurance CDI related to the complaints they received from consumers specifically as regards the compliance with California law of the non-renewal of those homeowners policies. Although Hippo was able to resolve the California complaints and corresponding concerns of the CDI, if additional or future compliance issues arise, the CDI could impose fines as well as require remediation, refunds, or other penalties, which could be substantial. Regulatory actions or related civil actions by consumers could have a material financial impact on Hippo or its subsidiaries. Regulators also have the ability to issue cease-and-desist orders and take other civil actions to address compliance. 
 Our ability to retain state licenses depends on our ability to meet licensing requirements enacted or promulgated in each state (sometimes based on model laws and regulations developed by the NAIC), subject to significant variations across states. If we are unable to satisfy the applicable licensing requirements of any particular state, we could lose our license to do business in such state, which would result in the temporary or permanent cessation of our operations in that state. Alternatively, if we are unable to satisfy applicable state licensing requirements, we may be subject to additional regulatory oversight, have our license suspended, face monetary penalties, or be subject to seizure of assets. Any such events could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 In addition, as a condition to writing business in certain states, insurance companies are often subject to assessment, required to participate in various pools or risk sharing mechanisms or to accept certain classes of risk, regardless of whether such risks meet their underwriting requirements for voluntary business. The performance of this business may negatively impact us. Some states also limit or impose restrictions on the ability of an insurer to withdraw from certain classes of business. Certain states impose significant restrictions on a company s ability to materially reduce its exposures, non-renew, or to withdraw from certain lines of business. State insurance departments can impose significant charges on an insurer in connection with a market withdrawal or refuse to approve withdrawal plans including on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal of policies or that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may significantly restrict our ability to terminate unprofitable policies or to exit unprofitable markets. Such actions and related regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to reduce our potential exposure including, but not limited to, catastrophe events such as hurricane-related losses.

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts and by facsimile signature, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument. d. Any breach of Sections 4 or 5 will cause irreparable harm to Company for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore, Company will be entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition to any other remedies. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes, additions, modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys fees.
