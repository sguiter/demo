Accounts Receivable, Less Allowances 
 
 We utilize arrangements to sell portions of our trade accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in exchange for cash. The arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in trade receivables. Proceeds from the sales are reported net of negotiated discount and are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable outstanding in the company s consolidated balance sheets and as cash flows from operating activities in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows. Accounts receivable sold under these arrangements were billion and billion for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. 
 
 In certain instances, Sysco has continuing involvement subsequent to the transfer, limited to providing certain servicing and collection actions on behalf of the purchasers of the designated trade receivables. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of receivables that has been derecognized and remain outstanding was million and million at September 28, 2024 and June 29, 2024, respectively. We continue to service the receivables post-transfer on a non-recourse basis with no participating interest.

 In the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025, employees were granted performance share units (PSUs). Based on the jurisdiction in which the employee resides, some of these PSUs were granted with forfeitable dividend equivalents. The fair value of each PSU award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company s stock price as of the date of grant. For PSUs granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period. The weighted average grant-date fair value per PSU granted during the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 was . The PSUs will convert into shares of Sysco s common stock at the end of the performance period based on actual performance targets achieved, as well as the market-based return of Sysco s common stock relative to that of each company within the S P 500 index. 
 
 In the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025, employees were granted restricted stock units. The weighted average grant-date fair value per restricted stock unit granted during the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 was .

 was higher than the company s 21.0 statutory tax rate primarily as a result of state income taxes, and partially offset by a foreign income tax benefit and equity-based compensation excess tax benefits. 
 
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the company s effective tax rate of was higher than the company s statutory tax rate as a result of state income taxes, partially offset by a foreign income tax benefit. 
 
 Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefit and related accrued interest was million and million, respectively. It is reasonably possible the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain unrecognized tax positions of the company will increase or decrease in the next 12 months. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made. 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Sysco received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service, mainly related to foreign tax credits generated in fiscal 2018 from repatriated earnings primarily from our Canadian operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company filed suit in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the validity of certain tax regulations related to the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which were enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). The lawsuit seeks to have the court invalidate these regulations, which would affirm the company s position regarding its foreign tax credits. Sysco has previously recorded a benefit of million attributable to its interpretation of the TCJA and the Internal Revenue Code. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse all, or some portion, of the benefit previously recorded.

 On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which provides for a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. Pillar One expands a country s authority to tax profits from companies that make sales into their country but do not have a physical location in the country. Pillar Two includes an agreement on international tax reform, including rules to ensure that large corporations pay a minimum rate of corporate income tax. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15 . Pillar Two became effective for Sysco at the beginning of fiscal 2025. 
 
 The determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes reflects income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of June 29, 2024, and for the fiscal year then ended, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2024 (our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K), as well as the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) and notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) contained in this report. 

Highlights 
 
 Our first quarter of fiscal 2025 results were driven by sales growth of 4.4 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to U.S. Foodservice Operations volume growth and higher inflation. Our gross profit grew 2.9 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to volume growth and margin management. Operating income increased 0.5 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted operating income increased 2.2 due to sales growth and expense controls. See below for a comparison of our fiscal 2025 results to our fiscal 2024 results, both including and excluding Certain Items (as defined below). 
 
 Comparisons of results from the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 are presented below: 
 
 Sales: 
 increased 4.4 , or 864 million, to 20.5 billion; 
 Operating income: 
 increased 0.5 , or 4 million, to 808 million; 
 adjusted operating income increased 2.2 , or 19 million, to 873 million; 
 Net earnings: 
 decreased 2.6 , or 13 million, to 490 million; 
 adjusted net earnings decreased 0.4 , or 2 million, to 540 million; 
 Basic earnings per share: 
 unchanged, at 1.00 per share; 
 Diluted earnings per share: 
 unchanged, at 0.99 per share; 
 adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1.9 , or 0.02, to 1.09; 
 EBITDA: 
 increased 3.4 , or 34 million, to 1.0 billion; and 
 adjusted EBITDA increased 4.4 , or 45 million, to 1.1 billion. 
 
 The discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than EBITDA and free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove (1) restructuring charges; (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; (3) severance charges; and (4) acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions. 
 
 The fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 items discussed above are collectively referred to as Certain Items. The results of our operations can be impacted by changes in exchange rates applicable to converting from local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our results on a constant currency basis.

 Foot traffic to restaurants decreased 3.6 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025; however, traffic trends did improve as the quarter progressed. Foot traffic declined approximately 5 in July, approximately 4 in August, and approximately 3 in September. We expect modest industry traffic improvements in the second half of fiscal 2025. Despite the current macroeconomic landscape, we expect to grow both sales and net earnings in fiscal 2025. We believe the food-away-from-home sector is a healthy long-term market, and Sysco is diversified and well positioned as a market leader in food service.

Sales and Gross Profit Trends 
 
 Our sales and gross profit performance are influenced by multiple factors, including price, volume, inflation, customer mix and product mix. We experienced a 2.7 improvement in U.S. Foodservice Operations case volume in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Our volume growth was generated by 5.5 national volume growth and 0.2 local volume growth. Our volume reflects our broadline and specialty businesses, except for our specialty meats business, which measures its volume in pounds. 
 
 We experienced inflation at a rate of 2.2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, at the total enterprise level, primarily driven by inflation in the poultry and dairy categories. We continued to be successful in managing this inflation, resulting in an increase in gross profit dollars. Gross margin decreased 27 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to a shift in our customer mix driven by national volume growth, a decrease in Sysco brand penetration, and the timing of benefits from strategic sourcing initiatives. 
 
 Operating Expense Trends 
 
 Total operating expenses were 2.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a 3.6 increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Total adjusted operating expenses were 2.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a 3.1 increase as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating expenses increased primarily due to an increase in volumes. In addition, higher selling expenses, which includes sales professional hires, and depreciation expense related to new facilities also resulted in an increase in operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted operating expenses were 14.1 of sales, which is an 18-basis point improvement from the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to supply chain and Global Support Center efficiencies.

 13-Week Period Ended Sep. 28, 2024 13-Week Period Ended Sep. 30, 2023 Change in Dollars Change (Dollars in millions) Sales 14,362 13,724 638 4.6 Gross profit 2,747 2,685 62 2.3 Operating expenses 1,839 1,744 95 5.4 Operating income 908 941 (33) (3.5) Gross profit 2,747 2,685 62 2.3 Adjusted operating expenses (Non-GAAP) 1,822 1,731 91 5.3 Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) 925 954 (29) (3.0) 
 
 Sales 
 
 The following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in the major factors impacting sales as compared to the corresponding prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change: 
 Increase (Decrease) 13-Week Period (Dollars in millions) Cause of change Percentage Dollars Case volume (1) 
 2.5 353 Inflation 2.4 333 Other (2) 
 (0.3) (48) Total change in sales 4.6 638 
 (1) Case volumes increased 2.7 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This volume increase resulted in a 2.5 increase in the dollar value of sales compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 (2) 
 Case volume reflects our broadline and specialty businesses, with the exception of our specialty meats business, which measures its volume in pounds. Any impact in volumes from these operations are included within Other. 

The sales growth in our U.S. Foodservice Operations was driven by higher inflation and volume growth, inclusive of benefits from acquisitions. Case volumes from our U.S. Foodservice Operations increased 2.7 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This included a 0.2 increase in local customer case volume in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Our Edward Don acquisition, completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, positively impacted volumes by 2.6 and local volumes by 1.6 . Our national customer volume has grown faster than local customer volume and is the result of contract renewals with existing customers and the addition of new customers. 
 
 25 

Operating Income 
 
 The decrease in operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by gross profit dollar growth and case volume growth, inclusive of benefits from acquisitions. 
 
 Gross profit dollar growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, was driven primarily by case volume growth as a result of acquisitions and effective management of product cost fluctuations. The estimated change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of sales, was 19.1 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 for our U.S. Foodservice Operations, which was a decrease of 43 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to a change in customer mix, a decrease in Sysco brand penetration, and timing of benefits from strategic sourcing initiatives. 
 
 The increase in operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, was primarily driven by increased volumes. 

Results of International Foodservice Operations 
 
 The following table sets forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year: 
 
 13-Week Period Ended Sep. 28, 2024 13-Week Period Ended Sep. 30, 2023 Change in Dollars Change (Dollars in millions) Sales 3,794 3,683 111 3.0 Gross profit 774 732 42 5.7 Operating expenses 673 639 34 5.3 Operating income 101 93 8 8.6 Gross profit 774 732 42 5.7 Adjusted operating expenses (Non-GAAP) 644 616 28 4.5 Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) 130 116 14 12.1 Sales on a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) 3,789 3,683 106 2.9 Gross profit on a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) 769 732 37 5.1 Adjusted operating expenses on a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) 639 616 23 3.7 Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) 130 116 14 12.1

 1.8 64 Total change in sales 3.0 111 
 (1) 
 The impact of volumes as a component of sales growth from international operations are included within Other. 

Sales increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to higher inflation and an improvement in volume, primarily attributable to our Recipe for Growth initiatives. 
 
 Operating Income 
 
 The increase in operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, was due to growth in local case volumes and the ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuations. 
 
 The increase in gross profit dollars in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, was attributable to increases in sales volumes and the effective management of inflation. 
 
 The increase in operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, was primarily due to increases in colleague-related costs and the impact of foreign currency translation. 

Results of SYGMA and Other Segment 
 
 For SYGMA, sales were 7.3 higher in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by profit enhancements and growth resulting from the recent addition of new customers. Operating income increased by 5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 For the operations that are grouped within Other, operating income decreased 3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The operations of this group primarily consist of our hospitality business, Guest Worldwide. 

Global Support Center Expenses 
 
 Our Global Support Center generally includes all expenses of the corporate office and Sysco s shared service operations. These expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 30 million, or 11.8 , as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreases in colleague-related costs, fuel hedging program expenses, and other miscellaneous costs. 
 
 Included in Global Support Center expenses are Certain Items that totaled 19 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 14 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Certain Items impacting the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives and expenses associated with acquisitions. Certain Items impacting the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives and expenses associated with acquisitions. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense increased 26 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to interest on new senior notes that were issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as an increase in commercial paper borrowing activity. 
 27 

Net Earnings 
 
 Net earnings decreased 2.6 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the items noted above for operating income, and interest expense, as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. Adjusted net earnings, excluding Certain Items, decreased 0.4 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 Earnings Per Share 
 
 Basic earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were 1.00, which is unchanged from the comparable prior year amount of 1.00 per share. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were 0.99, which is unchanged from the comparable prior year period amount of 0.99 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding Certain Items, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were 1.09, a 1.9 increase from the comparable prior year amount of 1.07 per share. 

Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 
 The discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than EBITDA and free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove (1) restructuring charges; (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; (3) severance charges; and (4) acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions. 
 The results of our operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items and presenting its results on a constant currency basis provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results. It provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis. Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due diligence costs for those acquisitions. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco s results for fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024. Set forth on the following page is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not be equal to the total presented when added due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Highlights 
 
 We produced positive free cash flow of 8 million in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025, as compared to negative free cash flow of 73 million in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. The improvement in free cash flow is attributable to an increase in proceeds from sales of plant and equipment and a decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by operating activities. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities and comparisons of the significant cash flows from the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 to the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024 are provided.

 Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Performance Indicators contained in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K for discussions regarding this non-GAAP performance metric. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Sysco generates cash in the U.S. and internationally. As of September 28, 2024, we had 733 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 85 of which was held by our international subsidiaries. Sysco s strategic objectives are funded primarily by cash from operations and external borrowings. Traditionally, our operations have produced significant cash flow. Due to our strong financial position, we believe we will continue to be able to effectively access capital markets, as needed. Cash is generally allocated to working capital requirements, investments compatible with our overall growth strategy (organic and inorganic), debt management, and shareholder return. The remaining cash balances are invested in high-quality, short-term instruments. 
 
 We believe our cash flow from operations, the availability of liquidity under our commercial paper programs and our revolving credit facility, and our ability to access capital from financial markets will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for more than the next 12 months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes. 

Cash Flows 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 We generated 53 million in cash flows from operations in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025, compared to cash flows from operations of 87 million in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. In the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025, these amounts included year-over-year unfavorable comparisons on working capital of 29 million due to unfavorable comparisons on accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by a favorable comparison on accounts payable. Accrued expenses also had an unfavorable comparison, primarily related to accrued payroll in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 in comparison to the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. Income taxes positively impacted cash flows from operations, as estimated payments made in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 were lower compared to the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. Our first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonality. 
 
 Tax relief provided by the IRS related to the effects of Hurricane Beryl that began on July 5, 2024 resulted in the deferral of approximately 28 million of fiscal 2024 U.S. federal extension payments to the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Our first and second quarter U.S. estimated payments will also be deferred to the third quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our capital expenditures in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 consisted primarily of investments in buildings and building improvements, technology equipment, warehouse equipment, and fleet. Our capital expenditures in the first 13 weeks 
 34 

of fiscal 2025 were 49 million lower than in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024 due to reduced spending in investments to advance our Recipe for Growth strategy. 
 
 The first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024 includes 219 million of cash paid for the acquisition of BIX Produce Company. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Equity Transactions 
 
 Proceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards were 29 million in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025, as compared to 17 million in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. The level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire. 
 
 In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 5.0 billion of the company s common stock, which will remain available until fully utilized. We repurchased 1,439,652 shares for 108 million during the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 and intend to repurchase 1.0 billion in fiscal 2025. As of September 28, 2024, we had a remaining authorization of approximately 2.7 billion. We repurchased 20,413 additional shares for 2 million under our authorization through October 11, 2024. 
 
 Dividends paid in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2025 were 251 million, or 0.51 per share, as compared to 253 million, or 0.50 per share, in the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. In August 2024, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 of 0.51 per share, which was paid in October 2024. 
 
 Debt Activity and Borrowing Availability 
 
 Our debt activity, including issuances and repayments, if any, and our borrowing availability are described in Note 7, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. Our outstanding borrowings as of September 28, 2024 are also disclosed within that note. 

Guarantor Summarized Financial Information 
 
 On January 19, 2011, the wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries of Sysco Corporation, which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products, entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of Sysco Corporation. All subsequent issuances of senior notes and debentures in the U.S. and borrowings under the company s 3.0 billion long-term revolving credit facility have also been guaranteed by these subsidiaries. As of September 28, 2024, Sysco had a total of 10.5 billion in senior notes, debentures and borrowings under the long-term revolving credit facility that were guaranteed by these subsidiary guarantors. Our remaining consolidated subsidiaries (non-guarantor subsidiaries) are not obligated under the senior notes indenture, debentures indenture or our long-term revolving credit facility. See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources contained in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the terms of the guarantees. 
 
 Basis of Preparation of the Summarized Financial Information 
 
 The summarized financial information of Sysco Corporation (issuer), and certain wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries (guarantors) (together, the obligor group) is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated. Investments in and equity in the earnings of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, which are not members of the obligor group, have been excluded from the summarized financial information. The obligor group s amounts due to, amounts due from and transactions with non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented in separate line items, if they are material to the obligor financials. The following tables include summarized financial information of the obligor group for the periods presented.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. These require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting estimates pertain to goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and company-sponsored pension plans, which are described in Item 7 of our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Sysco s management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Sysco s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, Sysco s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental proceedings in which a governmental authority is a party to and when such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that Sysco s management reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to recent SEC amendments to this Item, Sysco has chosen a reporting threshold for such proceedings of 1 million. Applying this threshold, there are no material environmental matters to disclose for this reporting period.
