The acquisition of Land Air is expected to accelerate the expansion of the Company s national terminal footprint, particularly in the middle part of the United States, and strategically position the Company to better meet the current and future needs of customers.

The results of Land Air have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and from the date of acquisition. The associated goodwill has been included in the Company s Expedited Freight reportable segment. 
 
 Acquisition of Omni 
 
 On January 25, 2024, the Company completed the Omni Acquisition pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as amended by the Amended Merger Agreement. Omni, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is an asset-light, high-touch logistics and supply chain management company with customer relationships in high-growth end markets. Omni delivers domestic and international freight forwarding, fulfillment services, customs brokerage, distribution, and value-added services for time-sensitive freight to U.S.-based customers operating both domestically and internationally. Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, through a series of transactions involving the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, with the other transactions contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements referred to therein, the Transactions ), the Company acquired Omni for a combination of (a) in cash (which includes pre-acquisition Omni costs of approximately million) and (b) shares of the Company s outstanding common stock, on an as-converted and as-exchanged basis (the Equity Consideration consisting of: (i) shares of common stock (of which were issued upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Units upon approval of the Company s shareholders at the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting held on June 3, 2024 (the Conversion Approval )) and (ii) Opco Class B Units (as defined below) and corresponding Series B Preferred Units (as defined below), which are exchangeable into shares of Common Stock (of which units were issued upon conversion of the units of Opco (defined below) designated as Opco Series C-2 Preferred Units upon the Conversion Approval. The Equity Consideration represents, as of September 30, 2024, of the Company s outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted and as-exchanged basis. 
 
 Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, the Company completed a restructuring, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company contributed all of its operating assets to Clue Opco LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company Opco ). Opco has been structured as an umbrella partnership C corporation through which the existing direct and certain indirect equity holders of Omni Omni Holders hold a portion of the Equity Consideration in the form of units of Opco designated as Class B Units Opco Class B Units and corresponding Series B Preferred Units. Effective as of the Closing, the Company operates its business through Opco, which indirectly holds all of the assets and operations of the Company and Omni. Opco is governed by an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Opco that became effective at the Closing Opco LLCA ). 
 
 At the Closing, the Company, Opco, Omni Holders and certain other parties entered into a tax receivable agreement (the Tax Receivable Agreement ), which sets forth the agreement among the parties regarding the sharing of certain tax benefits realized by the Company as a result of the Transactions. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Company is generally obligated to pay certain Omni Holders of (a) the total tax benefit that the Company realizes as a result of increases in tax basis in Opco s assets resulting from certain actual or deemed distributions and the future exchange of units of Opco for shares of securities of the Company (or cash) pursuant to the Opco LLCA, (b) certain pre-existing tax attributes of certain Omni Holders that are corporate entities for tax purposes, (c) the tax benefits that the Company realizes from certain tax allocations that correspond to items of income or gain required to be recognized by certain Omni Holders, and (d) other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

 The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including the consideration transferred are based on the Company s best estimates and assumptions using the information available as of the acquisition date through the date of this filing. As a part of the Omni Acquisition, the interest in Opco not owned by Company was valued to be on January 25, 2024 and is disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of this acquisition on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary areas of the acquisition accounting that are not yet finalized include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) finalizing the review and valuation of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities (including the key assumptions, inputs, and estimates) and (2) finalizing the identification of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and identified. Actual values may differ (possibly materially) when final information becomes available that differs from our current estimates. We believe that the information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company expects to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired, the Company recorded an increase of million to the Goodwill recognized. The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The Company initially recorded the purchase price allocation on initial estimates, and in the three months ended September 30, 2024 an updated valuation was performed. The effects of the remeasuring the intangible assets resulted in a reduction of million in amortization expense for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2024, recognized in Depreciation and amortization on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) income.

 Acquisition Impairment ) ) Balance as of September 30, 2024 
 
 The Company's accumulated impairment loss for the Omni Logistics segment is as of September 30, 2024. The Company s accumulated goodwill impairment also includes related to impairment charges the Company recorded during 2016 pertaining to its Truckload Services reporting unit. The Truckload Services reporting unit operates within the Expedited Freight reportable segment. 
 
 The Company tests goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually as of June 30 and when events or circumstances indicate that fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, for example, a component. If the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value, the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value is recognized as an impairment to the reporting unit's goodwill. 
 
 The Company s annual impairment analyses were performed as of June 30, 2024 for all reporting units. For the reporting units in the Expedited Freight and Intermodal reportable segments, we performed a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and these reporting units continue to result in an excess of fair value over carrying value. 
 
 The Omni reporting unit s fair value was calculated using a DCF model and a guideline public company method, with each method weighted equally. Under the DCF model, the fair value of a reporting unit is the present value of estimated future cash flows and is based on all known or knowable information at the measurement date. Under the guideline public company method, the fair value is based upon market multiples derived from publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit. The inputs to both the DCF and the guideline public company method are Level 3 valuation inputs. Primarily due to a decrease in the market value of the Company s common stock during the second quarter of 2024, as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, general market factors, credit rating downgrades, and changes in executive leadership, and the inherent uncertainty associated with the combined enterprise, the Omni Logistics reporting unit s fair value was determined to be less than its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Due to measurement period adjustments in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an additional of goodwill impairment was recorded. The cumulative goodwill impairment through the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is . The goodwill impairment expense was recorded in the Impairment of goodwill caption on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 Additionally, as qualifying measurement-period adjustments are made to the Omni purchase price allocation, which is not yet finalized (See Note 4, Acquisitions), further adjustments to the goodwill impairment may be required.

 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility 
 
 In order to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable for the Omni Acquisition and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction, GN Loanco, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Omni, (the Escrow Loan Borrower and consolidated VIE), entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent and as initial term loan lender on December 19, 2023. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Escrow Loan Borrower obtained senior secured term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of (the New Term Loans and the ability to draw down up to under a line of credit (the Revolving Credit Facility ).

 above the overnight federal funds rate; and (iii) the one-month Term SOFR plus . The applicable margin for Term SOFR loans is and the applicable margin for base rate loans is . The New Term Loans are subject to customary amortization of per year. The New Term Loans were issued at of the face amount and will mature on December 19, 2030. 
 
 borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were made in connection with the Omni Acquisition. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on January 25, 2029. Loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest based, at Opco s election, on (a) SOFR plus an applicable margin or (b) the base rate plus an applicable margin. Until delivery of a compliance certificate in respect of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, the applicable margin for SOFR loans is and the applicable margin for base rate loans is . Thereafter, the applicable margin can range from to for SOFR loans and from to for base rate loans, in each case depending on Opco s first lien net leverage ratio, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Upon closing of the Omni Acquisition, Opco assumed the Escrow Loan Borrower s obligations under the Credit Agreement, which were further secured by certain guarantors. Opco s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company and each of Opco s existing and future domestic subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions). 
 
 On February 12, 2024, Opco and the parties to the Credit Agreement entered into Amendment No. 2 Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, which (a) modifies the financial performance covenant in the Credit Agreement by temporarily increasing the :1.00 maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio permitted by the covenant to (i) :1.00 (for the second and third quarters of 2024), (ii) :1.00 (for the fourth quarter of 2024), (iii) :1.00 (for the first quarter of 2025), (iv) :1.00 (for the second quarter of 2025) and (v) :1.00 (for the third quarter of 2025) and (b) reduces the revolving credit commitments available under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate principal amount of to an aggregate principal amount of . If the financial performance covenant is not met, the Company will lose access to the Revolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 2 also amends certain other terms of the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 2, on February 12, 2024, Opco repaid aggregate principal amount of the New Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. 
 
 Both the Notes and Revolving Credit Facility contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company, without the approval of the required lenders, to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, asset sales, dividends and stock repurchases, investments, and other transactions or to incur liens or indebtedness in excess of agreed thresholds, as set forth in the Credit Agreemen t. As of the date of this report, the Company was in compliance with these aforementioned covenants.

 Former Credit Facility 
 
 In September 2017, the Company entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility with a maximum aggregate principal amount of , with a sublimit of for letters of credit and a sublimit of for swing line loans. The maturity date of the Facility was September 29, 2022. In April 2020, the Company entered into the first amendment to the Facility, which increased the maximum aggregate principal amount to . The Facility could have been increased by up to to a maximum aggregate principal amount of pursuant to the terms of the amended credit agreement, subject to the lenders agreement to increase their commitments or the addition of new lenders extending such commitments. In July 2021, the Company entered into the second amendment to the Facility, which extended the maturity date to July 20, 2026 and changed the interest rate options available under the Facility. In December 2021, the Company entered into the third amendment to the Facility, which increased the amount available for borrowing under the Facility to , consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan of . In connection with the third amendment, the Company borrowed under the term loan and simultaneously repaid on the revolving line of credit from the borrowings received. Under the third amendment, the Facility could have been increased by up to to a maximum aggregate principal amount of pursuant to the terms of the amended credit agreement, subject to the lenders agreement to increase their commitments or the addition of new lenders extending such commitments. Such increases to the Facility could have been in the form of additional revolving credit loans, term loans or a combination thereof, and were contingent upon there being no events of default under the Facility. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023 the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Facility. borrowings were made under the Facility prior to the extinguishment upon the Closing.

 and income tax expense of , respectively. The effective tax rate of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 varied from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to the effect of the tax impact of the goodwill impairment charge, noncontrolling interest, partially offset by state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, and foreign taxes. The effective tax rate of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 varied from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to the effect of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, and non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by excess tax benefits realized on share-based awards. 
 
 The Company recognizes income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions where the realization of the ultimate benefit is uncertain. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had of unrecognized income tax benefits, all of which would affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of . With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or Canadian examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017. 
 
 The Company also maintains a valuation allowance to reserve against its state net operating loss carryforwards of . A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company assessed the likelihood that its deferred tax assets would be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. In making this assessment, all available evidence was considered including economic climate, as well as reasonable tax planning strategies. The Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize its remaining net deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, in future years. 
 
 In connection with the Omni Acquisition, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with certain Omni Holders. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a Tax Receivable Agreement liability of approximately , after concluding that such Tax Receivable Agreement payments would be probable based on estimates of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The determination of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability requires the Company to make judgments in estimating the amount of tax attributes as of the date of exchanges (such as cash to be received by the Company on a hypothetical sale of assets and allocation of gain or loss to the Company at the time of the exchanges taking into consideration partnership tax rules). The amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will also vary depending upon a number of factors, including tax rates in effect, as well as the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income of Opco in the future and the expected realization of tax benefits with respect to deferred tax assets related to tax attributes subject to Tax Receivable Agreement, which may result in a valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets. If other tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement are determined to be payable, additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities may be considered probable at that time.

 of our shareholders, filed a complaint against us and certain of its directors and officers in the Third District Chancery Court sitting in Greeneville, Tennessee (the "Shareholder Complaint"). The Shareholder Complaint alleges, among other things, that our shareholders have the right to vote on certain transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and sought an injunction against the consummation of the transaction until a shareholder vote was held. The court initially granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement but later dissolved it on October 25, 2023. Thereafter and as described below, on the Closing, the parties to the Amended Merger Agreement completed the Omni Acquisition. On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff Michael Roberts, together with the Cambria County Employees Retirement System filed a stipulation and proposed order seeking leave of court to file an amended class action complaint seeking damages, among other forms of relief. Upon receiving leave of the court, on May 15, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed the amended complaint. Like the earlier complaints, it challenges our determination not to subject the Omni Acquisition to a shareholder vote. We disagree with the allegations of the amended complaint and are in the process of defending the matter. 
 
 The Company is party to various legal claims and actions incidental to its business, including claims related to vehicle liability, workers compensation, property damage and employee medical benefits. The Company accrues for the uninsured portion of contingent losses from these and other pending claims when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on the knowledge of the facts, the Company believes the resolution of claims and pending litigation, taking into account existing reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the Company s view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold. 
 
 Insurance coverage provides the Company with primary and excess coverage for claims related to vehicle liability, workers compensation, property damage and employee medical benefits.

 For each and every accident/incident, the Company is responsible for damages and defense up to these amounts, regardless of the number of claims associated with any accident/incident. 

Also, from time to time, when brokering freight, the Company may face claims for the negligent selection of outside, contracted carriers that are involved in accidents, and the Company maintains third-party liability insurance coverage with a deductible per occurrence for most of its brokered services. The Company maintains workers compensation insurance with a self-insured retention of per occurrence. 
 
 Insurance coverage in excess of the self-insured retention limit is an important part of the Company s risk management process. The Company accrues for the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims within the self-insured retention based on the nature and severity of individual claims and historical claims development trends. The Company believes the recorded reserves are sufficient for all incurred claims up to the self-insured retention limits, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. However, estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts is inherently difficult, and the Company may fail to establish sufficient insurance reserves and adequately estimate for future insurance claims. Since the ultimate resolution of outstanding claims as well as claims incurred but not reported is uncertain, it is possible that the reserves recorded for these losses could change materially in the near term. Although, an estimate cannot be made of the range of additional loss that is at least reasonably possible.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 
 
 We are a leading asset-light freight provider of transportation services, including LTL, truckload and intermodal drayage services and freight brokerage and supply chain services across North and South America, Europe, and Asia. We offer premium services that typically require precision execution, such as expedited transit, delivery during tight time windows and special handling. We utilize an asset-light strategy to minimize our investments in equipment and facilities and to reduce our capital expenditures. 
 
 Our services are classified into three reportable segments: Expedited Freight, Intermodal and Omni Logistics. 
 
 Our Expedited Freight segment provides expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services. Expedited Freight also offers customers local pick-up and delivery and other services including truckload, shipment consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, customs brokerage and other handling. We plan to grow our LTL geographic footprint through greenfield start-ups as well as through acquisitions. 
 
 Our Intermodal segment provides first- and last-mile high value intermodal container drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads. Intermodal also offers dedicated contract and CFS warehouse and handling services, and in select locations, linehaul and LTL services. We plan to grow our Intermodal geographic footprint through acquisitions as well as through greenfield start-ups where no suitable acquisition is available. 
 
 Our Omni Logistics segment provides a full suite of global logistics services. Services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding, customs brokerage, warehousing and distribution, time-definite transportation services and other supply chain solutions. 
 
 Our operations, particularly our network of hubs and terminals, represent substantial fixed costs. Consequently, our ability to increase our earnings depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound or shipment for the freight shipped or moved through our network. Additionally, our earnings depend on the growth of other services, such as LTL pickup and delivery, which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in a challenging freight environment. We continue to focus on creating synergies across our services, particularly with services offered in our Expedited Freight reportable segment. Synergistic opportunities include the ability to share resources, in particular our fleet resources. 
 
 We monitor and analyze a number of key operating statistics in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. These key operating statistics are defined below and are referred to throughout the discussion of the financial results of our Expedited Freight and Intermodal reportable segments. Our key operating statistics should not be interpreted as better measurements of our results than income from operations as determined under GAAP. 
 
 Within our Expedited Freight reportable segment, our primary revenue focus is to increase density, which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing LTL network. Increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity, which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor and door pounds handled per hour. In addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies, it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield, which is measured as revenue per hundredweight, on the shipments we handle to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. Revenue per hundredweight is also a commonly-used indicator for general pricing trends in the LTL industry and can be influenced by many other factors, such as changes in fuel surcharges, weight per shipment and length of haul. Therefore, changes in revenue per hundredweight may not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates. We regularly monitor the components of our pricing, including base freight rates, accessorial charges and fuel surcharges. The fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of the petroleum-based products used in our operations and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the U.S. Department of Energy. The impact of fuel on our results of operations depends on the relationship between the applicable surcharge, the fuel efficiency of our Company drivers, and the load factor achieved by our operation. Fluctuations in fuel prices in either direction could have a positive or negative impact on our margins, particularly in our LTL business where the weight of a shipment subject to the fuel surcharge on a given trailer can vary materially. We believe our yield management process focused on account level profitability, and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies, are both key components of our ability to grow profitably. 
 
 30 

The key operating statistics necessary to understand the operating results of our Expedited Freight reportable segment are described below in more detail: 
 
 Tonnage - Total weight of shipments in pounds. The level of freight tonnage is affected by economic cycles and conditions, customers business cycles, changes in customers business practices and capacity in the truckload market. 
 
 Weight Per Shipment - Total pounds divided by the number of shipments. Fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the mix of freight we receive from our customers, as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment. Generally, increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand and overall increased economic activity. Changes in weight per shipment can also be influenced by shifts between LTL and other modes of transportation, such as truckload, in response to capacity, service and pricing issues. Fluctuations in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as a decrease in weight per shipment will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight. 
 
 Revenue Per Hundredweight - Network revenue per every 100 pounds of shipment weight. Our LTL transportation services are generally priced based on weight, commodity, and distance. Our pricing policies are reflective of the services we provide, and can be influenced by competitive market conditions. Changes in the freight profile factors such as average shipment size, average length of haul, freight density, and customer and geographic mix can impact the revenue per hundredweight. Fuel surcharges and intercompany revenue between Network and Truckload are included in this measurement. 
 
 Revenue Per Shipment - Network revenue divided by the number of shipments. Fuel surcharges and intercompany revenue between Network and Truckload are included in this measurement. 
 
 Average Length of Haul - Total miles between origin and destination service centers for all shipments, with miles based on the size of shipments. Length of haul is used to analyze our tonnage and pricing trends for shipments with similar characteristics. Changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight. 
 
 Within our Intermodal reportable segment, our primary revenue focus is to increase the number of shipments. The key operating statistic necessary to understand the operating results of our Intermodal reportable segment is described below in more detail: 
 
 Drayage Revenue Per Shipment - Intermodal revenue divided by the number of drayage shipments. Revenue derived from container freight station warehouse and handling, and linehaul and LTL services is excluded from this measurement. Fuel surcharges and accessorial charges are included in this measurement. 
 
 Trends and Developments 
 
 Economy 
 
 Our business is highly susceptible to changes in economic conditions. Our products and services are directly tied to the production and sale of goods and, more generally, to the global economy. Participants in the transportation industry have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recessions, downturns in the business cycles of customers, volatility in the prices charged by third-party carriers, interest rate fluctuations and other U.S. and global macroeconomic developments. During economic downturns, reductions in overall demand for transportation services will likely reduce demand for our services and exert downward pressure on our rates and margins. In periods of strong economic growth, overall demand may exceed the available supply of transportation resources. While this may present an opportunity to increase economies of scale in our network and enhanced pricing and margins, these benefits may be lessened by increased network congestion and operating inefficiencies. 

31 

Like other providers of freight transportation services, our business has been impacted by the macroeconomic conditions of the past year. International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions and foreign investment. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to tariffs and impose trade restrictions. We cannot predict the outcome of changes in tariffs, or interpretations, and trade restrictions and the effects they will have on our business. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being influenced by governmental policies, our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the United States and other countries, as well as economic turbulence, political unrest and security concerns in the nations and on the trade shipping lanes in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade. 
 
 Our ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities, including airlines, ocean carrier lines and ground transportation providers. We consider our current working relationships with these entities strong and beneficial to the Company. However, changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of asset-based carriers, capacity allotments available from carriers could affect our business in unpredictable ways. When the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption, the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly. This carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact our ability to maintain historical profitability. 
 
 The global economic and trade environments remain uncertain, including inflation remaining higher than historical levels, greater volatility in oil prices and high interest rates. Starting in the second quarter of 2022 and continuing through most of 2023, we saw a slowdown in the global economy and a softening of customer demand resulting in declines in rates. As demand remains soft, available transportation capacity continues to exceed demand. These conditions have continued to impact our rates negatively in 2024. We also expect that pricing volatility will continue as carriers adapt to lower demand, changing fuel prices, security risks and react to governmental trade policies and other regulations. 
 
 Fuel 
 
 We depend heavily upon the availability of adequate diesel fuel supplies, and recently, fuel availability and prices have fluctuated significantly. Fuel availability and prices can be impacted by factors beyond our control, such as natural or man made disasters, adverse weather conditions, political events, economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, disruptions or failure of technology or information systems, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, armed conflict, tariffs, sanctions, other changes to trade agreements and world supply and demand imbalance. Through our fuel surcharge programs, we have been able to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. Our fuel surcharge rates are set weekly based on the national average for fuel prices as published by the U.S. Department of Energy and our fuel surcharge table. In periods of changing fuel prices, our fuel surcharges vary by different degrees and may not fully offset fuel price fluctuations or may result in higher than expected increases in revenue. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the potential volatility in fuel surcharge revenue may impact our results of operations and overall profitability. Fuel surcharge revenue as a percentage of operating revenues decreased to 9.2 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.6 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the inclusion of Omni in the results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 .

Operating Revenues 
 
 Operating revenues increased 314,961, or 92.4 , to 655,937 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 340,976 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of 334,538 from the Omni Logistics segment and an increase in our Expedited Freight segment of 5,832 due to increased Truckload revenue, offset by a decrease from our Intermodal segment of 4,771. The results for our reportable segments are discussed in detail in the following sections. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 303,953, or 92.3 , to 633,240 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 329,287 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the 333,402 of operating expenses from the Omni Logistics segment and a 19,110 increase in operating expenses from the Expedited Freight segment due to margin compression, partially offset by a 4,118 volume driven decrease in operating expenses from the Intermodal segment. Purchased transportation expense, given our asset-light model, is our largest expense which includes our independent contractor fleet owners and owner-operators, who lease their equipment to our motor carriers Leased Capacity Providers ), third-party motor carriers and capacity secured by transportation intermediaries, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. 
 Income from Continuing Operations and Segment Operations 
 Income from operations decreased 11,008, or 94.2 , to a 22,697 loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 11,689 of income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Omni Logistics segment of 1,136, and Expedited Freight segment of 13,278. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net was 52,770 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,655 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher borrowings outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 and an increase in the average interest rate. In connection with the Omni Acquisition, the outstanding borrowings remained steady in the third quarter of 2024. The weighted-average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings were 9.56 and 6.62 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Income Taxes on a Continuing Basis 
 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (4.0) compared to 28.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate varied from the statutory United States federal rate of 21 in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the cumulative effect of the noncontrolling interest, and to a lesser extent foreign earnings and state income taxes, net of the federal benefit. 
 
 Income from Discontinued Operations, net of Tax 
 
 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax increased 3,932 or 140.7 to net loss of 1,137 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income of 2,795 for the same period in 2023. The increase was due to the final net working capital settlement following the sale of our Final Mile business in December 2023. 
 
 Net (Loss) Income 
 
 As a result of the foregoing factors, net income decreased 44,623, to a 35,335 loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9,288 income for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating Revenues 
 Expedited Freight operating revenues increased 5,832, or 2.1 , to 284,707 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 278,875 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased Truckload revenue. Truckload revenue increased 4,835, primarily due to increased customer demand for our services as compared to the same period in 2023. Network revenue increased due to a 4.0 increase in pounds per day, offset by a 0.5 decrease in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in tonnage reflects an increase in weight per shipment of 4.5 on 0.5 less shipments per day. The increase in weight per shipment was the result of more dense freight in our network driven by a change in the mix of freight in our network. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased 5,499, or 9.4 as a result of the higher tonnage in our Network as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Purchased Transportation 
 Expedited Freight purchased transportation increased 10,185, or 7.8 , to 140,035 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 129,850 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Expedited Freight purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party motor carriers and transportation intermediaries, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. The increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to higher volumes in Network, and the change in the mix of freight capacity purchased from Leased Capacity Providers, third-party motor carriers and transportation intermediaries and Company-employed drivers for Truckload services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 63.5 , 33.1 and 3.4 of our freight capacity was purchased from Leased Capacity Providers, third-party motor carriers and transportation intermediaries and Company-employed drivers, respectively, for Network and Truckload.

 Operating Leases 
 Expedited Freight operating leases increased 1,164, or 8.1 , to 15,556 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 14,392 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating leases were 5.5 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.2 for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating lease expense was primarily due to higher leasing costs associated lease renewals in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Expedited Freight depreciation and amortization increased 1,459, or 16.2 , to 10,481 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,022 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization was 3.7 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.2 for the same period in 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily as the result of purchasing and placing in service new equipment in the second half of 2023 and first half of 2024. 
 Insurance and Claims 
 Expedited Freight insurance and claims increased 2,139, or 22.4 , to 11,672 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,533 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating Revenues 
 
 Operating revenues increased 809,109, or 78.4 to 1,841,416 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,032,307 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of 871,232 from the Omni Logistics segment and an increase in our Expedited Freight segment revenue of 31,396 due to increased Network revenue, offset by a decrease from our Intermodal segment of 41,600, The results for our reportable segments are discussed in detail in the following sections. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 2,033,110, or 214.7 , to 2,980,207 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 947,097 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the 2,004,555 of operating expenses from the Omni Logistics segment which includes a goodwill impairment charge of 1,107,465 and a 59,978 increase in operating expenses from the Expedited Freight segment, partially offset by a 34,335 decrease in operating expenses from the Intermodal segment. 
 Loss from Operations and Segment Operations 
 
 Loss from operations changed by 1,224,001, to 1,138,791 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income of 85,210 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The loss was primarily driven by Omni Logistics segment of 1,133,323 as a result of a goodwill impairment charge of 1,107,465, Other Operations of 54,831, Expedited Freight segment of 28,582, and our Intermodal segment of 7,265. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net was 140,788 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7,595 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to higher variable interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on outstanding debt balances as compared to the same period in 2023. The weighted-average interest rate on the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 9.56 and 6.24 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Income Taxes on a Continuing basis 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.0 compared to a rate of 25.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the current nine months is much lower than historical rate due to the goodwill impairment charge in the current year. 
 
 (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, net of Tax 
 
 Loss from discontinued operations of 6,013, net of tax increased, resulted in an unfavorable change of 14,096 or 174 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income of 8,083 during the same period in 2023. The loss was due to final net working capital settlement following the sale of our Final Mile business in December 2023. 
 
 Net (Loss) Income 
 
 As a result of the foregoing factors, net income decreased 1,161,083, or 1,769.8 , to a loss of 1,095,476 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 65,607 income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating Revenues 
 Expedited Freight operating revenues increased 31,396, or 3.8 , to 849,284 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 817,888 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by increased Network revenue and Truckload revenue. Network revenue increased due to a 6.2 increase in tonnage, offset by a 1.8 decrease in revenue per hundredweight ex fuel as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in tonnage reflects an increase in weight per shipment of 4.6 on 1.4 more shipments. The increase in shipments is due to higher demand for our services while the increase in weight per shipment was the result of more dense freight in our network driven by a change in the mix of services provided to customers. Truckload revenue increased 4,392, primarily due to increased customer demand for our services as compared to the same period in 2023. Higher tonnage, higher shipment count, and higher revenue per shipment contributed to the overall increase in operating revenues for the Expedited Freight segment. 
 
 Purchased Transportation 
 Expedited Freight purchased transportation increased 31,141, or 8.2 , to 410,307 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 379,166 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Purchased transportation was 48.3 of Expedited Freight operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 46.4 for the same period in 2023. Expedited Freight purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party motor carriers and transportation intermediaries, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. The increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to higher volumes in the Network and the change in the mix of freight capacity purchased from Leased Capacity Providers, third-party motor carriers and transportation intermediaries and Company-employed drivers for Network and Truckload services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 63.8 , 33.2 and 4.0 of our freight capacity from Leased Capacity Providers, third-party motor carriers and transportation intermediaries and Company-employed drivers, respectively. This compares to 65.1 , 30.1 and 4.8 in the same period in 2023. 
 Salaries, Wages, and Employee Benefits 
 Expedited Freight salaries, wages and employee benefits increased 15,587, or 9.2 , to 185,824 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 170,237 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 21.9 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.8 for the same period in 2023. The increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits expense was primarily due to higher Company-employed driver count in response to the higher volumes and an increase in salaries and wage rates compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Operating Leases 
 Expedited Freight operating leases decreased 1,063, or 2.3 , to 45,268 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 46,331 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating leases were 5.3 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.7 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in operating leases expense was primarily due to fewer equipment leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Expedited Freight depreciation and amortization increased 6,376, or 25.4 , to 31,463 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 25,087 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization was 3.7 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.1 for the same period in 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily the result of purchasing and placing in service new equipment in the second half of 2023 and first half of 2024.

Insurance and Claims 
 Expedited Freight insurance and claims increased 4,437, or 15.4 , to 33,293 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 28,856 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Insurance and claims were 3.9 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.5 for the same period in 2023. The increase in insurance and claims expense was primarily due to an increase in equipment repair claims, vehicle liability and cargo claims, and insurance premiums, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Expedited Freight other operating expenses increased 4,350, or 6.1 , to 75,288 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 70,938 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating expenses were 9.0 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.6 for the same period in 2023. Other operating expenses include contract labor, equipment maintenance, facility expenses, legal and professional fees, and other over-the-road costs. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in software license and subscription fees and utilities and communications expenses, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees, maintenance and repair expense and supply parts, for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Income from Operations 
 Expedited Freight income from operations decreased 28,582, or 32.0 , to 60,713 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 89,295 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income from operations was 7.1 of Expedited Freight operating revenues for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.9 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in income was primarily a result of 8.2 higher purchased transportation and wage and benefits expenses without sufficient increase in total operating revenue of 3.8 growth.

Operating Revenues 
 
 Intermodal operating revenues decreased 41,600, or 19.4 , to 173,003 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 214,603 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a 9.1 decrease in drayage shipments and a decrease in drayage revenue per shipment of 12.4 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in drayage shipments and lower accessorial revenue to support customers was primarily due to challenged market demand for our services driven by an extended weak freight environment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Purchased Transportation 
 
 Intermodal purchased transportation decreased 1,952, or 3.4 , to 54,916 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 56,868 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Purchased transportation was 31.7 of Intermodal operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.5 for the same period in 2023. Intermodal purchased transportation includes Leased Capacity Providers and third-party motor carriers, while Company-employed drivers are included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. The decrease in purchased transportation was primarily due to fewer drayage shipments and the change in the mix of freight capacity purchased from Lease Capacity Providers, third-party motor carriers and Company-employed drivers compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Salaries, Wages, and Employee Benefits 
 
 Intermodal salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased 7,195, or 13.9 , to 44,487 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 51,682 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 25.7 of Intermodal operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.1 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits expense was primarily due to fewer Company-employed drivers in response to lower volumes as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Operating Leases 
 
 Intermodal operating leases decreased 5,038, or 25.0 , to 15,136 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 20,174 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating leases were 8.7 of Intermodal operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.4 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in operating leases expense was primarily due to decreased equipment rental expense incurred to support the decreased accessorial revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Intermodal depreciation and amortization decreased 818, or 5.5 , to 13,921 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14,739 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization was 8.0 of Intermodal operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 6.9 for the same period in 2023 . The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to minimal new asset additions during the period and some equipment disposals and assets having reached their full depreciable lives.

Fuel Expense 
 
 Intermodal fuel expense decreased 2,210, or 25.2 , to 6,546 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8,756 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Fuel expense was 3.8 of Intermodal operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.1 for the same period in 2023. Intermodal fuel expense decreased due to fewer miles driven by Company-employed drivers and a decrease in the average price of fuel for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 
 Intermodal other operating expenses decreased 16,953, or 49.6 , to 17,250 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 34,203 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating expenses were 10.1 of Intermodal operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.9 for the same period in 2023. Other operating expenses include contract labor, equipment maintenance, facility expenses, legal and professional fees, and accessorial storage costs. The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily driven by lower accessorial storage costs incurred to support the decreased accessorial revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Income from Operations 
 
 Intermodal income from operations decreased by 7,265, or 35.9 , to 12,994 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20,259 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income from operations was 7.5 of Intermodal operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.4 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in income from operations as a percentage of operating revenues was driven by 12.4 lower drayage revenue per shipment on 9.1 fewer drayage shipments and 1.90 higher overall operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Other Operations - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Other operations included a 79,175 operating loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 24,344 operating loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the operating loss was primarily driven by 71,393 of post-acquisition transaction and integration costs incurred in connection with the Omni Acquisition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue adjustments, deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions, goodwill, other intangible and long-lived assets, and self-insurance loss reserves. Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A description of critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates that affect the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2023. The following supplements the 2023 Annual Form 10-K. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually as of June 30 and on an interim basis when events occur or circumstances exist that carrying value may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow (DCF), or as appropriate, a combination of the DCF and market approach known as the guideline public company approach. Under the DCF model, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit under the present value of estimated cash flows. The significant assumptions in the DCF model primarily include, but are not limited to, forecast of annual revenue growth rates, annual operating income margin, and the terminal growth rate and the discount rate used to present value the cash flow projections. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we consider historical performance trends, and the reporting units underlying business and other market trends that may affect the reporting unit. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the industry in which the reporting unit operates. Under the guideline public company method, we estimate the fair value based upon market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. 
 52 

Table of Contents 

Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in our strategy, changes in technology or other factors could negatively affect the fair value in one or more of our reporting units and result in a material impairment charge in the future. 
 
 To assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium. 
 
 2024 Annual Goodwill Analysis 
 
 The annual test of goodwill was performed for each of the reporting units with goodwill balances as of June 30, 2024. To complete the Omni Logistics goodwill test, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit using the DCF model and a guideline public company approach with 50 of the value determined using the DCF and 50 of the value using the market approach. As a result of the annual test, we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling 1,092,714 million which all related to our Omni Logistics reporting unit. This reporting unit was acquired on January 25, 2024. Primarily due to a decrease in the market value of the Company s common stock during the second quarter of 2024, as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, general market factors, credit rating downgrades, and changes in executive leadership, and the inherent uncertainty associated with the combined enterprise, the Omni Logistics reporting unit s fair value was determined to be less than its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 1,092,714 during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Due to measurement period adjustments in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an additional 14,751 of goodwill impairment was recorded. The cumulative goodwill impairment through the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is 1,107,465. The goodwill impairment expense was recorded in the Impairment of goodwill caption on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. To complete the Omni Logistics goodwill test, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit using the DCF model and a guideline public company approach with 50 of the value determined using the DCF and 50 of the value using the market approach. 
 
 Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Purchase price allocation of Omni Logistics is not yet complete, and as a result, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impairment charge in the future. 
 
 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets 
 
 The Company reviews its long-lived assets, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for recoverability is performed at a level where independent cash flows may be attributed to either an asset or asset group. The analysis differs from our goodwill impairment test in that an intangible or other long-lived asset is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to the assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of the assets. If the forecasted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the assets are written down to estimated value. We did not identify any impairments of definite-lived assets in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Changes in the estimates of forecasted net cash flows may result in future asset impairments that could be material to our results of operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have historically financed our working capital needs, including capital expenditures, with available cash, cash flows from operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In the first quarter of 2024, our then existing credit facility was repaid and extinguished in tandem with the Omni Acquisition. We believe that availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and our New Term Loans, together with available cash and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements over the next twelve months. As previously disclosed and more fully described below and in Note 4, Acquisitions, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the Omni Acquisition. This substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to the factors as more fully discussed in the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Indebtedness . In addition, we frequently utilize operating leases to acquire revenue equipment.

Senior Secured Notes 
 In order to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable for the Omni Acquisition and the costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, GN Bondco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Omni (the Escrow Issuer and consolidated VIE at December 31, 2023) launched a private offering of 725,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes, in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act. Upon the closing of the Omni Acquisition, Opco assumed the Escrow Issuer s obligations under the Notes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.5 per annum, payable semiannually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2024. The Notes were issued at 98.0 of the face amount and will mature on October 15, 2031. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of October 2, 2023, between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee and notes collateral agent. 
 
 The Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis in an aggregate principal amount in excess of 100,000. Prior to October 15, 2026, Opco may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100.000 of the principal amount thereof plus the applicable make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after October 15, 2026, Opco may redeem some or all of the Notes at the following prices (expressed as a percentage of principal), plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date: (a) in the case of a redemption occurring during the 12-month period commencing October 15, 2026, at a redemption price of 104.750 ; (b) in the case of a redemption occurring during the 12-month period commencing on October 15, 2027, at a redemption price of 102.375 ; and (c) in the case of a redemption occurring on or after October 15, 2028, at a redemption price of 100.000 . In addition, at any time prior to October 15, 2026, Opco may redeem up to 40.000 of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes in an amount not to exceed the amount of net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 109.5 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of a change of control , Opco will be required to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes at a purchase price of 101.000 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. 
 
 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility 
 In order to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable for the Omni Acquisition and the costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, GN Loanco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Omni (the Escrow Loan Borrower and consolidated VIE at December 31, 2023), entered into the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Escrow Loan Borrower obtained the New Term Loans and the ability to draw down up to 400,000 under the Revolving Credit Facility. The New Term Loans bear interest based, at Opco s election, on (a) SOFR plus an applicable margin or (b) the base rate plus an applicable margin. The base rate is equal the highest of the following: (i) the prime rate; (ii) 0.50 above the overnight federal funds rate; and (iii) the one-month SOFR plus 1.00 . The applicable margin for SOFR loans is 4.50 and the applicable margin for base rate loans is 3.50 . The New Term Loans are subject to customary amortization of 1.00 per year. The New Term Loans were issued at 96.0 of the face amount and will mature on December 19, 2030. 
 
 No borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were made in connection with the Omni Acquisition. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on January 25, 2029. Loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest based, at Opco s election, on (a) SOFR plus an applicable margin or (b) the base rate plus an applicable margin. Until delivery of a compliance certificate in respect of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, the applicable margin for SOFR loans is 4.25 and the applicable margin for base rate loans is 3.25 . Thereafter, the applicable margin can range from 3.75 to 4.25 for SOFR loans and from 2.75 to 3.25 for base rate loans, in each case depending on Opco s first lien net leverage ratio, as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Upon the closing of the Omni Acquisition, Opco assumed the Escrow Loan Borrower s obligations under the Credit Agreement, which were further secured by certain guarantors. Opco s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by us and each of Opco s existing and future domestic subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions). 
 
 On January 25, 2024, the date of the Omni Acquisition, both GN Bondco, LLC and GN Loanco, LLC ceased operations and their debt and related funds were transferred to Opco, a consolidated subsidiary of us.

Table of Contents 

On February 12, 2024, Opco and the parties to the Credit Agreement entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, which (a) modifies the financial performance covenant in the Credit Agreement by temporarily increasing the 4.50:1.00 maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio permitted by the covenant to (i) 6.00:1.00 (for the second and third quarters of 2024), (ii) 5.50:1.00 (for the fourth quarter of 2024), (iii) 5.25:1.00 (for the first quarter of 2025), (iv) 5.00:1.00 (for the second quarter of 2025) and (v) 4.75:1.00 (for the third quarter of 2025) and (b) reduces the revolving credit commitments available under the Credit Agreement from an aggregate principal amount of 400,000 to an aggregate principal amount of 340,000. Amendment No. 2 also amends certain other terms of the Credit Agreement in connection with the foregoing. Prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 2 on February 12, 2024, Opco repaid 80,000 aggregate principal amount of the New Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. 
 
 Both the Notes and Revolving Credit Facility contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of us, without the approval of the required lenders, to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, asset sales, dividends and stock repurchases, investments, and other transactions or to incur liens or indebtedness in excess of agreed thresholds, as set forth in the credit agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility s terms also include a financial covenant which requires us to maintain a specific leverage ratio. As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with all aforementioned covenants. 
 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 
 In connection with the Omni Acquisition, we, Opco, Omni Holders and certain other parties entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which sets forth the agreement among the parties regarding the sharing of certain tax benefits realized by us as a result of the Omni Acquisition. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are generally obligated to pay certain Omni Holders 83.5 of (a) the total tax benefit that we realize as a result of increases in tax basis in Opco s assets resulting from certain actual or deemed distributions and the future exchange of units of Opco for shares of securities of us (or cash) pursuant to Opco s operating agreement that became effective as of the Closing, (b) certain pre-existing tax attributes of certain Omni Holders that are corporate entities for tax purposes, (c) the tax benefits that we realize from certain tax allocations that correspond to items of income or gain required to be recognized by certain Omni Holders, and (d) other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement rank pari passu with all unsecured obligations but senior to any future tax receivable or similar agreement entered into by us. 
 
 The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early (or it is terminated early due to a change of control or insolvency event with respect to us or a material breach by us of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement). 
 
 Upon such an early termination, we will be required to make a payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future payments to be made by it under the Tax Receivable Agreement (based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement). In the event of a change of control, under certain circumstances, we may elect to pay the early termination payment over a period of 15 years, with the payments increased to reflect the time value of money. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Continuing Operations 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was 45,770 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 142,120 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the change in net income from operations after consideration of non-cash items and the increase in accounts receivable and other current and noncurrent assets, partially offset by the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 1,592,878 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 75,508 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 were 29,810, which primarily related to the purchase of technology and operating equipment. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2023 were 22,080, which also primarily related to the purchase of technology and operating equipment. Investing activities of continuing operations for the first nine months of 2024 included the Omni Acquisition for a preliminary purchase price of 2,313,653, of which 1,565,242 was cash consideration and the remainder non-cash equity shares. Further, investing activities for the first nine months of 2023 included the acquisition of Land Air for a preliminary purchase price of 56,567.

 Discontinued Operation 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operation was 6,013 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations of 17,311 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operation was primarily related to a decrease in net income of discontinued operation after consideration of non-cash items. The sale of Final Mile was completed on December 20, 2023. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operation was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,338 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operation was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15,973 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 883 shares of our common stock for approximately 93,811, through open market transactions. All shares received were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over the par value per share was recorded to Retained (Deficit) Earnings in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Item 3 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. As of the first quarter of 2024, there were no material changes in our exposure to market risk. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain controls and procedures designed to ensure that we are able to collect the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file with the SEC, and to process, summarize and disclose this information within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report conducted by management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe that these controls and procedures are effective to ensure that we are able to collect, process and disclose the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file with the SEC within the required time periods. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to the Omni Acquisition, we have begun integration and controls assessment activities. In accordance with the SEC s published guidance, because we acquired these operations during the fiscal year, we plan to exclude these operations from our efforts to comply with Section 404 Rules for fiscal 2024.

Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 On September 26, 2023, Rodney Bell, Michael A. Roberts and Theresa Woods, (collectively, the "Plaintiffs"), three of our shareholders, filed a complaint against us and certain of its directors and officers in the Third District Chancery Court sitting in Greeneville, Tennessee (the "Shareholder Complaint"). The Shareholder Complaint alleges, among other things, that our shareholders have the right to vote on certain transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and sought an injunction against the consummation of the transaction until a shareholder vote was held. The court initially granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement but later dissolved it on October 25, 2023. Thereafter and as described below, on the Closing, the parties to the Amended Merger Agreement completed the Omni Acquisition. On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff Michael Roberts, together with the Cambria County Employees Retirement System filed a stipulation and proposed order seeking leave of court to file an amended class action complaint seeking damages, among other forms of relief. Upon receiving leave of the court, on May 15, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed the amended complaint. Like the earlier complaints, it challenges our determination not to subject the Omni Acquisition to a shareholder vote. We disagree with the allegations of the amended complaint and are in the process of defending the matter. 
 
 The Company is party to various legal claims and actions incidental to its business, including claims related to vehicle liability, workers compensation, property damage and employee medical benefits. The Company accrues for the uninsured portion of contingent losses from these and other pending claims when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on the knowledge of the facts, the Company believes the resolution of claims and pending litigation, taking into account existing reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the Company s view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold. For information regarding our insurance program and legal proceedings, see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) set forth in Part 1 of this report. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 The Company did not repurchase any of its equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 
 Not applicable. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 
 Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information. 
 
 Shareholder Proposals for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
 
 Our proxy statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 20, 2024, contained an inconsistency solely related to the dates by which a shareholder must submit a shareholder proposal for consideration at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, but which is not being considered for inclusion in the related proxy statement. In particular, in the case of the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, director nominations can be submitted by shareholders in accordance with the provisions of our Bylaws no earlier than February 3, 2025 and the deadline to submit nominations is March 5, 2025. Accordingly, the Company is hereby confirming the following with respect to shareholder proposals for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders: 

59 

Table of Contents 

Shareholder Proposals for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
 
 Any proposal intended to be presented for action at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders by any shareholder of the Company must be received by the Secretary of the Company at its principal executive offices not later than February 3, 2025 in order for such proposal to be considered for inclusion in the Company s Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to its 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to require the Company to include any shareholder proposal which does not meet all the requirements for such inclusion established by Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. 
 
 Any shareholder proposal must also meet all other requirements contained in our Bylaws, including the advance notice provisions. For other shareholder proposals (including director nominations) to be timely (but not considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders), a shareholder s notice must be received by the Secretary of the Company between February 3, 2025 and March 5, 2025 and the proposal and the shareholder must comply with Rule 14a-4 under the Exchange Act. In the event that a shareholder proposal intended to be presented for action at the next annual meeting does not comply with the aforementioned requirements, the shareholder proposal will be excluded from the annual meeting. 
 
 Any shareholder proposal must also meet all other requirements contained in our Bylaws. 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
