As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not entered into any material leases that have not yet commenced. The Company adopted ASC 326 on July 1, 2023 .

The impact of the reserve for unfunded liabilities to the consolidated financial statements was not material.

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . This standard eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. For public business entities, these amendments require that an entity disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Gross charge-off information must be included in the vintage disclosures required for public business entities in accordance with paragraph 326-20-50-6, which requires that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. ASU No. 2022-02 was effective for the Company on July 1, 2023. ASU No. 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures. The FASB issued ASU 2023-02 using the Proportional Amortization Method. The amendments in this update permit exporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. A reporting entity may make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis rather than electing to apply the proportional amortization method at the reporting entity level or to individual investments. The amendments in this update also remove certain guidance for Qualified Affordable Housing Project investments and require the application of the delayed equity contribution guidance to all tax equity investments.

Accordingly, the Company recognizes amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair value. At June 30, 2024, the Company finalized its review of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and did not record any further adjustments to the carrying value. The fair value of retail demand and interest-bearing deposit accounts was assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand. The fair value of time deposits was estimated by discounting the contractual future cash flows using market rates offered for time deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of borrowings was based on the FHLB calculation to prepay borrowings with associated penalties.

The Company engages primarily in the lending of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans. Lending activities are targeted to individuals within the Company's geographic footprint. Risks associated with lending activities include economic conditions and changes in interest rates, which can adversely impact both the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the associated collateral. Credit risk exposure is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and conservative underwriting standards that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than for commercial loans, for multifamily loans and for residential loans. Residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan-to-value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance. The real estate home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable-rate home equity lines of credit. Risks associated with second lien loans secured by residential properties are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market.

At June 30, 2024, total unfunded loan related commitments, including lines of credit, amounted to million , comprised of million for unused equity lines of credit and million to originate and purchase loans, expiring within . Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. A reserve for unfunded commitments is recognized and included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Periodic adjustm ents to either increase or decrease the reserve are recognized in non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. The Company recorded and expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The balance for unfunded commitments was at September 30, 2024 and at June 30, 2024 . 

 , comprised of common equity Tier I capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements and must be maintained to avoid limitations on capital distributions. In 2021, the Bank adopted the new community bank leverage ratio framework. This framework simplifies the regulatory capital requirements by requiring the Bank to meet only the Tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage) ratio. The Bank must only maintain a leverage ratio greater than the required minimum to be considered well capitalized under this framework. The Bank can opt out of the new framework and return to the risk-weighting framework at any time. Market risk, credit risk, operational risk and deposit outflows are some of the factors that can impact the capital adequacy ratio and in turn, adversely affect the performance of the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. As of September 30, 2024 , the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum ratios as set forth in the following tables. There are no conditions or events since that notification that

Fair Value of Financial Instruments not Carried at Fair Value The Company discloses fair value information about financial assets, whether or not recognized in the statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The fair value of financial assets that are not measured at fair value in the financial statements were based on the exit price notion. The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, the estimates below are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could be realized in the marketplace. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Loans The fair values of performing loans was estimated by segregating the portfolio into its primary loan categories owner occupied commercial real estate, other commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and industrial, residential and consumer. These categories were further disaggregated based upon significant financial characteristics such as type of interest rate (fixed/variable). The Company discounts the contractual cash flows for each loan category using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar quality and incorporates estimates of future loan prepayments. Deposits The fair value of deposits with no defined maturities (e.g. demand deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts) is the amount payable on demand of the liabilities at the reporting date (i.e. their carrying amounts). This approach to estimating fair value excludes the significant benefit that results from the low -cost funding provided by such deposit liabilities, as compared to alternative sources of funding. Deposits with stated maturities (time deposits) have been valued using the present value of cash flows discounted at rates approximating the current market for similar deposits. Borrowed Funds The fair value of federal funds purchased is equal to the amount borrowed. The fair value of FRB-NY advances represents contractual repayments discounted using interest rates currently available for borrowings with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. The discount rates used are representative of approximate rates currently offered on borrowings with similar characteristics and maturities.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following management discussion and analysis of the Company s consolidated financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 MD A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements, including notes thereto, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the other information therein. The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024, the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are unaudited. The Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of June 30, 2024 was derived from the audited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition that was included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. The consolidated financial statements include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of such data. As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we, us, our, the Bank and the Company refer to SR Bancorp, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, continue, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and 

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report. 
 The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 
 general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected, including potential recessionary conditions; 

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we have made and make; 

our ability to integrate the operations of Regal Bank into Somerset Regal Bank in a timely and cost efficient manner; 

our inability to successfully integrate acquired employees or operations or achieve the expected level of synergies or cost savings; 

changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of and the methodology calculating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; 

our ability to access cost-effective funding; 

27 

changes in liquidity, including the size and composition of our deposit portfolio and the percentage of uninsured deposits in the portfolio; 

fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; 

demand for loans and deposits in our market area; 

our ability to implement and change our business strategy; 

competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets; 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums or changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of the U.S. Treasury or Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; 

changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; 

technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; 

the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; 

a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; 

our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical event; 

our ability to retain key employees; 

our compensation expense associated with equity allocated or awarded to our employees; and 

changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 

Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Certain of our accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. 
 The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we plan to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 Management believes our most critical accounting policies, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, are as follows: the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the assessment of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and the valuation of our deferred tax assets. 
 28 

Allowance for Credit Losses : The allowance for credit losses ACL ), calculated in accordance with ASC 326, is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans. The ACL represents an amount that, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb the lifetime expected credit losses that may be experienced on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions and prepayment experience. The allowance for credit losses is measured and recorded upon the initial recognition of a financial asset. Determination of the adequacy of the allowance is inherently complex and requires the use of significant and highly subjective estimates. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. 
 In calculating the allowance for credit losses, loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. Common characteristics and risk profiles include the type of loan, underlying collateral, geographical similarity and historical or expected credit loss patterns. The Company applies two methodologies to estimate the allowance on its pooled portfolio segments: a cohort method based on common characteristics and the weighted average remaining life method. The models related to these methodologies utilize the Company s historical default and loss experience adjusted for future economic forecasts. The reasonable and supportable forecast period represents a one-year economic outlook for the applicable economic variables. 
 In some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics that differentiate the loan from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing, among other things, the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk rating of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower. 
 Management qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease management s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making qualitative factor adjustments include, among other things: the impact of changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries; actual and expected changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the loan pools; changes in the composition and size of the loan portfolio and in the terms of the underlying loans; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of our lending management and staff; changes in volume and severity of past due and nonaccrual assets; changes to the quality of our internal loan review system; the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit; and regulatory, legal and environmental events. Management believes it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established the existing allowance in accordance with GAAP. However, the determination of the allowance requires significant judgment, and estimates of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize expected losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions, changes to the interest rate environment and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets : Our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. The initial recording of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual tests for impairment, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment as a part of the annual impairment test. If the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, then we would be required to perform a quantitative test for goodwill impairment. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit less than the carrying value, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value. 
 During the year ended June 30, 2024, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill. Based on that assessment, we determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value was not less than its carrying amount. We concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, no triggering events were identified and therefore, we did not perform an interim impairment evaluation. 
 29 

Core deposit intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis using an estimated life of ten years. The core deposit intangibles are evaluated annually for impairment in accordance with GAAP. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not considered recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. 
 Income Taxes : Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
 The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. 
 We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in other operating expenses. 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 Total Assets . Total assets increased 32.1 million, or 3.1 , to 1.05 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.02 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by new loan originations, resulting in a net increase of 35.9 million in loans receivable. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased 1.4 million, or 3.0 , to 47.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 45.9 million at June 30, 2024 due to the increases in deposits and borrowings. 
 Securities . Securities held-to-maturity decreased 3.6 million, or 2.3 , to 152.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 156.1 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to principal repayments and maturities. 
 Loans . Loans receivable, net, increased 35.9 million, or 4.9 , to 767.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 731.9 million at June 30, 2024, primarily due to a 25.6 million, or 14.2 , increase in multi-family loans and a 11.5 million, or 2.9 , increase in residential mortgage loans. Commercial loans (consisting of multi-family and commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans) accounted for 45.8 of loans at September 30, 2024. For further information about our loans, see "Lending Activities" below. 
 Bank Owned Life Insurance . Bank owned life insurance increased 260,000, or 0.7 , to 37.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 37.1 million at June 30, 2024. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets . Goodwill and the core deposit intangible asset recognized from the Merger totaled 27.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 28.1 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was due to the amortization of the core deposit intangible. 
 Total Liabilities . Total liabilities increased 31.1 million, or 3.8 , to 852.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 821.4 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a 20.0 million advance borrowing with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and a 12.7 million increase in deposits. 
 30 

Deposits . Deposits increased 12.3 million, or 1.5 , to 819.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 807.1 million at June 30, 2024 due primarily to increases in interest-bearing checking accounts that offset decreases in non-maturity savings accounts due in part to the Bank having raised rates on certain interest-bearing deposit products in an effort to remain competitive in the market area. At September 30, 2024, 102.5 million, or 12.5 , of total deposits consisted of noninterest-bearing deposits. At September 30, 2024, 137.6 million, or 16.8 , of total deposits were uninsured. 
 Borrowings . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank borrowed 20.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York to provide for additional liquidity in order to fund new loans. Such borrowing remained outstanding at September 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings. 
 Total Equity . Total equity increased 1.1 million, or 0.5 , to 200.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 199.5 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to net earnings of 1.4 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of the Company's pension plan of 337,000, or 27.7 , partially offset by a decrease of 737,000 due to the repurchase of 66,288 shares of Company common stock. 
 Lending Activities 
 We offer a variety of loans, including residential, commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Historically, we have had a significant portion of our loan portfolio concentrated in residential loans, including one- to four-family residential loans. The Merger greatly expanded our commercial loan portfolio and commercial lending capabilities. At September 30, 2024, residential mortgage loans comprised 52.7 of our total loan portfolio and commercial loans comprised 45.8 , which largely consisted of multi-family loans. 
 In the future, we intend to continue to concentrate on ways to compete for a greater share of commercial loan originations in our primary market area.

Non-Performing and Problem Assets 
 When a loan is 15 days past due, we send the borrower a late charge notice. If the loan delinquency is not corrected, other forms of collections are implemented, including telephone calls and collection letters. We attempt personal, direct contact with the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency, to ensure that the borrower understands the terms of the loan and to emphasize the importance of making timely payments. If necessary, subsequent late charges and delinquency notices are issued and the account will be monitored on a regular basis thereafter. By the 90 th day of delinquency, we will send the borrower a final demand for payment, after which we may refer the loan to legal counsel to commence foreclosure proceedings. Any of our loan officers can shorten these time frames in consultation with the senior lending officer. 
 Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status when payment of principal or interest is 90 days or more delinquent unless the loan is considered well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans are also placed on non-accrual status if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt. When loans are placed on a non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received. The loan may be returned to accrual status if both principal and interest payments are brought current and factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, including performance by the borrower under the loan terms for a six-month period. Our Senior Mortgage Lending Officer reports monitored loans, including all loans rated special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss, to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. In addition, management presents a quarterly credit loss allowance analysis to our Board of Directors.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Our allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is maintained at a level necessary to absorb credit losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for credit losses, considers the losses in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for credit losses is set forth in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of SR Bancorp Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Credit Losses in our Form 10-K as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was maintained at levels that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. However, this analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment. 
 In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance have authority to periodically review our allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for credit losses for the years indicated.

Investment Activities 
 General . The goals of our investment policy are to maximize portfolio yield over the long term in a manner that is consistent with minimizing risk, and meeting liquidity needs, pledging requirements, and asset/liability management and interest rate risk strategies. Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we will increase the balance of our investment securities portfolio when we have excess liquidity. 
 At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted solely of securities held-to-maturity, primarily of securities and obligations issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, subordinated debentures issued by financial institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region, collateralized mortgage obligations and foreign government bonds. 
 The amortized cost and approximate fair values of securities held-to-maturity at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 are as follows:

For additional information regarding our investment securities portfolio, see Note 4 to the Notes to Financial Statements. 
 Deposit Accounts . Deposits are primarily attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW accounts), savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we also held 34.5 million and 22.2 million, respectively, of accounts from a variety of local municipal relationships. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had no brokered deposits. 
 We also offer a variety of deposit accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area. Our business banking deposit products include a business checking account designed for small businesses, savings and money market accounts. We offer bill payment services through our online banking system. 
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, the rates on borrowings, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products, and to periodically offer special rates to attract deposits of a specific type or term. 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits by account type at the dates indicated.

As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposits (deposits in amounts greater than 250,000, which is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance), was 137.6 million and 109.7 million, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of all our uninsured certificates of deposit was 24.0 million and 21.9 million, respectively. We have no deposits that are uninsured for any reason other than being in excess of the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance.

Comparison of Operating Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General. Net income increased 11.9 million to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a net loss of 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.0 million of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments resulting from the Merger. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 3.9 million of merger-related costs, a 4.2 million provision for credit losses related to the Merger and a 5.4 million charitable contribution, offset by 161,000 of net accretion income related to the fair value adjustments. Excluding these items, net income would have been 586,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 5.9 million, or 106.9 , to 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 163 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets and a 343.2 million increase in the average balance of loans. The increase resulted from a 6.5 million, or 173.9 , increase in interest income on loans due to the increased size of the loan portfolio as a result of the Merger as well as a higher average yield on the loan portfolio due to higher market rates and an increased proportion of higher-yielding commercial real estate loans, offset by a 197,000 decrease in interest income on securities, and a 410,000 decrease in interest income from other interest-earnings assets. The decrease in interest income on securities was due to a 48.8 million decrease in the average balance of securities resulting primarily from the sale of 35.4 million of lower-yielding securities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 as part of a balance sheet repositioning. The decrease in interest income from other interest-earning assets was due to a decrease in the average balance of those assets of 36.9 million, or 44.1 , which were used primarily to originate new loans. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 2.5 million or 177.0 , to 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 2.6 million increase in interest expense on deposits, offset in part by a 77,000 decrease in interest expense on borrowings. The decrease in interest expense was due to a 20.0 million borrowing with the Federal Home Loan Bank being outstanding for only a portion of the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 20.0 million Federal Reserve advance being outstanding for the full three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by a higher rate on the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing. Interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits increased 879,000 due to an increase of 132.9 million in the average balance and an increase of 123 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.13 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on certificates of deposit increased 1.7 million as the average rate on certificates of deposit increased 152 basis points to 3.99 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.47 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the highly competitive interest rate environment in our market area. The average balance of certificates of deposit also increased 100.9 million, or 57.3 , to 276.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 176.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 39 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 3.4 million, or 83.2 , to 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest rate spread increased 58 basis points to 2.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin increased 80 basis points to 3.21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest-earning assets increased 41.8 million, or 23.0 , to 223.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 181.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in the Bank s net interest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily a result of the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing at a slower rate than the yield on interest-earning assets. 
 Average Balances and Yields 
 The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Deferred loan fees totaled 67,000 and 24,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following tables present the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of these tables, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the tables below.

Provision for Credit Losses. We establish provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, we consider, among other things, loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current and reasonably supportable economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of delinquent loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. We assess the allowance for credit losses and make provisions for credit losses on a monthly basis. 
 The Bank recorded a recovery for credit losses of 154,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a provision for credit losses of 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a full reserve was required to be established on the Regal Bank loan portfolio in connection with the Merger. The recovery reflects updates made to model assumptions in the calculation of the Bank's allowance for credit losses to reflect the change in the loan composition following the Merger. The Bank had no charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 9,000 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 compared to no charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 144,000 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2023. The Bank s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.66 at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.77 at September 30, 2023.

 Income Tax Expense. The provision for income taxes was 363,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a tax benefit of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Bank s effective tax rate was 21.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, reflecting lower state income tax liabilities due to the application of net operating loss carryforwards and a lower state income tax rate applied to the net investment income derived by Somerset Regal Bank s investment company subsidiary.

Market Risk 
 General . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our ALCO/Investment Committee, which consists of members of management, is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates. 
 We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: 
 growing transaction deposit accounts; 

rebalancing our loan portfolio through the Merger to include higher-yielding, shorter-term commercial real estate loans; 

utilizing our investment securities portfolio as part of our balance sheet asset and liability and interest rate risk management strategy to reduce the impact of movements in interest rates on net interest income and economic value of equity, which can create temporary valuation adjustments to equity in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income; and 

continuing to price our one-to-four family residential real estate loan products in a way that encourages borrowers to select our adjustable-rate loans as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate loans. 

By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to changes in market interest rates. 
 We generally do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures or options, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. 
 Economic Value of Equity . We compute amounts by which the net present value of our cash flow from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items (economic value of equity EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. We measure potential change in our EVE through the use of a financial model. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. Historically, the model estimated the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumption that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by 100 to 300 basis points in 100 basis point increments. However, given the current level of market interest rates, an EVE calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100-basis point increase in the Basis Point Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 43 

The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, we would have experienced an 8.21 decrease in NII in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and an 6.64 decrease in NII in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The above table assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and will differ from actual results. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is the ability to fund assets and meet obligations as they come due. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, and repayments from investment securities. In addition, we have the ability to borrow in the wholesale markets or from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. While maturities and 
 44 

scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We seek to maintain a ratio of liquid assets (including cash and federal funds sold) as a percentage of total deposits ranging between 4 and 30 . At September 30, 2024, this ratio was 5.8 We believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024. 
 We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: 
 (i) expected loan demand; 

(ii) expected deposit flows; 

(iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and 

(iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. 

Excess cash is invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities. 
 Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 47.3 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 64.2 million in outstanding loan commitments and 36.1 million of unused lines of credit. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 245.7 million, or 88.4 , of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including loan sales, other deposit products, including replacement certificates of deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) or advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and other borrowing sources. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or after September 30, 2024. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 
 Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our primary investing activities are originating and purchasing loans and purchasing mortgage-backed securities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 37.7 million of loans and purchased 14.2 million. We had no purchases of securities classified as held-to-maturity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts. Deposits increased 12.3 million, or 1.5 , to 819.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 807.1 million at June 30, 2024 due primarily to increases in interest-bearing checking accounts that offset decreases in non-maturity savings accounts due in part to the Bank having raised rates on certain interest-bearing deposit products in an effort to remain competitive in the market area. 
 We had outstanding borrowings of 20.0 million as of September 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings. 
 Somerset Regal Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At September 30, 2024, Somerset Regal Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Somerset Regal Bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 45 

The net proceeds from the offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of loans. Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the offering, resulting in increased net interest-earning assets and net interest income. However, due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the offering, our return on equity will be adversely affected following the offering until such excess funds can be deployed. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 Our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than the effects of inflation.
