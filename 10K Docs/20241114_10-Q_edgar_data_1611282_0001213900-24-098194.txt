shares of common stock in the Company. At the option of any shareholder,
shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, may be issued in lieu of shares of common stock. Upon the closing of the Merger, PishPosh,
Inc. became the surviving corporation. 

The
Company has a wide array of baby products, including brand-name strollers, car seats and other baby gear accessories, which are
sold via its retail location, website and other e-commerce channels. The Company s headquarters are in Lakewood, New Jersey. 

and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has negative cash flows from operations for the
nine months then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is dependent upon
its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date,
and/or to obtain additional debt or equity financing. Through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has been
primarily financed through the issuance of loans and proceeds from the sale of preferred and common stock. In the event that the Company
cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations, the Company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the
sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders. If the Company
is unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, the
Company would be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material,
adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful
in these efforts. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company is seeking to raise capital via an equity offering and filed an amended Form S-1 on August 30, 2024. In the event the Company
does not complete an offering, the Company expects to seek additional funding through private equity or debt financings. The Company
may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all.

deferred offering costs, of which pertain to costs incurred from 2021 through 2023 when the Company initiated its
public offering efforts. These costs include legal fees and accounting fees related to the Company s previous audits. Management
believes that these costs should not be impaired as of September 30, 2024 as they still provide economic benefits for the Company s
potential public offering. All initial offering costs incurred have enabled the Company to achieve and maintain SEC effectiveness, which
is a key component of the Company s ability to undergo a successful initial public offering. The Company filed an amended Form
S-1 on August 30, 2024. Management will continue to monitor any further delay or abandonment of the contemplated public offering. If
any further delays are expected, the Company may have to impair a substantial portion, or all, of its deferred offering costs.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
condensed financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial
statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or SEC on March 28, 2024. 

Some
of the statements contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information
with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We have based these
forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. The following information and any forward-looking
statements should be considered in light of factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly including
those risks identified in Part II-Item 1A Risk Factors and our other filings with the SEC. 

Our
actual results and timing of certain events may differ materially from the results discussed, projected, anticipated, or indicated in
any forward-looking statements. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our
actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially
from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements made herein are as
of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q with the SEC and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.
Even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent
with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, they may not be predictive of
results or developments in future periods. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the
SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances
on which any such statements may be based or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements. 

Overview
of Operations 

We
are primarily a baby gear distributor based in Lakewood, New Jersey. We showcase and sell our products through our showroom and our website, www.pishposhbaby.com ,
third party marketplaces like Amazon.com and our boutique (on site). We also showcase and sell our baby gear products directly to consumers
in our retail showroom in Lakewood, New Jersey. We focus on providing our consumers with high value content and education on brands of
baby gear we believe to be of high quality. We have a team of Mom reps to assist consumers in our showroom, online and over the telephone.
Our Mom reps are educated consumer advocates who we believe offer real value by helping guide customers, especially new moms to be, who
may be very overwhelmed by the pregnancy experience, in a non-judgmental, friendly, and professional manner. 

Although
approximately 85 of our current sales are from strollers, stroller accessories and car seats, we also offer a variety of products including
baby carriers, diaper bags, feeding and safety accessories and bouncers. We do not have our own fulfilment operations. We outsource our
order fulfilment operations to a 35,000 square foot warehouse fulfilment center which we believe improves customer service and shortens
the delivery time compared with those e-commerce retailers that do not hold any inventory. Outsourcing also lowers shipping costs as
compared to drop shipping. We offer next day delivery via FedEx, UPS USPS in the New York Tri-State area and free shipping on orders
over 75. We currently maintain approximately 1.8 million of inventory, consisting of strollers, car seats and highchairs, with a 60
 90-day turnover. With respect to items of which we sell less, we take customer orders before we purchase inventory from our vendors
and then drop ship to the customer directly from the manufacturer thereby reducing our inventory risk on such items. 

According
to Market Watch, new mothers represent 16 billion in combined consumer purchasing power. We focus on offering baby gear for the mid
to higher income demographics, specifically those with annual income of 75,000 and more. Currently, our average order is 200 
 300. However, since we believe that the average spending by expectant parents is around 4,000, we hope to be able to generate additional
sales by offering additional products. 

19 

Our
strategy is built upon: 

The
 Company drives engagement using celebrity micro influencers via social media coupled with extensive data-collection and analytic
 capabilities to provide a personalized shopping experience that anticipates customer preferences and results in repeat purchases
 over long periods of time. 

PishPosh
 is a valued partner to its vendors because of its large and highly engaged consumer audience, providing significant brand exposure
 and ongoing revenue opportunities. 

The
 Company has recently integrated a highly successful procurement and manufacturing team and intends to begin leveraging its recognized
 name by producing PishPosh-branded product lines to yield higher margins. 

With
additional investment to allow further scaling, the combination of its unique customer base, vendor relationships, efficient fulfilment
infrastructure, and the ability to leverage its own brand for new products will result in significant competitive advantages and sustainably
higher gross sales and net margins. 

Our
challenge is to ensure that potential customers do not use our content, education, and advice and purchase elsewhere. We currently intend
to purchase, from time to time, end of season inventory to offer lower prices to help with customer acquisition. We also intend to widen
our product line to furniture and nursery (products such as bedding and linen) in an effort to reach a broader range of consumers and
to have a larger order value and better lifetime value per consumer. We intend to increase our Mom reps to include a wider range of persons
in order to communicate with and relate to varied demographics. We believe that our Mom reps not only help increase our customer base
but also help us compete with the Big Box stores and other online retailers. The salespeople in the Big Box stores do not necessarily
consist of educated parents as our Mom reps. Online e-commerce retailers cannot provide the personal expertise that our Mom reps offer
our potential customers. 

Another
major challenge of ours is that we are subject to the terms and conditions imposed on us by our vendors. We do not have any contracts
or binding agreements to purchase inventory. Management works diligently to maintain good relationships with our vendors. 

Key
Factors Affecting our Performance 

As
a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods,
and our results of operations may not be directly comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key
factors impacting our results of operations. 

Known
Trends and Uncertainties 

Inflation 

Prices
of certain commodity products, including raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes
in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, trade restrictions
and tariffs. Increasing prices in the component materials for the goods we sell may impact the availability and the price of the products,
as vendors search for alternatives to existing materials and increase the prices they charge for the goods. Also, cost base reflects
significant elements for freight, including fuel, which has significantly increased due to the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic and Russia s initiation of military action against Ukraine. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices such as
fuel and plastic may increase the price at which we purchase goods that we sell from our vendors, and as a result, if we are unable to
pass the increased costs of raw materials on to our customers, such increased costs may negatively affect our profit margins. We have
experienced an increase in the cost of products from suppliers as well as an increase in shipping costs due to the increase in gas prices.
While product cost increases have been passed through to our customers through product price increases, the increase in shipping costs
has been absorbed by the Company, resulting in nominal impact to our profit margins. If our costs were to become subject to significant
inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs by increasing prices for our products. 

20 

Interest
Rate 

Fluctuations
in interest rates impact on the value of investments and financing activities, giving rise to interest rate risk. The debt of the Company
is comprised of different instruments, which bear interest at either fixed or floating interest rates. The ratio of fixed and floating
rate instruments in the loan portfolio is monitored and managed. All of our notes payable and capital lease obligations are fixed rate
instruments and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. A majority of the interest rates on our borrowings compare favorably
with those rates available in the market. 

The
Company policy with regards to financial assets, is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short-term
investments in order to maintain liquidity, while also achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders. 

The
impact of recent interest rate increases has increased interest incurred on our merchant advances and credit transactions, however the
impact has not been material to our operations or financial performance. 

Increasing
interest rates may affect the Company s financing activities, which could make it more difficult for the Company to secure inventory
on a timely basis and adversely impact the Company s ability to manage its accounts payable with suppliers. 

Geopolitical
Conditions 

Our
operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions, trade disputes, international boycotts and sanctions, political and social
instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or other similar events. From time to time, we could have a large number of customers located
in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a region in which we have a concentrated exposure
could negatively impact our results of operations. 

Recently,
Russia initiated significant military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed significant sanctions
and export controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political, business,
and financial organizations, and the U.S. and certain other countries could impose further sanctions, trade restrictions, and other retaliatory
actions should the conflict continue or worsen. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of the conflict, including related
geopolitical tensions, and the measures and retaliatory actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in respect thereof as well as any
counter measures or retaliatory actions by Russia or Belarus in response, including, for example, potential cyberattacks or the disruption
of energy exports, is likely to cause regional instability, geopolitical shifts, and could materially adversely affect global trade,
currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. The situation remains uncertain, and while it is difficult to predict
the impact of any of the foregoing, the conflict and actions taken in response to the conflict could increase our costs, disrupt our
supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all,
or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Seasonality 

Since
the demand for the category of products that we sell is not related to any particular season, and no seasonal pattern exists with respect
to pregnancies, our business rarely suffers a seasonal impact. 

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Net
revenues 

We
sell our products through our showroom and our website, as well as third party marketplaces like Amazon.com and our boutique (on site).
We also showcase and sell our baby gear products directly to consumers in our retail showroom in Lakewood, New Jersey. 

21 

Cost of net revenues and Gross profit and margin 

Our cost of net revenue includes the direct cost
of purchased merchandise, inventory shrinkage, inventory adjustments due to obsolescence including excess and slow-moving inventory and
lower of cost and net realizable reserves. Cost of net revenues also includes duties and inbound freight. 

Our gross profit and margin is primarily driven
by fluctuations in our product costs for purchased inventory. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of all payroll and payroll-related expenses, professional fees, insurance, software costs, merchant processing fees and expenses related
to our operations at our headquarters, including warehouse costs, including utilities, depreciation and amortization, and other costs
related to the administration of our business. 

Following the completion of our initial public
offering, we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules
and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and higher expenses for insurance, investor relations and professional services. We expect
these costs will increase our operating costs. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses include advertising
and marketing costs, including print, email marketing, digital and social media costs, public relations costs, as well as fulfilment charges,
outbound shipping to customers, and Amazon commissions. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense is incurred on the Company s
various loans and merchant advances.

Net revenues 

Net revenue was 2.5 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.5 million. Due to
the delayed public offering, the Company was unable to acquire desired inventory, which caused revenue decreases. The delayed offering
also caused the Company to delay a launch of its new product due to less marketing spend surrounding the product. 

22 

Cost of net revenues and Gross profit and margin 

Cost of net revenues was 1.8 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.7 million for the comparable three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 0.9 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues in 2024. 

Our gross profit for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 0.7 million and 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our margins, as a percentage of revenue, slightly
decreased in 2024. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 0.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.8 million three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative
expenses remained consistent, as the Company has implemented its cost cutting measures since 2023. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses were 0 in the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses were 0.7 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.2 million for the comparable three months ended September 30, 2023, a
decrease of 0.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to cost-cutting measures to decrease advertising costs in 2024. 

Sales and marketing expenses
as a percentage of revenues were 30 and 31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Interest expense was 587,093 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 194,314 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to new loans and
merchant advances entered into during 2024. For three months ended September 30, 2023, other income was recorded 410,686 due to employee
retention tax credits received. 

Net Loss 

Net loss was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30,
2024 as compared to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in loss of 0.8 million. The increase in net
loss was primarily due to an increase in interest expense in 2024 and lower gross profit.

Net revenue was 8.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4.7
million. Due to the delayed public offering, the Company was unable to acquire desired inventory, which caused revenue decreases. The
delayed offering also caused the Company to delay a launch of its new product due to less marketing spend surrounding the product.

Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Cash flows used in operating activities were 2.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by our net loss of 6.1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 2.9 million and
decreases in operating assets and liabilities of 0.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease of 0.9 million
in inventory, an increase of 0.3 million in deferred offering costs, and decrease of accounts payable 0.1 million. Cash used
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by our net loss of 9.4 million partially offset by non-cash charges
of 7.5 million and increases in operating assets and liabilities of 1.3 million driven by a decrease of 1.2 million in inventory. 

Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

We received note proceeds of 0.8 million, convertible
note payable proceeds of 0.4 million and loan proceeds of 3.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and made loan repayments
of 2.1 million.

nine months ended September 30, 2023 and made loan repayments of 1.4 million. We also received 0.7 million in related party loans and

Going Concern 

The Company has evaluated whether there are certain
conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the financial statements were issued. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have
often not generated profits since inception, has sustained net losses of 6,050,304 and 9,472,873 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has negative cash flows from operations for the years then ended. These factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date
the financial statements were available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to
meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and/or to obtain additional capital financing. Through the
date the financial statements were available to be issued, we has been primarily financed through the issuance of loans and proceeds from
the sale of preferred and common stock. In the event that we cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations, we will
need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would
result in dilution to existing shareholders. If we is unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be
obtained on terms acceptable to we, we would be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred,
which would have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given
that we will be successful in these efforts. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

The Company is seeking to raise capital via an
equity offering. In the event we do not complete an offering, we expect to seek additional funding through private equity or debt financings.
We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. 

29 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements,
as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC, that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting
Company Status 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined
in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent
to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to use this extended transition
period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until
the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended
transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with
the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We are using the extended transition period for any
other new or revised accounting standards during the period in which we remain an emerging growth company. 

We will remain an emerging growth company until
the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b)
in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least 1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th and (ii)
the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

We are also a smaller reporting company, 
meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the proposed aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us as a result
of this offering is less than 700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal
year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company after this offering if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates
is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and
the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we
cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available
to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal
years of audited financial statements in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting
companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known
trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate
our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

We are an emerging growth company as that term
is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and, as such, have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting
requirements. 

Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that
an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may, therefore, not be comparable to those of companies that comply with
such new or revised accounting standards. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have during the periods presented,
and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide
the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer) evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based
upon that evaluation, and as a result of the remediation of previously identified material weaknesses, as described below, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework
(2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting was not effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

As of September 30, 2024, our management, including
our Chairman of the Board, principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, such internal
controls and procedures were not effective. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls
over financial reporting that are considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our
management considered to be material weaknesses were: 

1. Inadequate segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives in the areas over certain user access controls; 

2. Lack of documentation of internal control
policies over IT systems and third party websites. The Company utilizes related parties credit cards to pay for inventory and other
expenses of the Company. These credit cards are used by the Company and by the related parties and thus the credit card charges are co-mingled
and susceptible to errors in accounting for Company activity. The Company should avoid utilizing related parties credit cards;
however, if this type of financing is still required, Management needs to implement internal controls to ensure all Company related credit
card charges are properly identified and recorded; and 

3. Ineffective information technology (IT) general
computing controls including lack of risk and design assessments such as IT security policies and procedures, user access, review and
assessment of IT controls within third party contracts. 

We are in the process of implementing measures
designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses. The Company s plan to
remediate the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting includes utilizing a portion of the working capital
from its initial public offering to increase staffing within its finance department sufficient to facilitate proper segregation of accounting
functions and to enable appropriate review of its internally prepared financial statements. In addition, the Company plans to retain outside
consultants, experts in, and specializing in SEC reporting for public company registrants.
