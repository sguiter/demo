 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 ): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction disclosures. The amendments allow investors to better assess, in their capital allocation decisions, how an entity s worldwide operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its income tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The other amendments in this ASU improve the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures by adding disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit) to be consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Regulation S- X 210.4 - 08 (h), Rules of General Application General Notes to Financial Statements: Income Tax Expense, and removing disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial or relevant. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is also permitted. 

million as of closing, based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on October 8, 2024, the trading day immediately preceding the closing of the merger, of . 
 
 Founded in 1934, Home Federal had branches in Minnesota and one branch in each of Iowa and Wisconsin. As of June 30, 2024, HMNF had, on a consolidated basis, billion in total assets, which included approximately million in loans and million in investment securities, as well as million in total deposits. 
 
 The transaction expanded the Company s franchise into Rochester, Minnesota and represents the largest bank acquisition in the Company s history. The Company s acquisition of Home Federal is expected to provide earnings benefit, growth potential, synergies and economies of scale arising from the combination of Home Federal with the Company. With the addition of Home Federal, based on June 30, 2024 amounts, the Company now has approximately billion in total assets, billion in total loans, billion in total deposits, and billion in assets under administration/management, with locations across the Midwest, as well as Arizona. 
 
 The Company is in the process of determining the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, and, therefore, no estimated fair value adjustments are available as of October 31, 2024 . 
 
 As a result of the transaction, stockholders of HMNF received shares of the Company s common stock for each share of HMNF common stock, resulting in the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock. The merger was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for HMNF s stockholders. Following the transaction, former stockholders of HMNF now hold approximately of the Company s outstanding common stock. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company incurred million and million, respectively, in pre-tax acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of HMNF, comprised of legal and professional fees included in professional fees and assessments expense in the consolidated statements of income. 

million. There were trading securities as of December 31, 2023 . Changes in fair value of trading securities are recorded in other noninterest income on the Company s consolidated statements of income. These securities are held in a rabbi trust account and invested in mutual funds. The trading securities will be used for future payments associated with the Company s deferred compensation plan for eligible employees, executives, and directors. 
 
 The following tables present amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, allowance for credit losses, or ACL, and fair value of the available-for-sale, or AFS, investment securities and the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair value of held-to-maturity, or HTM, securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 :

The adequacy of the ACL on investment securities is assessed at the end of each quarter. The Company does not believe that the AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 represented a credit loss impairment. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as risk free, and have a long history of zero credit loss. Additionally, there were corporate bonds in gross unrealized loss positions as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ; however, all such bonds had an investment grade rating as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Total gross unrealized losses were attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. The Company does not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 
 
 The ACL on HTM debt securities is estimated using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Using a probability of default and loss given default analysis, the ACL on HTM debt securities was thousand and thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The change in the ACL on HTM debt securities was due to a change in the provision for credit losses, with charge-offs or recoveries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities is recorded in accrued interest receivable and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 , the accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities totaled million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 , the accrued interest receivable on AFS investment securities and HTM investment securities totaled million and million, respectively. 
 
 The Company had no sales or calls of AFS investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 The Company had no sales of HTM investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 The following tables present investment securities with gross unrealized losses, for which an ACL was not recorded at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous loss position:

 Commercial 
 Asset backed securities 
 Corporate bonds 
 Total available-for-sale investment securities 

Mortgage backed securities 
 Residential agency 
 Commercial 
 Asset backed securities 
 Corporate bonds 
 Total available-for-sale investment securities 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , none of the Company s HTM debt securities were past due or on nonaccrual status. The Company did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual HTM debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of HTM investment securities and the amortized cost and fair value of AFS investment securities as of September 30, 2024 , by contractual maturity: 

Due after one year through five years 
 Due after five years through ten years

 Total investment securities 

Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 
 
 Investment securities with a total carrying value of million and million were pledged as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the carrying value of the Company s Federal Reserve stock and Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or FHLB, stock was as follows: 

FHLB 

These securities can only be redeemed or sold at their par value and only to the respective issuing institution or to another member institution. The Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component of other assets and periodically evaluates these securities for impairment. Management considers these non-marketable equity securities to be long-term investments. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. 
 
 Visa Class B Restricted Shares 
 
 In 2008, the Company received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa s initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A common shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which will be indemnified by Visa members, including the Company. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account be insufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank s Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. As of September 30, 2024 , the conversion ratio was . Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the outcome of the Visa litigation mentioned above, the Class B shares Class A equivalents) that the Company owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , were carried at a zero cost basis.

 Accrued interest receivable on loans is recorded within accrued interest receivable, and totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The Company manages its loan portfolio proactively to effectively identify problem credits and assess trends early, implement effective work-out strategies, and take charge-offs as promptly as practical. In addition, the Company continuously reassesses its underwriting standards in response to credit risk posed by changes in economic conditions. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through the following governance structure: 
 
 The Credit Risk team, Collection and Special Assets team and the Credit Governance Committee, which is an internal management committee comprised of various executives and senior managers across business lines, including Accounting and Finance, Credit Underwriting, Collections and Special Assets, Risk, and Commercial and Retail Banking, oversee the Company s systems and procedures to monitor the credit quality of its loan portfolio, conduct a loan review program, and maintain the integrity of the loan rating system. 

The Loan Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all credit requests that exceed individual limits that have not been countersigned by an individual with sufficient assigned authority. This committee has full authority to commit the Bank to any request that fits within its assigned approval authority. 

The adequacy of the ACL is overseen by the ACL Governance Committee, which is an internal management committee comprised of various Company executives and senior managers across business lines, including Accounting and Finance, Credit Underwriting, Collections and Special Assets, Risk, and Commercial and Retail Banking. The ACL Governance Committee supports the oversight efforts of the Board of Directors. 

The Board of Directors has approval authority and responsibility for all matters regarding loan policy, reviews all loans approved or declined by the Loan Committee, approves lending authority and monitors asset quality and concentration levels. 

The ACL Governance Committee and Bank Board of Directors has approval authority and oversight responsibility for the ACL adequacy and methodology. 

Loans with a carrying value of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.

1 The difference in the credit loss expense reported herein compared to the consolidated statements of income is associated with the credit loss expense of thousand related to off-balance sheet credit exposure and thousand related to HTM investment securities. 

The ACL on loans at September 30, 2024 was million, an increase of million, or , from December 31, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the provision for credit losses on construction, land and development loans. This increase was primarily due to organic loan growth and an increased reserve related to an individually evaluated construction, land and development loan. This was partially offset by a decreased ACL for commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate RRE loans. This decrease was primarily driven by a million charge-off of one commercial and industrial loan in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Credit Concentrations 
 
 The Company focuses on maintaining a well-balanced and diversified loan portfolio. Despite such efforts, it is recognized that credit concentrations may occasionally emerge as a result of economic conditions, changes in local demand, natural loan growth and runoff. To identify credit concentrations effectively, all commercial and industrial and owner occupied real estate loans are assigned Standard Industrial Classification codes, North American Industry Classification System codes and state and county codes. Property type coding is used for investment real estate. There were no industry concentrations exceeding 10 of the Company s total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of secured loans that are evaluated at origination on a centralized basis against standardized underwriting criteria. The Company generally does not risk rate consumer loans unless a default event such as bankruptcy or extended nonperformance takes place. Credit quality for the consumer loan portfolio is measured by delinquency rates, nonaccrual amounts and actual losses incurred. These loans are rated as either performing or nonperforming. 
 
 The Company assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans, except pools of homogeneous loans, and performs detailed internal and external reviews of risk rated loans over a certain threshold to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by the Company s regulators. During the internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which the borrowers operate and the estimated fair values of collateral securing the loans. These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan. 
 
 The Company s ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories. The criticized category includes special mention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings. The risk ratings are defined as follows: 
 
 Pass: A pass loan is a credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention. 

Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 

Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loss: Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.

Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans 
 
 The Company closely monitors the performance of its loan portfolio. A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when the financial condition of the borrower is deteriorating, payment in full of both principal and interest is not expected as scheduled or principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more. Exceptions may be made if the asset is secured by collateral sufficient to satisfy both the principal and accrued interest in full and collection is reasonably assured. When one loan to a borrower is placed on nonaccrual status, all other loans to the borrower are re-evaluated to determine if they should also be placed on nonaccrual status. All previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed at that time. A loan will return to accrual when collection of principal and interest is assured and the borrower has demonstrated timely payments of principal and interest for a reasonable period, generally at least six months.

Interest income that would have been recognized if loans on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , is estimated to have been million and thousand, respectively. 
 
 The Company s policy is to reverse previously recorded interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. As a result, the Company did not record any interest income on its nonaccrual loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , total accrued interest receivable on loans, which had been excluded from reported amortized cost basis on loans, was million and million, respectively, and was reported within accrued interest receivable on the consolidated statements of condition. An allowance was not carried on the accrued interest receivable at either date. 

In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulty, the Company may make certain concessions for which the terms of the loan are modified. Loans experiencing financial difficulty can include modifications for an interest rate reduction below current market rates, a forgiveness of principal balance, an extension of the loan term, an-other than significant payment delay, or some combination of similar types of modifications. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did not provide any modifications to loans under these circumstances that were experiencing financial difficulty.

 On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell its South Fargo branch in Fargo, North Dakota. At June 30, 2024, the facility included assets with a carrying value of approximately million. The sale of this facility during 2024 is likely, and the Company expects to record a gain on the sale upon closing, since the agreed upon purchase price of million is greater than the property s carrying value. The Company s West Fargo, North Dakota branch is listed for sale for million and is expected to sell within the next 12 months. At September 30, 2024, the facility included assets with a carrying value of approximately million. The Company expects to record a gain on the sale upon closing, as the expected sale price is greater than the property s carrying value. Total assets held for sale by the Company at September 30, 2024 were million and was included in other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and not included in the table above.

Servicing loans for others generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts, disbursing payments to investors and collection and foreclosure processing. Loan servicing income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes servicing fees from investors and certain charges collected from borrowers, such as late payment fees, and is net of fair value adjustments to capitalized mortgage servicing rights.

The calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company s discretion. If at lease inception the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term for the discount rate. For the Company s only finance lease, the Company utilized its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception. 

Weighted-average discount rate 
 Operating leases 

As the Company elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to separate lease and non lease components and instead to account for them as a single lease component, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance and utilities. Variable lease cost also includes payments for usage or maintenance of those capitalized equipment operating leases.

The Company establishes an ACL on unfunded commitments, except those that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the ACL on unfunded commitments was million. The ACL on unfunded commitments was presented within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client s creditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing commercial properties. 
 
 The Company was not required to perform on any financial guarantees and did not incur any losses on its commitments during the past two years. 
 
 The Company utilizes standby letters of credit issued by either the FHLB or the Bank of North Dakota to secure public unit deposits. The Company had no letters of credit outstanding with the FHLB as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . With the Bank of North Dakota, the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Letters of credit with the Bank of North Dakota were collateralized by loans pledged to the Bank of North Dakota in the amount of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 

Legal Contingencies 
 
 In the normal course of business, including in connection with business combinations pursued by the Company, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to pending and threatened litigation, claims investigations and legal and administrative cases and proceedings. Although the Company is not able to predict the outcome of such actions, after reviewing pending and threatened actions with counsel, management believes that, based on the information currently available, the outcome of such actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Reserves are established for legal claims only when losses associated with the claims are judged to be probable, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessments of litigation exposure are difficult because they involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; whether there is a potential for punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. In many lawsuits and arbitrations, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the case is close to resolution, in which case a reserve will not be recognized until that time. Assessments of class action litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation, are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, the Company may be unable to estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to every litigation matter it faces. 
 
 The Company did not have any material loss contingencies that were provided for and/or that were required to be disclosed as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

Fair value hedges: These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes of its underlying mortgage-backed investment securities and mortgage loan pools. The interest rate swaps are carried on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value in other assets (when the fair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and other liabilities (when the fair value is negative). The changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in interest income. The unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps due to changes in benchmark interest rates are recorded as an adjustment to the hedged instruments and offset in the same interest income line items. 
 
 Cash flow hedges: These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the variability of expected future cash flows due to market interest changes. The interest rate swap is carried on the Company s consolidated balance sheet at its fair value in other assets (when the fair value is positive) or in accrued expenses and other liabilities (when the fair value is negative). Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, until the cash flows of the hedged items are realized. If a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in OCI is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in OCI is reported in earnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts remain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI. The Company estimates that an additional million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense over the next 12 months. All cash flow hedges were highly effective for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024 , the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is months. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 
 Interest rate swaps: The Company periodically enters into commercial loan interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers with the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer, while simultaneously entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an institutional counterparty. 
 
 Interest rate lock commitments, forward loan sales commitments and to be announced (TBA) mortgage backed securities: The Company enters into forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage loans at specific prices and dates in order to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments.

 To-be-announced mortgage backed securities Mortgage banking 
 Total gain (loss) from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 

The Company has third party agreements that require a minimum dollar transfer amount upon a margin call. These requirements are dependent on certain specified credit measures. The amount of collateral posted with third parties was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The amount of collateral posted with third parties was deemed to be sufficient as of those dates to collateralize both the fair market value change as well as any additional amounts that may be required as a result of a change in the specified credit measures. 
 
 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 
 By using derivatives, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Company s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all swaps with each counterparty. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with institutional counterparties is remote. 
 
 The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including defaults where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. In addition, the Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, the counterparty could terminate the derivative position(s) and the Company could be required to settle its obligations under the agreements. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which included accrued interest but excluded any adjustment for non-performance risk, related to these agreements was million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has posted cash collateral of million and million, respectively. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of million and million, respectively.

The Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that it may pay without prior regulatory approval. The Company and the Bank are subject to the rules of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act rules. The rules include a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount will be subject to the limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. As of September 30, 2024 , the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer. In addition, the Company must adhere to various U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, regulatory guidelines including required minimum capital and liquidity to maintain their Federal Housing Administration approval status. Failure to comply with the HUD guidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company was in compliance with the aforementioned guidelines.

shares of its common stock subject to certain limitations and conditions. The Old Stock Repurchase Program expired on February 18, 2024. 
 
 On December 12, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program, or the New Stock Repurchase Program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to shares of its common stock subject to certain limitations and conditions. The New Stock Repurchase Program became effective on February 18, 2024, and will expire on February 18, 2027. On February 18, 2024, the New Stock Repurchase Program replaced and superseded the Old Stock Repurchase Program. 
 
 The New Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock and there is no assurance that the Company will do so. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company had not repurchased any shares under the Old Stock Repurchase Program or the New Stock Repurchase Program. The Company also repurchases shares to pay withholding taxes on the vesting of restricted stock awards and units. 

Professional standards allow entities the irrevocable option to elect to measure certain financial instruments and other items at estimated fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement on an instrument by instrument basis. The Company adopted the policy to value certain financial instruments at estimated fair value. The Company has not elected to measure any existing financial instruments at estimated fair value; however, it may elect to measure newly acquired financial instruments at estimated fair value in the future. 
 
 Recurring Basis 
 
 The Company uses estimated fair value measurements to record estimated fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine estimated fair value disclosures. 
 
 The following tables present the balances of the assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 :

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Investment Securities, Trading for Deferred Compensation 
 
 The fair value of trading securities for deferred compensation is reported using market quoted prices as such securities and underlying securities are actively traded and no valuation adjustments have been applied and therefore are classified as Level 1. 
 
 Investment Securities, Available-for-Sale 
 
 Generally, debt securities are valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, and other pricing models utilizing observable inputs and therefore are classified as Level 2. 
 
 Derivatives 
 
 All of the Company s derivatives are traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For these derivatives, estimated fair value is measured using internally developed models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and accordingly, classify as Level 2. Examples of Level 2 derivatives are basic interest rate swaps and forward contracts. 

Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Certain assets are measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at estimated fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to estimated fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment or a change in the amount of previously recognized impairment. 
 
 The estimated fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following: 

Servicing rights 

Foreclosed assets 
 Servicing rights 

Loans Held for Sale 
 
 Loans originated and held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The Company obtains quotes or bids on these loans directly from purchasing financial institutions. Typically, these quotes include a premium on the sale and thus these quotes indicate estimated fair value of the held for sale loans is greater than cost. 
 
 Impairment losses for loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value represent additional net write downs during the period to record these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, subsequent to their initial classification as loans held for sale. 
 
 The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used to measure Level 3 estimated fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , were as follows: 

Servicing rights Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed assumptions - 
 Discount rate 

Foreclosed assets Appraisal value Property specific adjustment (1) N/A N/A 
 Servicing rights Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed assumptions - 
 Discount rate 

1 There were no discounts taken on the collateral that comprises the balance of foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2023 . 

Disclosure of estimated fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that value, is required whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. In cases in which quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived estimated fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Certain financial instruments, with an estimated fair value that is not practicable to estimate and all non financial instruments, are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate estimated fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent the underlying value of the Company. 
 
 The following disclosures represent financial instruments for which the ending balances, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , were not carried at estimated fair value in their entirety on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Accrued Interest 
 
 The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate those assets and liabilities estimated fair values. 
 
 Investment Securities, Held-to-Maturity 
 
 The fair values of debt securities held-to-maturity are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities, recently executed transactions and pricing models. 

Loans 
 
 For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The estimated fair values of other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. 
 
 Bank Owned Life Insurance 
 
 Bank owned life insurance is carried at the amount due upon surrender of the policy, which is also the estimated fair value. This amount was provided by the insurance companies based on the terms of the underlying insurance contract. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 The estimated fair values of demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the consolidated balance sheet date. The estimated fair values of fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current incremental interest rates being offered on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities of the outstanding certificates of deposit. 
 
 Short Term Borrowings and Long Term Debt 
 
 For variable rate borrowings that reprice frequently, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The estimated fair values of fixed rate borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Credit Related Commitments 
 
 Off balance sheet credit related commitments are generally of short term nature. The contract amount of such commitments approximates their estimated fair value since the commitments are comprised primarily of unfunded loan commitments which are generally priced at market at the time of funding. 
 
 The estimated fair values, and related carrying or notional amounts, of the Company s financial instruments at the dates indicated were as follows: 

Investment securities held-to-maturity 
 Loans, net 
 Accrued interest receivable 
 Bank-owned life insurance 
 Financial Liabilities 
 Noninterest-bearing deposits 
 Interest-bearing deposits 
 Time deposits 
 Short-term borrowings

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported. Actual results could differ materially from our current estimates as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including (i) the ACL, including the ACL on investment securities, loans, and unfunded commitments; (ii) goodwill and intangible assets impairment; and (iii) fair value measurements. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies from those disclosed within its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the Company s critical accounting policies. 
 
 Refer to NOTE 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of accounting pronouncements issued but yet to be adopted and implemented. 
 
 The JOBS Act permits the Company an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this report, as well as any financial statements filed in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as the Company remains an emerging growth company or until the Company affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Business Combination 
 
 On October 9, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of HMNF and its wholly owned subsidiary, Home Federal Savings Bank. As a result of the transaction, HMNF merged with and into Alerus Financial Corporation, and Home Federal Savings Bank merged with and into Alerus Financial, National Association. The all-stock transaction was valued at approximately 128.8 million as of closing, based on the closing price of the Company s common stock October 8, 2024, the trading day immediately preceding the closing of the merger, of 22.90. Former stockholders of HMNF received 1.25 shares of the Company s common stock for each share of HMNF common stock, resulting in the issuance of 5,547,658 shares of the Company s common stock. The merger was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for HMNF s stockholders. Following the transaction, former stockholders of HMNF now hold approximately 21.9 of the Company s outstanding common stock. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 1.7 million and 2.3 million, respectively, in pre-tax acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of HMNF, comprised of legal and professional fees included in professional fees and assessments expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliations and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, adjusted tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, efficiency ratio, pre-provision net revenue, adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, adjusted pre-provision net revenue, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted net income, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, net interest margin (tax-equivalent), and adjusted net interest margin (tax-equivalent). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of its performance, and believes financial analysts and others frequently use these measures, and other similar measures, to evaluate capital adequacy. Management calculates: (i) tangible common equity as total common stockholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets; (ii) adjusted tangible common equity as total common stockholders equity less goodwill, other intangible assets, and cash proceeds from BTFP; (iii) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding; (iv) tangible assets as total assets, less goodwill and other intangible assets; (v) return on average tangible common equity as net income adjusted for intangible amortization net of tax, divided by average tangible common equity; (vi) efficiency ratio as noninterest expense less intangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus noninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment; (vii) pre-provision net revenue as net interest income plus noninterest income less noninterest expense; (viii) adjusted noninterest income as noninterest income less BOLI mortality proceeds less gain on sale of ESOP trustee business less net gain on sale of premises and equipment; (ix) adjusted noninterest expense as noninterest expense less HMNF merger- and acquisition-related expenses less severance and signing bonus; (x) adjusted pre-provision net revenue as net interest income plus adjusted noninterest income less adjusted noninterest expense; (xii) adjusted efficiency ratio as adjusted noninterest expense less intangible amortization expense, divided by net interest income plus adjusted noninterest income plus a tax-equivalent adjustment; (xiii) adjusted net income as net income less adjusted noninterest income items net of tax plus adjusted noninterest expense items net of tax; (xiv) adjusted return on average assets as adjusted net income divided by average total assets; (xv) adjusted return on average tangible common equity as adjusted net income adjusted for intangible amortization net of tax, divided by average tangible common equity; (xvi) adjusted net interest margin (tax equivalent) as net interest income less cash interest income and interest expense related to BTFP and less purchase accounting net accretion, adjusted for tax equivalent related to loans and securities, and adjust interest earning assets less average cash proceeds balance from BTFP and add the change in unearned purchase accounting discount; and (xvii) adjusted earnings per common share - diluted as net income adding back HMNF merger- and acquisition-related expenses adjusted for tax less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share.

Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 5.2 million, or 0.26 per diluted common share, a 4.0 million, or 43.2 , decrease compared to 9.2 million, or 0.45 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 decreased primarily due to a 5.2 million increase in noninterest expense and 1.7 million increase in provision for credit losses. This negative result was partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in net interest income. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 17.8 million, or 0.89 per diluted common share, a 8.6 million, or 32.5 , decrease compared to 26.5 million, or 1.30 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to an 8.7 million increase in noninterest expense and a 5.6 million increase in provision for credit losses. This negative result was partially offset by a 2.5 million increase in net interest income and a 1.6 million increase in noninterest income. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest income and yield related fees earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities. Net interest margin is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of interest earning assets. Net interest margin is presented on a tax-equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to a pre-tax-equivalent income, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.5 million, an increase of 2.1 million, or 10.5 , compared to 20.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a 10.2 million increase in interest income, as interest earning assets increased 486.2 million while the average interest earning asset yield increased 46 basis points. This was partially offset by the increasing cost of interest-bearing liabilities as interest expense increased 8.0 million, mainly driven by an increase of 48 basis points in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased 525.6 million. The increase in interest earning assets was primarily due to organic loan growth and increased cash balances from deposit growth and BTFP borrowings. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was due to core deposit growth, a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits and BTFP borrowings. 
 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 68.8 million, an increase of 2.5 million, or 3.7 , compared to 66.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a 34.1 million increase in interest income, as average interest earning assets increased 450.3 million while the average interest earning asset yield increased 64 basis points. This was partially offset by the increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities as interest expense increased 31.6 million, mainly driven by an increase of 89 basis points in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased 520.4 million. The increase in interest earning assets was primarily due to organic loan growth and increased cash balances from deposit growth and BTFP borrowings. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was due to core deposit growth, a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits and BTFP borrowings. 
 
 Net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.23 , compared to 2.27 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) was mainly attributable to higher earning assets at lower yields resulting from the BTFP funding as those proceeds were held at the Federal Reserve Bank. Adjusted net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) (non-GAAP), which excludes BTFP borrowings and purchase accounting accretion, was 2.35 for the third quarter of 2024, a 11 basis point increase from 2.24 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The high target federal funds interest rate continues to pressure funding costs. However, the Company anticipates that net interest income and net interest margin (on an adjusted tax equivalent basis) will increase in future periods as the impact of recent and anticipated interest rate cuts lower funding costs and fixed interest rate derivatives mature.

Table of Contents 

The following table presents average balance sheet information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields on assets, average yields earned, and rates paid for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company derived these yields and rates by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. The Company derived average balances from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated. Average loan balances include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, while interest previously accrued on these loans is reversed against interest income. In these tables, adjustments are made to the yields on tax exempt assets in order to present tax exempt income and fully taxable income on a fully taxable equivalent FTE basis.

Interest Rates and Operating Interest Differential 
 
 Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period s average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period s volume.

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to no provision for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and an increase in nonaccrual loans.

Total noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.4 million, a slight decrease of 44 thousand, or 0.2 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of 2.5 million in retirement and benefit services revenue, driven by the divestiture of the Employee Stock Ownership Program ESOP trustee business included in the three months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in a recognized gain of 2.8 million. This decrease was partially offset by a 1.4 million increase in wealth management revenue, primarily due to assets under administration/management growth as well as a 0.8 million increase in other noninterest income, primarily due to a gain on the sale of fixed assets related to the sale of the Shorewood, Minnesota branch in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities as well as increased client swap fees. 
 
 Total noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 81.1 million, a 1.6 million, or 2.0 , increase compared to 79.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase of 3.2 million in wealth management revenue due to assets under administration/management growth, primarily driven by improved equity and bond markets. Other noninterest income increased 0.4 million, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of fixed assets related to the sale of the Shorewood, Minnesota branch. This increase was partially offset by a 2.1 million decrease in retirement and benefits services, primarily driven by the divestiture of the ESOP trustee business included in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in a recognized gain of 2.8 million. 
 
 The Company anticipates that noninterest income will continue to be adversely affected in future periods if interest rates remain higher than in periods prior to the Fed's rate hikes beginning in 2022 and inflationary pressure continues. These factors have adversely affected mortgage originations and mortgage banking revenue in recent periods. The Company believes mortgage revenue will increase in future periods as a result of recent and anticipated interest rate cuts.

Total noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 42.4 million, a 5.2 million, or 13.9 , increase compared to 37.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year over year increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees and assessments, compensation, and employee taxes and benefits expenses. Professional fees and assessments increased primarily due to increased merger-related expenses of 1.7 million in connection with the acquisition of HMNF and an increase in FDIC assessments. Compensation expense increased primarily due to increased labor costs. Employee taxes and benefits expense increased primarily due to increased costs related to group insurance. 
 
 Total noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 120.2 million, a 8.7 million, or 7.8 , increase compared to 111.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 4.2 million in professional fees and assessments, 3.6 million in compensation, and 1.3 million in employee taxes and benefits expense. The increase in professional fees and assessments was primarily due to increased merger-related expenses in connection with the acquisition of HMNF and an increase in FDIC assessments. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to rising labor costs. The increase in employee taxes and benefits expense was primarily due to increased costs related to group insurance and payroll taxes. These increases were partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in business services, software and technology expense primarily due to reduced core processing and information technology hardware expenses. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense is an estimate based on the amount the Company expects to owe the applicable taxing authorities, plus the impact of deferred tax items. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due, or to be received from, taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company s tax position. If the final resolution of taxes payable differs from the Company s estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions, adjustments to tax expense may be required. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized income tax expense of 1.6 million on 6.8 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.4 , compared to income tax expense of 2.4 million on 11.5 million of pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.6 . 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized income tax expense of 5.6 million on 23.5 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.9 , compared to income tax expense of 7.2 million on 33.7 million of pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.4 . 
 
 Segment Reporting 
 
 The Company determined reportable segments based on the significance of the services offered, the significance of those services to the Company s financial condition and operating results, and the Company s regular review of the operating results of those services. The Company has three operating segments banking, retirement and benefit services, and wealth. These segments are components for which financial information is prepared and evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. 
 
 The selected financial information presented for each segment sets forth net interest income, provision for loan losses, noninterest income, and direct and indirect noninterest expense overhead allocations. Corporate administration includes all remaining income and expenses not allocated to the three operating segments. Certain reclassification adjustments have been made between corporate administration and the various lines of business for consistency in presentation. 
 
 For additional financial information on the Company s segments see NOTE 17 Segment Reporting of the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Banking 
 
 The banking division offers a complete line of loan, deposit, cash management, and treasury services through fourteen offices in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Arizona. After the closing of the HMNF acquisition, the Company added 15 banking offices in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. These products and services are supported through web and mobile based applications. The majority of the Company s assets and liabilities are in the banking segment s balance sheet.

Loans 
 
 The loan portfolio represents a broad range of borrowers comprised of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, agricultural, and consumer loans. 
 
 Total loans outstanding were 3.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 272.8 million, or 9.9 , from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 116.7 million increase in non-owner occupied CRE loans, a 49.6 million increase in construction, land and development CRE loans, a 44.1 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, a 30.3 million increase in multifamily CRE loans, and a 24.7 million increase in owner occupied CRE loans, partially offset by 7.4 million and 17.2 million decreases in residential real estate first lien and residential real estate construction loans, respectively. 
 
 The Company s loan portfolio is highly diversified. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 19.9 of loans outstanding were commercial and industrial, 47.3 of loans outstanding were CRE, 2.8 of loans outstanding were agricultural, and 30.0 of loans outstanding were consumer.

Despite headwinds from a higher interest rate environment and competition in the Company s market areas, the Company anticipates continued loan growth in the remainder of 2024 for the commercial and industrial and CRE loan portfolios as a result of recently added production talent. 
 
 Commercial and industrial loans represent loans for working capital, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within the Bank s geographical footprint. These loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer s industry and the customer s market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer s assets, including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment and other property, and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the ongoing cash flow from operations of the customer s business. In addition, revolving lines of credit are generally governed by a borrowing base. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a continuous basis through interim reporting, covenant testing and annual underwriting. 
 
 CRE loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on real property and include both owner occupied CRE loans as well as non-owner occupied loans. Non-owner occupied CRE loans consist of mortgage loans to finance investments in real property that may include, but are not limited to, multi-family, industrial, office, retail and other specific use properties as well as CRE construction loans that are offered to builders and developers generally within the Bank s geographical footprint. The primary risk characteristics in the non-owner occupied portfolio include impacts of overall leasing rates, absorption timelines, levels of vacancy rates and operating expenses. The Company requires collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements and equity investment in the project. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. Inherent lending risks are monitored on a continuous basis through quarterly monitoring and the Bank s annual underwriting process, incorporating an analysis of cash flow, collateral, market conditions and guarantor liquidity, if applicable. CRE loan policies are specific to individual product types and underwriting parameters vary depending on the risk profile of each asset class. CRE loan policies are reviewed no less than semi-annually by management and approved by the Bank s Board of Directors to ensure they align with current market conditions and the Bank s moderate risk appetite. Construction loans are monitored monthly and includes on-site inspections. Management reviews all construction loans quarterly to ensure projects are on time and within budget. CRE concentration limits have been established by product type and are monitored quarterly by the Bank s Credit Governance Committee and Bank Board of Directors. 
 
 CRE loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The Company does not monitor the CRE portfolio for attributes such as loan-to-value ratios, occupancy rates or net operating income, as these characteristics are assessed and evaluated on an individual loan basis. Portfolio stress testing is completed based on property type and takes into consideration changes to net operating income and capitalization rates. The Company does not have exposure to the office building sector in central business districts as the office portfolio is generally diversified in suburban markets with strong occupancy levels.

The Bank does not currently monitor owner occupied CRE loans based on geographical markets, as the primary source of repayment for these loans is predicated on the cash flow from the underlying operating entity. These loans are generally located within the Company s geographical footprint. 
 
 Highly competitive conditions continue to prevail in the small- and middle-market commercial segments in which the Company primarily operates. The Company maintains a commitment to generating growth in the Company s business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins. The Company continues to invest in additional personnel, technology and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities. 
 
 Agricultural loans include loans secured by farmland and loans for agricultural production. Farmland includes purposes such as crop and livestock production. Farmland loans are typically written with amortizing payment structures. Collateral values for farmland are determined based upon appraisals and evaluations in accordance with established policy guidelines and maximum loan-to-value ratios at origination are governed by established policy and regulatory guidelines. Agricultural production loans are for the purpose of financing working capital and/or capital investment for agriculture production activities. Collateral generally consists of pledges of business assets including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, plant and equipment, and/or real estate in applicable. Agricultural production loans are primarily paid by the operating cash flow of the borrower. Agricultural production loans may be secured or unsecured. 
 
 Residential real estate loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15- to 30-year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence with both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate terms. Real estate construction loans are also offered to consumers who wish to build their own homes and are often structured to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase, which is typically twelve months. RRE loans also include home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by a first or second lien on the borrower s residence. Home equity lines of credit, or HELOC , consist mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by residential real estate. 
 
 Other consumer loans include loans made to individuals not secured by real estate, including loans secured by automobiles or watercraft, and personal unsecured loans. 
 
 The Company originates both fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans conforming to the underwriting guidelines of the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, as well as home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by first or junior liens. Most of the Company s fixed rate residential loans, along with some of the Company s adjustable rate mortgages are sold to other financial institutions with which the Company has established a correspondent lending relationship. 
 
 The Company s RRE loans have minimal direct exposure to subprime mortgages as the loans are underwritten to conform to secondary market standards. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s RRE portfolio was 873.0 million, representing a 8.0 million, or 0.9 , decrease from 881.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Market interest rates, expected duration, and the Company s overall interest rate sensitivity profile continue to be the most significant factors in determining whether the Company chooses to retain versus sell portions of new consumer mortgage originations.

Table of Contents 

The expected life of the Company s loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Consequently, the table above includes information limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 The Company s strategy for credit risk management includes well defined, centralized credit policies; uniform underwriting criteria; and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, and client level; regular credit examinations; and management reviews of loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. The Company strives to identify potential problem loans early, take necessary charge offs promptly, and maintain adequate reserve levels for credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Management performs ongoing, internal reviews of any problem credits and continually assesses the adequacy of the allowance. The Company utilizes an internal lending division, Special Credit Services, to develop and implement strategies for the management of individual nonperforming loans. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 Loans are assigned a risk rating and grouped into categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The risk ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories. The criticized categories include special mention, substandard, and doubtful risk ratings. See NOTE 5 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses of the consolidated financial statements for a definition of each of the risk ratings. 
 
 The table below presents criticized loans outstanding by loan portfolio segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

25.0 million of the increase in nonaccrual loans was driven by one construction, land and development loan moving to nonaccrual status in the second quarter of 2024 and an additional advance on the same loan in the third quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, management elected to make protective advances in order for construction to continue on that project. Management is actively working with the borrower on strategies to complete construction, preserve value and support repayment of the loan. A large RRE relationship and one non-owner occupied CRE loan moving to nonaccrual status also contributed 13.6 million to the increase in nonaccrual loans during the third quarter of 2024. 

56

Table of Contents 

Interest income lost on nonaccrual loans approximated 2.8 million and 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There was no interest income included in net interest income related to nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The allowance for credit losses, or ACL, on loans is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio over the remaining estimated life of loans in the portfolio. Under the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard, the ACL is a valuation estimated at each balance sheet date and deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held for investment to present the net amount expected to be collected. These evaluations are inherently subjective as they require management to make material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by actual charge offs, net of recoveries. 
 
 Management estimates the ACL using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience provides the basis for estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in the current loan-specific risk characteristics such as different underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or life of the loan, as well as changes in environmental conditions, levels of economic activity, unemployment rates, property values and other relevant factors. The calculation also contemplates that the Company may not be able to make or obtain such forecasts for the entire life of the financial assets and requires a reversion to historical loss information. 
 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. The ACL on individually evaluated loans is recognized on the basis of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral adjusted of estimated costs to sell, or observable market price as of the relevant date.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit, including commitments under credit arrangements, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. An ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is measured using similar internal and external assumptions as the ACL on loans. This allowance is located in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The ACL for unfunded commitments was 7.4 million and 5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 Deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and economic conditions, and fluctuations in the Company s customers own liquidity needs and may also be influenced by recent developments in the financial services industry, including the large-scale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures. 
 
 Total deposits were 3.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 227.9 million, or 7.4 , from December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased 300.4 million during this period, while noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 67.9 million. The increase in total deposits was due to both expanded and new commercial deposit relationships, along with time deposit and synergistic deposit growth. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased from 23.5 of total deposits as of December 31, 2023 to 19.8 as of September 30, 2024, as higher yields on interest-bearing accounts and other investment alternatives, such as U.S. treasuries, attracted such funds. Time deposit balances increased as higher short-term CD rates attracted both existing non-maturity deposits as well as new deposits to the Company.

Capital Resources 
 
 Stockholders equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, the Company s sales and repurchases of its common stock and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale securities. 
 
 Stockholders equity increased 17.4 million, or 4.7 , to 386.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 369.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Tangible common equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased to 8.11 as of September 30, 2024, from 7.94 as of December 31, 2023. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets decreased to 11.12 as of September 30, 2024, from 11.82 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company strives to maintain an adequate capital base to support the Company s activities in a safe and sound manner while at the same time attempting to maximize stockholder value. Capital adequacy is assessed against the risk inherent in the Company s balance sheet, recognizing that unexpected loss is the common denominator of risk, and that common equity has the greatest capacity to absorb unexpected loss. 
 
 The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the Company and at the Bank level. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, specific capital guidelines must be met that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. The Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well-capitalized standards.

 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of the Company s customers. These financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. These commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party. The credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be required based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness. The fair value of these commitments is considered immaterial for disclosure purposes. 
 
 A summary of the contractual amounts of the Company s exposure to off balance sheet agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was as follows:

Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity management is the process by which the Company manages the flow of funds necessary to meet the Company s financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities. These financial commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, expenses of the Company s operations, and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the Company s asset and liability committee, or the ALCO, a group of senior officers from the finance, enterprise risk management, deposit, investment, treasury, and lending areas. It is the ALCO s responsibility to ensure the Company has the necessary level of funds available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that potential liquidity stress events are planned for, quickly identified, and that management has plans in place to respond. The ALCO has created policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including modeling and management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had on balance sheet liquidity of 424.8 million, compared to 668.2 million as of December 31, 2023. On balance sheet liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents, federal funds sold, unencumbered securities available for sale, and over collateralized securities pledging positions available-for-sale. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had off balance sheet liquidity of 1.8 billion, compared to 1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. Off balance sheet liquidity includes FHLB borrowing capacity, federal funds lines, and brokered deposit capacity. There were no brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides short and long term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate related assets and other select collateral, most typically in the form of debt securities. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 44.7 million in federal funds purchased and 200.0 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.1 billion of collateral pledged to the FHLB and, based on this collateral, the Company was eligible to borrow up to an additional 851.4 million from the FHLB. In addition, the Company can borrow up to 107.0 million through the unsecured lines of credit the Company has established with four other correspondent banks.

Table of Contents 

In addition, because the Bank is well capitalized, the Company can accept wholesale deposits up to 20.0 of total assets based on current policy limits, or 816.9 million, as of September 30, 2024. Management believed that the Company had adequate resources to fund all of the Company s commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company s primary sources of liquidity include liquid assets, as well as unencumbered securities that can be used to collateralize additional funding. 
 
 Though remote, the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions. The economic impact of the recent rise in inflation and rising interest rates could place increased demand on the Company s liquidity if the Company experiences significant credit deterioration and as the Company meets borrowers needs. Accordingly, management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan, which has been reviewed and approved by both the Bank s Board of Directors and the ALCO. The plan addresses the actions that the Company would take in response to both a short term and long term funding crisis. 
 
 A short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system, either internal or external, which disrupts orderly short term funding operations. Such a crisis would likely be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings. A long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of both external and internal factors and would most likely result in drastic credit deterioration. Management believes that both potential circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and equity value arising from changes in market interest rates and arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there is a divergence between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, re price, or mature in specified periods. The Company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and equity while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates. The ALCO oversees market risk management, monitoring risk measures, limits, and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. The Bank s Board of Directors approves policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective interest rate risk management begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk position given business activities, management objectives, market expectations and ALCO policy limits and guidelines. 
 
 Interest rate risk can come in a variety of forms, including repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes impact the Company s assets and liabilities. Basis risk is the risk of adverse consequence resulting from unequal change in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity. Yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same or different instruments. Option risk in financial instruments arises from embedded options such as options provided to borrowers to make unscheduled loan prepayments, options provided to debt issuers to exercise call options prior to maturity, and depositor options to make withdrawals and early redemptions. 
 
 Management regularly reviews the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates. Among the factors considered are changes in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, interest rate spreads and repricing periods. The ALCO reviews, on at least a quarterly basis, the interest rate risk position. 
 
 The interest rate risk position is measured and monitored at the Bank using net interest income simulation models and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis that capture both short term and long term interest rate risk exposure. 
 
 Modeling the sensitivity of net interest income and the economic value of equity to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. The models used for these measurements rely on estimates of the potential impact that changes in interest rates may have on the value and prepayment speeds on all components of the Company s loan portfolio, investment portfolio, as well as embedded options and cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The balance sheet composition and size are assumed to remain static in the simulation modeling process. The analysis provides a framework as to what the Company s overall sensitivity position is as of the Company s most recent reported position and the impact that potential changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the economic value of the Company s equity. 
 
 Net interest income simulation involves forecasting net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios including instantaneous shocks. 
 
 The estimated impact on the Company s net interest income as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming immediate parallel moves in interest rates, is presented in the table below:

Management strategies may impact future reporting periods, as actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed, as well as changes in market conditions. Market-based prepayment speeds are factored into the analysis for loan and securities portfolios. Rate sensitivity for transactional deposit accounts is modeled based on both historical experience and external industry studies. 
 
 Management uses an economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of interest rate changes on long term cash flows, income, and capital. Economic value of equity is based on discounting the cash flows for all balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios. Deposit premiums are based on external industry studies and utilizing historical experience. 
 
 The table below presents the change in the economic value of equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assuming immediate parallel shifts in interest rates:

Operational Risk 
 
 Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human behavior, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. Management continuously strives to strengthen its system of internal controls, enterprise risk management, operating processes and employee awareness to assess the impact on earnings and capital and to improve the oversight of the Company s operational risk. 
 
 Compliance Risk 
 
 Compliance risk represents the risk of regulatory sanctions, reputational impact or financial loss resulting from failure to comply with rules and regulations issued by the various banking agencies and standards of good banking practice. Activities which may expose the Company to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending challenges resulting from the expansion of the Company s banking center network, employment and tax matters. 
 
 Strategic and/or Reputation Risk 
 
 Strategic and/or reputation risk represents the risk of loss due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, and any other event not identified in the defined risk types mentioned previously. Mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic and/or reputation risk is achieved through initiatives to help management better understand and report on various risks, including those related to the development of new products and business initiatives. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Accounting Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and its Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1 Legal Proceedings 
 
 There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries are a party or to which the Company s property is the subject. 
 
 Item 1A Risk Factors 
 
 Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024. 
 
 Risks Related to the Merger 
 
 Litigation May Be Filed Against the Company (directly or as successor by merger to HMNF) (or the Company s or HMNF s Boards of Directors) that Could Result in the Payment of Damages Following Consummation of the Merger. 
 
 It is possible that, in connection with the merger of HMNF with and into the Company, stockholders may file putative class action lawsuits against the Company directly or against the Company as successor by merger to HMNF (or the Company s or HMNF s boards of directors). One purported stockholders of the Company, and eight purported stockholders of HMNF, sent demand letters to the companies prior to the closing of the merger, alleging that the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Company omitted certain material information regarding the merger and threatening litigation. Although the transaction has closed, these stockholders could still pursue litigation against the Company directly against the Company as successor by merger to HMNF to seek financial damages. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that results from these lawsuits, including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers of each company, may adversely affect the combined company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market price of the stock of the Company. 
 
 The Company May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Merger. 
 
 The merger of HMNF with and into the Company closed on October 9, 2024. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, the Company s ability to combine the businesses of the Company and HMNF in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of the Company or HMNF nor result in decreased revenues due to any loss of customers. If the Company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, operating results, prospects and stock price as the resulting company of the merger.
