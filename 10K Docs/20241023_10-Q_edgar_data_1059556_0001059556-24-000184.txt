 Unbilled receivables 
 For certain MA arrangements, the timing of when the Company has the unconditional right to consideration and recognizes revenue occurs prior to invoicing the customer. In addition, certain MIS arrangements contain contractual terms whereby the customers are billed in arrears for annual monitoring services, requiring revenue to be accrued as an unbilled receivable as such services are provided.

Deferred revenue 
 The Company recognizes deferred revenue when a contract requires a customer to pay consideration to the Company in advance of when revenue related to that contract is recognized. This deferred revenue is relieved when the Company satisfies the related performance obligation and revenue is recognized.

 Deferred revenue - current Deferred revenue - non-current 
 For the MA segment, the decrease in deferred revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to the recognition of annual subscription and maintenance billings from December and January. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the decrease in the deferred revenue balance is attributable to recognition of revenues related to the aforementioned December billings being mostly offset by the impact of the high concentration of billings in the first quarter. 
 For the MIS segment, the change in the deferred revenue balance for all periods presented was primarily related to the significant portion of contract renewals that occur during the first quarter and are generally recognized over a one year period.

billion. The Company expects to recognize into revenue approximately of this balance within , approximately of this balance between one to and the remaining amount thereafter. 
 Remaining performance obligations in the MIS segment largely reflect deferred revenue related to monitoring fees for certain structured finance products, primarily CMBS, where the issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees for the life of the security in advance. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately million. The Company expects to recognize into revenue approximately of this balance within , approximately of this balance between one to and the remaining amount thereafter. With respect to the remaining performance obligations for the MIS segment, the Company has applied a practical expedient set forth in ASC Topic 606 permitting the omission of unsatisfied performance obligations relating to contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

 Tax benefit 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the Company granted million employee stock options, which had a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. The Company also granted million shares of restricted stock in the first nine months of 2024, which had a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. Both the employee stock options and restricted stock generally vest ratably over . Additionally, the Company granted million shares of performance-based awards whereby the number of shares that ultimately vest are based on the achievement of certain non-market-based performance metrics of the Company over a period of two to . The weighted average grant date fair value of these awards was per share.

 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Moody s ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The increase in the ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2023, which reflect the resolution of uncertain tax positions in various U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and will not recur in 2024. The Company s year-to-date provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed by applying its estimated annual ETR to the pre-tax earnings primarily due to the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of million and a change in tax rate of a non-U.S. tax jurisdiction of million. 
 The Company classifies interest related to UTPs in interest expense, net in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized in other non-operating income, net. The Company had a net increase in its UTP reserves of million, net of federal tax, during the third quarter of 2024 and an increase in its UTPs of million, net of federal tax, during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 For ongoing audits, it is possible the balance of UTPs could decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the settlement of such audits, which might involve the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the recognition of tax benefits. It is also possible that new issues will be raised by tax authorities which could necessitate increases to the balance of UTPs. As the Company is unable to predict the timing or outcome of these audits, it is unable to estimate the amount of future changes to the balance of UTPs at this time. However, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for its financial exposure relating to all open tax years, by tax jurisdiction, in accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC Topic 740 regarding UTPs. 
 
 Effective in 2024, multiple foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates have enacted legislation to adopt a minimum tax rate described in the Global Anti-Base Erosion tax model rules (referred to as GloBE or Pillar II) issued by the OECD. A minimum ETR of 15 applies to multinational companies with consolidated revenue above 750 million. Under the GloBE rules, a company is required to determine a combined ETR for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate is less than 15 , an additional tax generally will be due to bring the jurisdictional ETR up to 15 . We have evaluated the impact of the Pillar II global minimum tax rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As of September 30, 2024, the Pillar II minimum tax requirement is not expected to have a material impact on our full-year results of operations or financial position.

 (1) Represents fair value of certain derivative contracts as more fully described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 The following are descriptions of the methodologies utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of its derivative contracts, money market mutual funds and mutual funds: 
 Derivatives: 
 In determining the fair value of the derivative contracts in the table above, the Company utilizes industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using spot rates, forward points, currency volatilities, interest rates as well as the risk of non-performance of the Company and the counterparties with whom it has derivative contracts. The Company established strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions that adhere to these guidelines. Accordingly, the risk of counterparty default is deemed to be minimal. 
 Money market funds and mutual funds: 
 The mutual funds in the table above are deemed to be equity securities with readily determinable fair values with changes in the fair value recognized through net income under ASC Topic 321. The fair value of these instruments is determined using Level 1 inputs as defined in the ASC Topic 820.

 Revenue for MA and expenses for MIS include an intersegment fee charged to MIS from MA for certain MA products and services utilized in MIS s ratings process. Additionally, revenue for MIS and expenses for MA include intersegment fees charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. These intersegment fees are generally based on the market value of the products and services being transferred between the segments. 
 Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and legal. Such costs and corporate expenses that exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. 
 For overhead costs and corporate expenses that benefit both segments, costs are allocated to each segment based on the segment s share of full-year 2018 actual revenue which comprises a Baseline Pool established in 2019, which will remain fixed over time. In subsequent periods, incremental overhead costs (or reductions thereof) will be allocated to each segment based on the prevailing shares of total revenue represented by each segment. 
 Eliminations in the following table represent intersegment revenue/expense. Moody s does not report the Company s assets by reportable segment, as this metric is not used by the CODM to allocate resources to the segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by reportable segment.

We use our specialized knowledge and assets to make a positive difference through technology tools, research and analytical services that help other organizations and the investor community better understand the links between sustainability considerations and the global markets. During 2024, Moody's received the following awards and recognition for its sustainability-related efforts: 
 Recognized among America s 100 Most JUST Companies by JUST Capital and CNBC for its commitment to serving its workforce, customers, communities, the environment, and stockholders for its sustainability-related efforts; 
 Made CDP's 2023 Climate Change 'A' List, in recognition of Moody's leadership in corporate transparency and actions taken to mitigate climate change;

 The Board oversees sustainability matters via the Audit, Governance Nominating and Compensation Human Resources Committees, as part of its oversight of management and the Company s overall strategy. The Audit Committee oversees financial, risk and other disclosures made in the Company s annual and quarterly reports related to sustainability and has overseen the expanded voluntary disclosures the Company has made in its periodic filings. The Governance Nominating Committee oversees sustainability matters, including significant issues of corporate social and environmental responsibility, as they pertain to the Company s business and to long-term value creation for the Company and its stockholders, and makes recommendations to the Board regarding these issues. This has helped to develop the Company s robust ESG strategy. Finally, the Compensation Human Resources Committee oversees inclusion of sustainability-related performance goals for determining compensation of all senior executives. This oversight has resulted in the Company more fully integrating sustainability-related performance metrics into the strategic operational compensation metric of all senior executives. The Board also oversees Moody s policies for assessing and managing the Company's exposure to risk, including climate-related risks such as business continuity disruption and

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, contingencies, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, pension and other retirement benefits, investments in non-consolidated affiliates, and income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Item 7, MD A, in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, includes descriptions of some of the judgments that Moody s makes in applying its accounting estimates in these areas. Since the date of the annual report on Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates disclosures other than the update below relating to the Company's annual assessment of goodwill for impairment. 
 Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
 At July 31st of each year, Moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., MA and MIS), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment). 
 The Company has four reporting units: two reporting units within MA consisting of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and CRE solutions, and two within the Company s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody s other ratings operations). 
 The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired, and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions, realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. 
 At July 31, 2024, the Company performed quantitative assessments for each of the four reporting units in accordance with the aforementioned policy. These quantitative assessments resulted in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. Accordingly, at the date of the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company does not believe that any of its reporting units are at risk for impairment. 
 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are more fully described below. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units. 
 Other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.

 Methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units: 
 The following is a discussion regarding the Company s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding ICRA, as of July 31, 2024. As ICRA is a publicly traded company in India, the Company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization. 
 The fair value of each reporting unit, excluding ICRA, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company s financial position and results of operations. Moody s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. 
 The sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and WACC assumptions are described below. These key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology require significant management judgment: 
 Future cash flow assumptions - The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. These projections are consistent with the Company s operating budget and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. Beyond five years, a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. For each reporting unit analyzed, a 10 reduction in the revenue growth rates used would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values. 
 WACC - The WACC is the rate used to discount each reporting unit s estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate and an equity risk factor, which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit s cash flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Company s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 10.0 to 10.5 as of July 31, 2024. Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units as of July 31, 2024 for each reporting unit. For all reporting units, an increase in the WACC of one percentage point would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values. 
 
 Reportable Segments 
 The Company is organized into two reportable segments as of September 30, 2024: MA and MIS, which are more fully described in the section entitled The Company above and in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Moody's remains committed to using its cash flow to create value for shareholders by both investing in the Company's employees and growing the business through targeted organic initiatives and inorganic acquisitions aligned with strategic priorities. Additional excess capital is returned to the Company s shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. 
 Cash Flow 
 The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases from operating and financing cash flows. 
 The following is a summary of the changes in the Company s cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Favorable (Unfavorable) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 2,164 1,674 490 Net cash used in investing activities (875) (193) (682) Net cash used in financing activities (812) (1,231) 419 Free Cash Flow (1) 
 1,921 1,476 445 
 (1) Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital expenditures. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures of this MD A for further information on this financial measure. 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash flows from operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 490 million compared to the same period in 2023, with the most notable drivers reflecting: 
 growth in operating income of 675 million; 
 partially offset by: 
 178 million in higher income tax payments in the current year. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 The 682 million increase in cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to: 
 higher net purchases of investments in 2024 of 528 million; 
 higher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of 107 million primarily due to the acquisitions of GCR and Praedicat in the third quarter of 2024, coupled with certain immaterial acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2024; and 
 higher cash paid for capital additions of 45 million compared to the prior year reflecting both costs to support investments in company-wide technology infrastructure coupled with costs related to the development of SaaS-based solutions in MA. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 The 419 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily attributed to: 
 a 500 million repayment of notes payable in 2023; and 
 a 496 million issuance of notes in the third quarter of 2024; 
 partially offset by: 
 higher cash paid for treasury share repurchases in 2024 of 534 million compared to the prior year. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments 
 The Company s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 3.2 billion at September 30, 2024 included approximately 2.1 billion located outside of the U.S. Approximately 31 of the Company s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in euros and GBP. The Company manages both its U.S. and non-U.S. cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs. 
 As a result of the Tax Act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to U.S. tax. The Company continues to evaluate which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the U.S. The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, the Company continues to repatriate a portion of its non-U.S. cash in these subsidiaries and will continue to repatriate certain of its offshore cash in a manner that addresses compliance with local statutory requirements, sufficient offshore working capital and any other factors that may be relevant in certain jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the Tax Act, which generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the U.S., cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes or withholding or similar taxes. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 The Company's material cash requirements consist of the following contractual and other obligations: 
 Financing Arrangements 
 Indebtedness 
 At September 30, 2024, Moody s had 7.6 billion of outstanding debt and approximately 1 billion of additional capacity available under the Company s CP Program, which is backstopped by the 1.25 billion 2024 Facility. 
 The repayment schedule for the Company s borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 
 72 

Table of Contents 

 For additional information on the Company's outstanding debt, refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Future interest payments and fees associated with the Company's debt and credit facility are expected to be 4.8 billion, of which approximately 300 million is expected to be paid in each of the next five years, and the remaining amount expected to be paid thereafter. 
 Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which could result in higher financing costs. 
 Purchase Obligations 
 Purchase obligations generally include multi-year agreements with vendors to purchase goods or services and mainly include data center/cloud hosting fees and fees for information technology licensing and maintenance. As of September 30, 2024, these purchase obligations totaled 683 million, of which approximately 40 is expected to be paid in the next twelve months and another approximate 45 expected to be paid over the next two subsequent years, with the remainder to be paid thereafter. 
 Leases 
 The Company has remaining payments relating to its operating leases of 376 million at September 30, 2024, primarily related to real estate leases, of which 118 million in payments are expected over the next twelve months. For more information on the expected cash flows relating to the Company's operating leases, refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Pension and Other Retirement Plan Obligations 
 The Company does not anticipate making significant contributions to its funded pension plan in the next twelve months. This plan is overfunded at September 30, 2024, and accordingly holds sufficient investments to fund future benefit obligations. Payments for the Company's unfunded plans are not expected to be material in either the short or long-term. 
 Dividends and share repurchases 
 On October 21, 2024, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of 0.85 per share for Moody s common stock, payable December 13, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 22, 2024. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board. 
 On February 5, 2024, the Board approved 1 billion in share repurchase authority. At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 547 million of remaining authority under this authorization. On October 15, 2024, the Board authorized an additional 1.5 billion in share repurchase authority. There is no established expiration date for the remaining authorizations. 
 Sources of Funding to Satisfy Material Cash Requirements 
 The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow over the next twelve months. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources as described above. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 In addition to its reported results, Moody s has included in this MD A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as Non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that such adjusted financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company s performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These adjusted measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore, these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are brief descriptions of the Company s adjusted financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the adjusted measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure: 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin : 
 The Company presents Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody's operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income excludes the impact of: i) depreciation and amortization; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; and iii) charges related to an asset abandonment. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different estimated useful lives and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Restructuring charges/adjustments and charges related to asset abandonment are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. 
 Management believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company s operating results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue.

 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS attributable to Moody's common shareholders: 
 The Company presents Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody s operating performance. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude the impact of: i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; iii) charges related to asset abandonment; and iv) gains on previously held equity method investments. 
 The Company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different estimated useful lives and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. These intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisition accounting and contribute to revenue generation. The amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. Restructuring charges/adjustments, charges related to asset abandonment, and gains on previously held equity method investments are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these items may vary widely across periods and companies. 
 The Company excludes the aforementioned items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted EPS from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.

 Free Cash Flow : 
 The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital additions. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of Moody s cash flow. Below is a reconciliation of the Company s net cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 2,164 1,674 Capital additions (243) (198) Free Cash Flow 1,921 1,476 Net cash used in investing activities (875) (193) Net cash used in financing activities (812) (1,231) 

Key Performance Metrics: 
 The Company presents Annualized Recurring Revenue ARR on a constant currency organic basis for its MA business as a supplemental performance metric to provide additional insight on the estimated value of MA's recurring revenue contracts at a given point in time. The Company uses ARR to manage and monitor performance of its MA operating segment and believes that this metric is a key indicator of the trajectory of MA's recurring revenue base. 
 The Company calculates ARR by taking the total recurring contract value for each active renewable contract as of the reporting date, divided by the number of days in the contract and multiplied by 365 days to create an annualized value. The Company defines renewable contracts as subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and renewable services. ARR excludes transaction sales including one-time training, services and perpetual licenses. In order to compare period-over-period ARR excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the Company bases the calculation on currency rates utilized in its current year operating budget and holds these FX rates constant for the duration of all current and prior periods being reported. Additionally, ARR excludes contracts related to acquisitions to provide additional perspective in assessing growth excluding the impacts from certain acquisition activity. 
 The Company s definition of ARR may differ from definitions utilized by other companies reporting similarly named measures, and this metric should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

 the uncertain effectiveness and possible collateral consequences of U.S. and foreign government initiatives and monetary policy to respond to the current economic climate, including instability of financial institutions, credit quality concerns, and other potential impacts of volatility in financial and credit markets; 
 the global impacts of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the military conflict in the Middle East on volatility in world financial markets, on general economic conditions and GDP in the U.S. and worldwide, on global relations and on the Company's own operations and personnel; 
 other matters that could affect the volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets, including regulation, increased utilization of technologies that have the potential to intensify competition and accelerate disruption and disintermediation in the financial services industry, as well as the number of issuances of securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties; 
 the level of merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. and abroad; 
 the uncertain effectiveness and possible collateral consequences of U.S. and foreign government actions affecting credit markets, international trade and economic policy, including those related to tariffs, tax agreements and trade barriers; 
 the impact of MIS s withdrawal of its credit ratings on countries or entities within countries and of Moody s no longer conducting commercial operations in countries where political instability warrants such actions; 
 concerns in the marketplace affecting our credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the integrity or utility of independent credit agency ratings; 
 the introduction or development of competing and/or emerging technologies and products; 
 pricing pressure from competitors and/or customers; 
 the level of success of new product development and global expansion; 
 the impact of regulation as an NRSRO, the potential for new U.S., state and local legislation and regulations; 
 the potential for increased competition and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the EU; 
 exposure to litigation related to our rating opinions, as well as any other litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries to which Moody s may be subject from time to time; 
 provisions in U.S. legislation modifying the pleading standards and EU regulations modifying the liability standards, applicable to CRAs in a manner adverse to CRAs; 
 provisions of EU regulations imposing additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services and the expansion of supervisory remit to include non-EU ratings used for regulatory purposes; 
 uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and China;

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no significant changes to the Company's market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: The Company carried out an evaluation, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the communication to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has determined that there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. The Company's management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all instances of error and fraud. Any control system, regardless of how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

In all instances the Committee (and its delegees) shall have complete discretionary authority to determine eligibility for participation and benefits under the Plan, as well as any other matter of fact or interpretation relating to the Plan, and to construe and interpret all provisions of the Plan and all documents relating thereto including, without limitation, all disputed and uncertain terms. It is the intention of the preceding sentences that the Committee s (and its delegees decision(s), if reviewed by a Federal or state court or an arbitrator, are reviewed based on an abuse of discretion or arbitrary or capricious standard, and not a de novo standard, and that all deference permitted by law shall be given to such constructions, interpretations and determinations of the Committee (and its delegees). Should any dispute arise as to eligibility to receive, or amount of, benefits provided under the Plan, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the Claims Procedures attached hereto as Schedule B. 
 4.4 Any action to be taken by the Committee shall be taken by a majority of its members either at a meeting or by written instrument approved by such majority in the absence of a meeting. A written resolution or memorandum signed by one Committee member and the secretary of the Committee shall be sufficient evidence to any person of any action taken pursuant to the Plan. 
 4.5 Any person, corporation or other entity may serve in more than one capacity under the Plan. 
 4.6 The Company shall indemnify any individual who is a director, officer or employee of a Participating Company, or his or her heirs and legal representatives, against all liability and reasonable expense, including counsel fees, amounts paid in settlement and amounts of judgments, fines or penalties, incurred or imposed upon him or her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in connection with his or her duties with respect to the Plan, provided that any act 

or omission giving rise to such claim, action, suit or proceeding does not constitute willful misconduct or is not performed or omitted in bad faith. 
 ARTICLE 5 
 MISCELLANEOUS 
 5.1 Neither the establishment of the Plan nor any action of a Participating Company, the Committee, or any fiduciary shall be held or construed to confer upon any person any legal right to continue employment with a Participating Company. Each Participating Company expressly reserves the right to discharge any employee to the same extent as if the Plan had not been put into effect. 
 5.2 Benefits payable under the Plan shall be paid out of the general assets of a Participating Company. No Participating Company needs to fund the benefits payable under this Plan however, nothing in this Section 5.2 shall be interpreted as precluding any Participating Company from funding or setting aside amounts in anticipation of paying such benefits. Any benefits payable to an Eligible Employee under this Plan shall represent an unsecured claim by such Eligible Employee against the general assets of the Participating Company that employed such Eligible Employee. 
 5.3 A Participating Company shall deduct from the amount of any severance benefits payable hereunder the amount required by law to be withheld for the payment of any taxes and any other amounts properly to be withheld. 
 5.4 Benefits payable under the Plan shall not be subject to assignment, alienation, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, commutation or anticipation by the Eligible Employee. Any attempt to assign, alienate, transfer, pledge, encumber, commute or anticipate Plan benefits shall be void. 
 5.5 This Plan shall be construed, whenever possible, to be in conformity with the requirements of ERISA, or any subsequent laws or amendments thereto. To the extent not in conflict with the preceding sentence or another provision of the Plan, the construction and administration of the Plan shall be in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York (without reference to its conflicts of law provisions). This Plan will be of no force or effect with respect to an Eligible Employee to the extent superseded by foreign law. 
 5.6 This Plan supersedes any and all prior severance arrangements, policies, plans or practices of the Company and of any Participating Company (whether written or unwritten). 
 5.7 Should any provisions of the Plan be deemed or held to be unlawful or invalid for any reason, such fact shall not adversely affect the other provisions of the Plan unless such determination shall render impossible or impracticable the functioning of the Plan, and in such case, an appropriate provision or provisions shall be adopted so that the Plan may continue to function properly. 

5.8 In the event that the Committee finds that an Eligible Employee (or designated beneficiary) is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, then benefits payable hereunder, unless claim has been made therefor by a duly appointed guardian, committee, or other legal representative, may be paid in such manner as the Committee shall determine, and the application thereof shall be a complete discharge of all liability for any payments or benefits to which such Eligible Employee (or designated beneficiary) was or would have been otherwise entitled under this Plan. 
 5.9 Any payments to a minor from this Plan may be paid by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion (a) directly to such minor (b) to the legal or natural guardian of such minor or (c) to any other person, whether or not appointed guardian of the minor, who shall have the care and custody of such minor. The receipt by such individual shall be a complete discharge of all liability under the Plan therefor. 
 5.10 The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code or an exemption thereunder and shall be construed and administered in accordance with such intention. Any payment under the Plan that may be excluded from coverage under Section 409A of the Code either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service or as a short-term deferral shall be excluded from such coverage to the maximum extent possible. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, each installment payment provided under this Plan shall be treated as a separate payment. To the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, any payments to be made under this Plan upon a termination of employment shall be made only if such termination of employment constitutes a separation from service for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. 

ARTICLE 6 
 YOUR RIGHTS UNDER ERISA 
 As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to 
 RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PLAN AND BENEFITS 
 Examine, without charge, at the office of the Plan Administrator (as defined below) and at other specified locations, such as worksites and union halls, all documents governing the plan, including insurance contracts, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. 
 Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the plan and summary plan description. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. 
 PRUDENT ACTIONS BY PLAN FIDUCIARIES 
 In addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your plan, called fiduciaries of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. 
 ENFORCE YOUR RIGHTS 
 If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 
 Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal Court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to 110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a State or Federal Court. If plan fiduciaries misuse the plan s money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal Court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order 

the persons you have sued to pay these cost and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. 
 ASSISTANCE WITH YOUR QUESTIONS 
 If you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in you telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries. Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

 1. Severance Benefits. 
 (a) If the Eligible Employee is employed in Job Group A (as defined in this paragraph), has one or more Years of Service, and incurs an Eligible Termination for any reason other than unsatisfactory performance, the Eligible Employee shall receive the higher of (i) 10 weeks of Salary or (ii) 2 weeks of Salary for each Year of Service.

 (b) If the Eligible Employee is employed in Job Group B (as defined in this paragraph), has one or more Years of Service, and incurs an Eligible Termination for any reason other than unsatisfactory performance, the Eligible Employee shall receive the higher of (i) 26 weeks of Salary or (ii) 2 weeks of Salary for each Year of Service. Job Group B consists of the following officer codes Vice President, Vice President-Senior Analyst, Vice President-Senior Compliance Officer, Country Head, and Director. 
 (c) If the Eligible Employee is employed in Job Group C (as defined in this paragraph), has one or more Years of Service, and incurs an Eligible Termination for any reason other than unsatisfactory performance, the Eligible Employee shall receive 52 weeks of Salary. Job Code C consists of the following officer codes Chief Executive Officer, Chief Executive Officer-Direct, Senior Managing Director, Group Managing Director, Managing Director, Associate Managing Director, Senior Director, and Senior Vice President. 
 The amount an Eligible Employee would have otherwise been entitled to receive under paragraphs 1(a) through (c) above shall be reduced by 50 if that Eligible Employee (i) incurs an Eligible Termination by reason of unsatisfactory performance, or (ii) has less than one Year of Service and incurs an Eligible Termination for any reason. The maximum payment payable under paragraph 1 shall be 52 weeks of Salary. 
 If an Eligible Employee serves in roles at two or more Participating Companies, the higher(est) officer code at such entities shall determine the Job Group for purposes hereof. The officer code assigned to an Eligible Employee shall be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion. 
 2. Payment Method. 
 Except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph 2 or as otherwise determined by the Company (in its sole discretion, but in all events consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code), the amounts payable under paragraph 1 shall be paid in a lump-sum as soon 

as practicable after the Severance and Release Agreement has been signed and the time for the Eligible Employee to revoke the Severance and Release Agreement, if any, has expired and the Severance and Release Agreement has become effective in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Eligible Employees employed as a Managing Director or higher and or employed in analytical roles (as determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, but in all events consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code), or for any other Eligible Employees the Company determines (in its sole discretion, but in all events consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code), the amounts payable under paragraph 1 shall be paid at the times the Eligible Employee's Salary would have been paid if employment had not terminated, over a period equal to the number of weeks of Salary to which such Eligible Employee is eligible under paragraph 1 salary continuation payments ). 
 If an Eligible Employee performs services for a Participating Company following an Eligible Termination, no payment shall be made under the Plan, and any salary continuation payments already commenced shall cease. For purposes of this Schedule A, to perform services shall mean employment or services as a full-time employee, consultant, owner, partner, associate, agent or otherwise on behalf of any person, principal, partnership, firm or corporation (other than a Participating Company). 
 3. Welfare Benefit Continuation. 
 Medical, dental, and vision benefits shall be provided during such number of weeks of Salary for which the Eligible Employee is eligible under paragraph 1 at the levels in effect for the Eligible Employee immediately prior to termination of employment, on the same basis as applicable to similarly-situated employees, provided that the Eligible Employee shall pay the employee portion of any required premium payments at the level in effect for employees generally of the Participating Company for such benefits. For purposes of determining an Eligible Employee's entitlement to continuation coverage as required by Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA (COBRA), such employee's 18-month or other period of coverage shall commence on his or her termination of employment. 
 4. Annual Bonus Payment.

Such bonus shall be payable in a lump-sum payment as soon as practicable after the Severance and Release Agreement has been signed and the time for the Eligible Employee to revoke the Severance and Release Agreement, if any, has expired and the Severance and Release Agreement has become effective in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amount shall be paid under this paragraph 4 in the event the Eligible Employee incurred an Eligible 

Termination by reason of unsatisfactory performance. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph 4 shall be appropriately modified in the case of any plan not on a calendar year basis. 
 5. Death.

 6. Other Benefits. 
 The Eligible Employee may be entitled to such outplacement services following a termination of employment as may be provided by, and in the sole discretion of, the Participating Company. 
 7. No Further Grants, Etc. 
 Following an Eligible Employee's termination of employment, no further grants, awards, contributions, accruals or continued participation (except as otherwise provided for herein) shall be made to or on behalf of such employee under any plan or program maintained by a Participating Company including, but not limited to, any qualified or nonqualified retirement, profit sharing, stock option or restricted stock plan of a Participating Company.

Schedule B 
 Claims Procedures 
 1. No Eligible Employee or beneficiary or other person or entity shall have any right or claim to benefits under the Plan, or any right or claim to payment from the Plan, except as specified herein.

In no event shall such extension exceed a period of 90 days from the end of such initial period. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render the benefit determination. 
 4. The period of time within which a benefit determination is required to be made shall begin at the time a claim is filed in accordance with these claim procedures without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a benefit determination accompanies the filing. 
 5. If the claim is denied in part or in full, written or electronic notice of denial shall be sent to the Claimant or his duly authorized representative. The written or electronic notice shall be set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant and include 
 (a) the specific reason or reasons for the denial 
 (b) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based

The Claimant shall be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the Claimant s claim for benefits.

 7. The Committee shall deliver the decision on review, in writing or electronic means, to the Claimant or his duly authorized representative not later than 60 days after the receipt of the request for such review, unless there are special circumstances (such as holding a hearing, if the Committee deems necessary), which require extensions of time for processing. If the Committee determines that an extension of time for processing is required, written or electronic notification of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 60-day period. In no event shall such extension exceed a period of 60 days from the end of the initial period. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Committee expects to render the determination on review. 
 8.

In the event that a period of time is extended due to Claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for making the benefit determination on review shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the Claimant until the date on which the Claimant responds to the request for additional information. 
 9. In the case of an adverse benefit determination on review, the Committee shall provide access to, and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to the Claimant s claim for benefits.
