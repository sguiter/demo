 (1) Includes million of reserves on multifamily bridge loans that we foreclosed on and took back the underlying collateral as real estate owned ("REO") assets at fair value. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a million and a million provision for credit losses on our structured portfolio, respectively. The additional provision for credit losses during both periods was primarily attributable to specifically impaired multifamily loans and the impact from the macroeconomic outlook of the commercial real estate market. Our estimate of allowance for credit losses on our structured portfolio, including related unfunded loan commitments, was based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period that reflects recent observable data, including changes in interest rates, unemployment forecasts, inflationary pressures, real estate values and other market factors. 
 The expected credit losses over the contractual period of our loans also include the obligation to extend credit through our unfunded loan commitments. Our current expected credit loss CECL allowance for unfunded loan commitments is adjusted quarterly and corresponds with the associated outstanding loans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding unfunded commitments of billion and billion, respectively, that we are obligated to fund as borrowers meet certain requirements.

 million and million, respectively, was excluded from the estimate of credit losses and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 All of our structured loans and investments are secured by real estate assets or by interests in real estate assets, and, as such, the measurement of credit losses may be based on the difference between the fair value of the underlying collateral and the carrying value of the assets as of the period end.

 (1) Represents the UPB of and impaired loans (less unearned revenue and other holdbacks and adjustments) by asset class at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 There were loans for which the fair value of the collateral securing the loan was less than the carrying value of the loan for which we had not recorded a provision for credit loss at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Non-performing Loans 
 Loans are classified as non-performing once the contractual payments exceed 60 days past due. Income from non-performing loans is generally recognized on a cash basis when it is received. Full income recognition will resume when the loan becomes contractually current, and performance has recommenced. At September 30, 2024, loans with an aggregate net carrying value of million, net of loan loss reserves of million, were classified as non-performing and, at December 31, 2023, loans with an aggregate net carrying value of million, net of related loan loss reserves of million, were classified as non-performing. 
 Commercial Retail Total 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had loans contractually past due greater than 60 days that are still accruing interest.

 ________________________ 
 (1) The modifications included bringing the loans current by paying past due interest owed (see Loan Modifications section below). 
 There were no non-accrual loans that were 60 days or less past due at September 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded million and million, respectively, of interest income on non-performing and other non-accrual loans. 
 In addition, we have loans with a carrying value totaling million at September 30, 2024, that are collateralized by a land development project. The loans do not carry a current pay rate of interest, however, of the loans with a carrying value totaling million entitle us to a weighted average accrual rate of interest of . In 2008, we suspended the recording of the accrual rate of interest on these loans, as they were impaired and we deemed the collection of this interest to be doubtful. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a cumulative allowance for credit losses of million related to these loans. The loans are subject to certain risks associated with a development project including, but not limited to, availability of construction financing, increases in projected construction costs, demand for the development s outputs upon completion of the project, and litigation risk. Additionally, these loans were not classified as non-performing as the borrower is compliant with all of the terms and conditions of the loans. 
 Loan Modifications 
 We may amend or modify loans that involve other-than-insignificant payment delays and provide interest rate reductions and/or extend the maturity dates for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty based on specific facts and circumstances. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we modified multifamily bridge loans with a total UPB of million. These loans included loans with a total UPB of million having interest rates with pricing over SOFR ranging from to and loan with a UPB of million with a fixed rate, and maturities between September 2024 to March 2026. As part of the modifications of each of these loans, borrowers invested additional capital to recapitalize their projects in exchange for temporary rate relief, which we provided through a pay and accrual feature. The capital invested by the borrowers was in the form of either, or a combination of: (1) additional deposits into interest, renovation and/or general reserves; (2) the purchase of a new rate cap; (3) a principal paydown of the loan; and (4) bringing any delinquent loans current by paying past due interest owed. In each case, we reduced the pay rate and deferred the remaining portion of the interest payable until payoff. The pay rates were amended to either SOFR, a spread over SOFR or a fixed rate, with the balance of the interest due under the original loan terms being deferred. At September 30, 2024, these modified loans had a weighted average pay rate of and a weighted average accrual rate of , and the pay rate on of these modified loans with a UPB of million increases from time-to-time throughout the loan maturities. Within these modifications there were: (1) loans with a total UPB of million and million that were greater than 60 days past due and 60 days or less past due at June 30, 2024, respectively, which are now current in accordance with their modified terms; (2) loans with a total UPB of million that have specific reserves totaling million at September 30, 2024; and (3) loans with a total UPB of million that also included a modification to extend the maturity between twelve and . 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we also modified an additional multifamily bridge loans with a total UPB of million. The modification terms required each borrower to invest additional capital in the form of either, or a combination of: (1) additional deposits into interest, renovation and/or general reserves; (2) the purchase of a new rate cap; (3) a principal paydown of the loan; and (4) bringing

 of these loans with a total UPB of million included extensions of twelve months. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we also modified a million loan that was greater than 60 days past due at June 30, 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a specific reserve of million on this loan. The third quarter modification bifurcated the loan into a million senior position with a pay rate of SOFR plus , a floor of and an accrual rate of SOFR plus , and a subordinated loan of million with a zero pay rate and an accrual rate of SOFR plus . Both of these loans were extended to a maturity of July 2026. In accordance with the modified loan terms, the borrower agreed to invest million of equity to fund interest, operating and general reserves and purchase a rate cap for the life of the loans with a strike price of . The million loan and the accrual rates on both loans, are subordinate to the new borrower equity plus a return on that capital, and, as such, we have not accrued the interest on those portions of the loans. In addition, we recorded an additional specific reserve of million at modification, for a total specific reserve of million at September 30, 2024, which fully reserves the subordinate loan. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we modified multifamily bridge loans with a total UPB of million. These loans contained interest rates with pricing over SOFR ranging from to and maturities between May 2024 to June 2025. As part of the modifications of each of these loans, borrowers invested additional capital to recapitalize their projects in exchange for temporary rate relief, which we provided through a pay and accrual feature. The capital invested by the borrowers was in the form of either, or a combination of: (1) additional deposits into interest and/or renovation reserves; (2) the purchase of a new rate cap; (3) a principal paydown of the loan and (4) bringing any delinquent loans current by paying past due interest owed. In each case, we reduced the pay rate and deferred the remaining portion of the interest payable until payoff. The pay rates were amended to either SOFR, a spread over SOFR or a fixed rate, with the balance of the interest due under the original loan terms being deferred.

Both of these loans were extended to a maturity date of April 2027. In accordance with the modified loan terms, the borrower agreed to invest million of equity to fund interest, renovation and operating reserves. The million loan and the accrual rates on both loans, are subordinate to the new borrower equity plus a return on that capital, and, as such, we decided not to accrue interest on these loans.

These loans contained interest rates with pricing over SOFR ranging from to and maturities between April 2024 to August 2025. As part of the modifications of each of these loans, borrowers invested additional capital to recapitalize their projects in exchange for temporary rate relief, which we provided through a pay and accrual feature. The capital invested by the borrowers was in the form of either, or a combination of: (1) additional deposits into interest and/or renovation reserves; (2) the purchase of a new rate cap; (3) a principal paydown of the loan and (4) bringing any delinquent loans current by paying past due interest owed. In each case, we reduced the pay rate and deferred the remaining portion of the interest payable until payoff. The pay rates were amended to either SOFR, a spread over SOFR or a fixed rate, with the balance of the interest due under the original loan terms being deferred. At March 31, 2024, these modified loans had a weighted average pay rate of and a weighted average accrual rate of .

 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we converted a first mortgage loan and a preferred equity investment in an office building to a common equity investment, which is classified as real estate owned and included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. On the date of the conversion, the investment had a net carrying value of million, net of an million reserve.

 In the second quarter of 2023, a borrower of a million multifamily bridge loan, with an interest rate of SOFR plus and a maturity date in September 2024, defaulted on its interest payments and, as a result, this loan was classified as a non-performing loan.

If the new borrower fails to timely complete the required capital improvements, it will be required to fund a renovation reserve at the lesser of: (1) million and (2) the difference between the million capital commitment and the costs actually incurred for such capital improvements. The key principal is also personally guaranteeing the million capital improvement. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had future funding commitments on modified loans with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty of million, which are generally subject to performance covenants that must be met by the borrower to receive funding. 
 All of the above modified loans were performing pursuant to their contractual terms at September 30, 2024, except for loans with a total UPB of million which were modified in the first and second quarters of 2024, which includes loans with a total UPB of million that were modified to provide temporary rate relief through a pay and accrual feature. Since these loans are not performing pursuant to their modified terms, these loans are classified as non-accrual loans. of these loans with a UPB of million have a specific loan loss reserve of million. The remaining loans with a total UPB of million have no specific reserves as the estimated fair value of the properties exceeded our carrying value at September 30, 2024.

Including certain fees and costs, the weighted average note rate was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Credit and Repurchase Facilities and Unsecured Debt. The credit and repurchase facilities and unsecured debt (senior and convertible notes) contain various financial covenants, including, but not limited to, minimum liquidity requirements, minimum net worth requirements, minimum unencumbered asset requirements, as well as certain other debt service coverage ratios, debt to equity ratios and minimum servicing portfolio tests. We were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions at September 30, 2024. 
 CLOs. Our CLO vehicles contain interest coverage and asset overcollateralization covenants that must be met as of the waterfall distribution date in order for us to receive such payments. If we fail these covenants in any of our CLOs, all cash flows from the applicable CLO would be diverted to repay principal and interest on the outstanding CLO bonds and we would not receive any residual payments until that CLO regained compliance with such tests. Our CLOs were in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2024, as well as on the most recent determination dates in October 2024. In the event of a breach of the CLO covenants that could not be cured in the near-term, we would be required to fund our non-CLO expenses, including employee costs, distributions required to maintain our REIT status, debt costs, and other expenses with (1) cash on hand, (2) income from any CLO not in breach of a covenant test, (3) income from real property and loan assets, (4) sale of assets, or (5) accessing the equity or debt capital markets, if available. We have the right to cure covenant breaches which would resume normal residual payments to us by purchasing non-performing loans out of the CLOs. However, we may not have sufficient liquidity available to do so at such time.

 ________________________ 
 (1) The overcollateralization ratio divides the total principal balance of all collateral in the CLO by the total principal balance of the bonds associated with the applicable ratio. To the extent an asset is considered a defaulted security, the asset s principal balance for purposes of the overcollateralization test is the lesser of the asset s market value or the principal balance of the defaulted asset multiplied by the asset s recovery rate which is determined by the rating agencies. Rating downgrades of CLO collateral will generally not have a direct impact on the principal balance of a CLO asset for purposes of calculating the CLO overcollateralization test unless the rating downgrade is below a significantly low threshold (e.g. CCC-) as defined in each CLO vehicle. 
 (2) The interest coverage ratio divides interest income by interest expense for the classes senior to those retained by us.

 Provisions for loss sharing Provisions reversal for loan repayments ) ) ) ) Recoveries (charge-offs), net ) Ending balance 
 When a loan is sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, we undertake an obligation to partially guarantee the performance of the loan. A liability is recognized for the fair value of the guarantee obligation undertaken for the non-contingent aspect of the guarantee and is removed only upon either the expiration or settlement of the guarantee. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of guarantee obligations included in the allowance for loss-sharing obligations. 
 In addition to and separately from the fair value of the guarantee, we estimate our allowance for loss-sharing under CECL over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk. The current expected loss related to loss-sharing was based on a collective pooling basis with similar risk characteristics, a reasonable and supportable forecast and a reversion period based on our average historical losses through the remaining contractual term of the portfolio. 
 When we settle a loss under the DUS loss-sharing model, the net loss is charged-off against the previously recorded loss-sharing obligation. The settled loss is often net of any previously advanced principal and interest payments in accordance with the DUS program, which are reflected as reductions to the proceeds needed to settle losses. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding advances of million and million, respectively, which were netted against the allowance for loss-sharing obligations. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our allowance for loss-sharing obligations, associated with expected losses under CECL, was million and million, respectively, and represented and , respectively, of our Fannie Mae servicing portfolio. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an increase in CECL reserves of million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an increase in CECL reserves of million and million, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the maximum quantifiable liability associated with our guarantees under the Fannie Mae DUS agreement was billion and billion, respectively. The maximum quantifiable liability is not representative of the actual loss we would incur. We would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans we service for Fannie Mae, for which we retain some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement.

See Note 13 for details. 
 Treasury Futures and Credit Default Swaps. We enter into over-the-counter treasury futures and credit default swaps to hedge our interest rate and credit risk exposure inherent in (1) our held-for-sale Agency Business Private Label loans from the time the loans are rate locked until sale or securitization, and (2) our Agency Business SFR fixed rate loans from the time the loans are originated until the time they can be financed with match term fixed rate securitized debt. Our treasury futures typically have a maturity and are tied to the and treasury rates. Our credit default swaps typically have a maturity, are tied to the credit spreads of the underlying bond issuers and we typically hold our position until we price our Private Label loan securitizations. These instruments do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, are cleared by a central clearing house and variation margin payments made in cash are treated as a legal settlement of the derivative itself. Our agreements with the counterparties provide for bilateral collateral pledging based on the counterparties' market value. The counterparties have the right to re-pledge the collateral posted, but have the obligation to return the pledged collateral as the market value of the treasury futures change. Our policy is to record the asset and liability positions on a net basis. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, included in others assets, which was comprised of cash posted as collateral of million and million, respectively, and net liability positions of less than million and million, respectively, from the fair value of our treasury futures. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded realized gains of million and unrealized losses of million to our Agency Business related to our swaps. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded realized losses of million and unrealized gains of million, to our Agency Business related to our swaps. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded realized and unrealized gains of million and million, respectively, to our Agency Business related to our swaps.

 Assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires judgment and we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter. Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows: 
 Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted and quoted prices exist in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such as government, agency and equity securities. 
 Level 2 Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data. Level 2 inputs may include quoted market prices for a similar asset or liability, interest rates and credit risk. Examples include non-government securities, certain mortgage and asset-backed securities, certain corporate debt and certain derivative instruments.

 days to days of loan funding, and are valued using pricing models that incorporate observable inputs from current market assumptions or a hypothetical securitization model utilizing observable market data from recent securitization spreads and observable pricing of loans with similar characteristics (Level 2). Fair value includes the fair value allocated to the associated future MSRs and is calculated pursuant to the valuation techniques described below for capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net (Level 3). 
 Capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net. Fair values are estimated using inputs based on discounted future net cash flow methodology (Level 3). MSRs are initially recorded at fair value and are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of MSRs is estimated using a process that involves the use of independent third-party valuation experts, supported by commercially available discounted cash flow models and analysis of current market data. The key inputs used in estimating fair value include the discount rate and contractually specified servicing fees, and to a lessor extent the prepayment speed of the underlying loans, annual per loan cost to service loans, delinquency rates, late charges and other economic factors. 
 Securities held-to-maturity, net. Fair values are approximated using inputs based on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities and are based on prevailing market data and, in some cases, are derived from third-party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions (Level 3). 
 Derivative financial instruments. Fair values of rate lock and forward sale commitments are estimated using valuation techniques, which include internally-developed models based on changes in the U.S. Treasury rate and other observable market data (Level 2). The fair value of rate lock commitments includes the fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loans, see capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net above for details on the applicable valuation technique (Level 3). We also consider the impact of counterparty non-performance risk when measuring the fair value of these derivatives. 
 Credit facilities, repurchase facilities and mortgage notes payable. Fair values for credit and repurchase facilities and mortgage notes payable of the Structured Business are estimated using discounted cash flow methodology, using discount rates, which, in our opinion, best reflect current market interest rates for financing with similar characteristics and credit quality (Level 3). The majority of our credit and repurchase facilities for the Agency Business bear interest at rates that are similar to those available in the market currently and fair values are estimated using Level 2 inputs. For these facilities, the fair values approximate their carrying values. 
 Securitized debt and junior subordinated notes. Fair values are estimated based on broker quotations, representing the discounted expected future cash flows at a yield that reflects current market interest rates and credit spreads (Level 3). 
 Senior unsecured notes. Fair values are estimated at current market quotes received from active markets when available (Level 1). If quotes from active markets are unavailable, then the fair values are estimated utilizing current market quotes received from inactive markets (Level 2). 
 Convertible senior unsecured notes. Fair values are estimated using current market quotes received from inactive markets (Level 2).

 (1) We had an allowance for credit losses of million related to impaired loans with a total carrying value, before loan loss reserves, of million at September 30, 2024. The fair values of these impaired loans are based on the value of the underlying collateral. 
 (2) We had unrealized impairment losses of million related to held-for-sale loans with a total carrying value, before unrealized impairment losses, of million. 
 Loan impairment assessments. Loans held-for-investment are intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees, loan purchase discounts, and net of the allowance for credit losses, when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired. We consider a loan impaired when, based upon current information, it is probable that all amounts due for both principal and interest will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We evaluate our loans to determine if the value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan, which may result in an allowance, and corresponding charge to the provision for credit losses, or an impairment loss. These valuations require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding capitalization and discount rates, revenue growth rates, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan and other factors. 
 Loans held-for-sale are generally expected to be transferred or sold within days to days of loan origination and are reported at lower of cost or market. We consider a loan classified as held-for-sale impaired if, based on current information, it is probable that we will sell the loan below par, or not be able to collect all principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. These loans are valued using pricing models that incorporate observable inputs from current market assumptions or a hypothetical securitization model utilizing observable market data from recent securitization spreads and observable pricing of loans with similar characteristics.

 million of liquid assets in one of our subsidiaries to meet our operational liquidity requirements for Fannie Mae and we had operational liquidity in excess of this requirement. 
 We are generally required to share the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program and are required to secure this obligation by assigning restricted cash balances and/or a letter of credit to Fannie Mae. The amount of collateral required by Fannie Mae is a formulaic calculation at the loan level by a Fannie Mae assigned tier, which considers the loan balance, risk level of the loan, age of the loan and level of risk-sharing. Fannie Mae requires restricted liquidity for Tier 2 loans of 75 basis points, 15 basis points for Tier 3 loans and 5 basis points for Tier 4 loans, which is funded over a period that begins upon delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae. A significant portion of our Fannie Mae DUS serviced loans for which we have risk sharing are Tier 2 loans. At September 30, 2024, the restricted liquidity requirement totaled million and was satisfied with a million letter of credit and cash issued to Fannie Mae. 
 At September 30, 2024, reserve requirements for the Fannie Mae DUS loan portfolio will require us to fund million in additional restricted liquidity over the next months, assuming no further principal paydowns, prepayments, or defaults within our at-risk portfolio. Fannie Mae periodically reassesses these collateral requirements and may make changes to these requirements in the future. We generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to meet these capital standards and do not expect any changes to have a material impact on our future operations; however, future changes to collateral requirements may adversely impact our available cash. 
 We are subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that we have entered into with secondary market investors. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in our inability to originate and service loans for the respective investor and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2024, we met all of Fannie Mae s quarterly capital requirements and our Fannie Mae adjusted net worth was in excess of the required net worth. We are not subject to capital requirements on a quarterly basis for Ginnie Mae and FHA, as requirements for these investors are only required on an annual basis. 
 As an approved designated seller/servicer under Freddie Mac s SBL program, we are required to post collateral to ensure that we are able to meet certain purchase and loss obligations required by this program. Under the SBL program, we are required to post collateral equal to million, which is satisfied with a million letter of credit.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements, and related notes and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements included herein. 
 
 Overview 
 Through our Structured Business, we invest in a diversified portfolio of structured finance assets in the multifamily, SFR and commercial real estate markets, primarily consisting of bridge loans, in addition to mezzanine loans, junior participating interests in first mortgages and preferred equity. We also invest in real estate-related joint ventures and may directly acquire real property and invest in real estate-related notes and certain mortgage-related securities. 
 Through our Agency Business, we originate, sell and service a range of multifamily finance products through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA and HUD. We retain the servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans we originate and sell under the GSE and HUD programs. We are an approved Fannie Mae DUS lender nationally, a Freddie Mac Multifamily Conventional Loan lender, seller/servicer in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, a Freddie Mac affordable, manufactured housing, senior housing and SBL lender, seller/servicer nationally and a HUD MAP and LEAN senior housing/healthcare lender nationally. We also originate and retain the servicing rights on permanent financing loans underwritten using the guidelines of our existing agency loans sold to the GSEs, which we refer to as Private Label loans and originate and sell finance products through CMBS programs. We either sell the Private Label loans instantaneously or pool and securitize them and sell certificates in the securitizations to third party investors, while retaining the highest risk bottom tranche certificate of the securitization. 
 We conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90 of its taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. 
 Our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors: 
 Net interest income earned on our investments. Net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. If the yield on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases, this will have a positive impact on earnings. However, if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases, this will have a negative impact on earnings. Net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio. We recognize the bulk of our net interest income from our Structured Business. Additionally, we recognize net interest income from loans originated through our Agency Business, which are generally sold within 60 days of origination. 
 Fees and other revenues recognized from originating, selling and servicing mortgage loans through the GSE and HUD programs. Revenue recognized from the origination and sale of mortgage loans consists of gains on sale of loans (net of any direct loan origination costs incurred), commitment fees, broker fees, loan assumption fees and loan origination fees. These gains and fees are collectively referred to as gain on sales, including fee-based services, net. We record income from MSRs at the time of commitment to the borrower, which represents the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the rights to service mortgage loans that we originate, with the recognition of a corresponding asset upon sale. We also record servicing revenue which consists of fees received for servicing mortgage loans, net of amortization on the MSR assets recorded. Although we have long-established relationships with the GSE and HUD agencies, our operating performance would be negatively impacted if our business relationships with these agencies deteriorate. Additionally, we also recognize revenue from originating, selling and servicing our Private Label loans. 
 One of our core business strategies is to generate additional agency lending opportunities by refinancing our multifamily balance sheet bridge loan portfolio when it is practical and appropriate to do so. We execute this strategy by underwriting the multifamily bridge loans we originate to a potential future agency financing. We then continue to work with our borrowers on this execution through the life cycle of the multifamily bridge loan. When effective, this strategy allows us to recapture refinancing opportunities, delever our balance sheet, and generate additional income streams through our capital-light Agency Business. 
 Income earned from our structured transactions. Our structured transactions are primarily comprised of investments in equity affiliates, which represent unconsolidated joint venture investments formed to acquire, develop and/or sell real estate-related assets. Operating results from these investments can be difficult to predict and can vary significantly period-to-period. When interest rates rise, the income from these investments can be significantly and negatively impacted, particularly from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business, since rising interest rates generally decrease the demand for residential real estate loans. In addition, we periodically receive distributions from our equity investments. It is difficult to forecast the timing of such payments, which can be substantial in any given quarter. We account for structured transactions within our Structured Business. 
 Credit quality of our loans and investments, including our servicing portfolio. Effective portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of our loan and investment and servicing portfolios. Maintaining the credit quality of the loans in our portfolios is of critical importance. Loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity.

Significant Developments During the Third Quarter of 2024 
 Financing and Capital Markets Activity. We entered into two new Structured Business debt facilities totaling 650.0 million of warehouse capacity. 
 Structured Business Activity. 
 We reduced our balance sheet portfolio by 3 to 11.57 billion, as loan runoff of 521.3 million outpaced loan originations totaling 258.5 million; and 
 We modified twenty-four loans with a total UPB of 1.15 billion. Borrowers of eighteen of these loans with a total UPB of 710.7 million invested additional capital to recapitalize their deals in exchange for temporary rate relief, which we provided through a pay and accrual feature. See Note 3 for details. 
 Agency Business Activity. 
 Loan originations totaled 1.10 billion and includes 383.1 million of new Agency loans that were recaptured from our Structured Business runoff; and 
 Grew our fee-based servicing portfolio 733.1 million, or 2 , to 33.01 billion. 
 Recent Developments in October 2024. Raised 100.0 million from the issuance of our 9.00 senior unsecured notes due 2027, and redeemed our 4.75 senior unsecured notes. 
 
 Current Market Conditions, Risks and Recent Trends 
 The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024, which marks the first rate cut since 2020, and it is possible that rates will continue to decline during the remainder of 2024 and 2025. Although rates have started to decline, we currently remain in a high interest rate environment which could remain higher for longer than expected if inflation and other economic indicators do not continue to meet the Federal Reserve s expectations. 
 Inflation, high interest rates, bank failures, and geopolitical uncertainty has caused significant disruptions in many market segments, including the financial services, real estate and credit markets, which has, and may continue, to result in a further dislocation in capital markets and a continual reduction of available liquidity. Despite these periodic disruptions, we have been successful in raising capital through various vehicles, when needed, to continue to operate and grow our business. 
 Instability in the banking sector, such as the multiple regional bank failures and consolidations, further contributed to the tightening liquidity conditions in the equity and capital markets and has affected the availability, and increased the cost of, capital. The increased cost of credit, or degradation in debt financing terms, has impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to identify and execute investments on attractive terms, or at all. Additionally, although the majority of our cash is currently on deposit with major financial institutions, our balances often exceed insured limits. We limit the exposure relating to these balances by diversifying them among various counterparties. Generally, deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained at financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore we believe bear minimal credit risk. 
 These current market conditions may continue to limit our ability to grow our Structured Business since this business is more reliant on the capital markets to grow, but can also present us with options to build on existing relationships or create new relationships with lenders. Runoff in our Structured Business also provides an opportunity to refinance these loans with new Agency loans, when practical and appropriate to do so. Since our Agency Business requires limited capital to grow, as originations are financed through warehouse facilities for generally up to 60 days before the loans are sold, tightening liquidity conditions in equity and capital markets should not have a substantial impact on our ability to sustain this business. 
 These adverse economic conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a dislocation in capital markets, declining real estate values of certain asset classes, increased payment delinquencies and defaults and increased loan modifications and foreclosures, all of which has impacted, and may continue to impact, our future results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We employ rigorous risk management and underwriting practices to proactively maintain the quality of our loan portfolio and work very closely with borrowers to mitigate potential losses, while safeguarding the integrity of our portfolio, which may include modifying original loan terms. Given the current elevated interest rate environment, we cannot guarantee that our loan portfolio will perform under the terms originally established. 
 Historically, the high interest rate environment has positively impacted our net interest income since our structured loan portfolio exceeds our corresponding debt balances and the vast majority of our loan portfolio is floating rate based on SOFR. Additionally, since a greater portion of our debt consists of fixed-rate instruments (such as convertible and senior unsecured notes), as compared to our structured loan portfolio, the increase in interest income from high interest rates tends to outpace the rise in interest expense on our debt. Furthermore, our earnings on escrows and cash balances also benefit from an elevated rate environment. However, the prolonged period of elevated interest

 rates has led to an increase in loan delinquencies, a decrease in loan originations and lower cash and escrow balances, which is having, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net interest income. Additionally, the prolonged high interest rate environment has contributed to a decline in certain commercial real estate values, leading to increased reserves, as the collateral value is insufficient to fully repay the loans. 
 As discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve began lowering interest rates in September 2024 and may continue to cut interest rates during the remainder of 2024 and 2025. If these rate reductions continue, this would likely lead to immediate decreases in net interest income on our floating rate loan book and reduce earnings on our cash and escrow balances. However, the prolonged rate reductions could also lead to increases in our loan originations and improved credit, resulting in decreases in delinquencies and potential future losses. For additional details, please see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk below. 
 We are a national originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. In November 2023, FHFA set its 2024 Caps for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at 70 billion for each enterprise for a total opportunity of 140 billion, which is a decrease from its 2023 Caps of 75 billion for each enterprise. FHFA stated they will continue to monitor the market and reserves the right to increase the 2024 Caps if warranted, however, they will not reduce the 2024 Caps if the market is smaller than initially projected. To promote affordable housing preservation, loans classified as supporting workforce housing properties will be exempt from the 2024 Caps. Workforce housing loans preserve rents at affordable levels in multifamily properties, typically without the use of public subsidies. The 2024 Caps will continue to mandate that at least 50 be directed towards mission driven, affordable housing, with affordability levels corresponding to 80 -120 of area median income, depending on the market. Our originations with the GSEs are highly profitable executions as they provide significant gains from the sale of our loans, non-cash gains related to MSRs, and servicing revenues. The current high interest rate environment could lead to a decline in our GSE originations, which could negatively impact our financial results. We are unsure whether FHFA will impose stricter limitations on GSE multifamily production volume in the future.

 Capitalized mortgage servicing rights decreased 14.9 million, primarily due to amortization and prepayment write-downs exceeding additions from new originations, as a result of a decline in the weighted average servicing fee rate. 
 I nvestments in equity affiliates decreased 3.0 million, primarily due to distributions received from our investments in AWC and a residential mortgage banking business totaling 19.0 million, substantially offset by contributions made in our investments in AWC and AMAC III totaling 16.3 million. 
 Real estate owned increased 40.9 million, primarily due to the foreclosure of two multifamily bridge loans, which we took back the underlying collateral, partially offset by the sale of an office property. 
 Due from related party increased 32.4 million, due to an increase in funds from payoffs to be remitted by our affiliated servicing operations related to real estate transactions at the end of the reporting period, which were remitted to us subsequent to quarter end. 
 Other assets increased 70.0 million, primarily due to additional fundings of unsecured line of credit loans totaling 39.6 million, an increase in interest receivables from fundings on existing loans and an increase in deferred interest on modified loans. 
 Liabilities Comparison of balances at September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023: 
 Credit and repurchase facilities increased 19.9 million, primarily due to refinancing loans from the unwind of CLOs in our Structured Business, substantially offset by loan sales exceeding originations in our Agency Business. 
 Securitized debt decreased 1.62 billion, primarily due to the unwind of CLO 15 and paydowns on our remaining securitizations. 
 Senior unsecured notes decreased 87.1 million, due to the repayment at maturity of our 5.75 notes. 
 Due to related party increased 11.7 million, due to the timing of loan payoffs, holdbacks and escrows to be remitted to our affiliated servicing operations. 
 Due to borrowers decreased 64.7 million, primarily due to the funding of previously committed originations in our Structured Business. 
 Other liabilities decreased 28.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in accrued interest payable as a result of the unwind of CLO 15, paydowns on remaining securitizations and interest payments made on our convertible notes, along with a decrease in deferred tax liabilities.

 (1) Prepayments reflect loans repaid prior to six months from the loan maturity. The majority of our loan servicing portfolio has a prepayment protection term and therefore, we may collect a prepayment fee which is included as a component of servicing revenue, net. See Note 5 for details. 
 (2) Delinquent loans reflect loans that are contractually 60 days or more past due. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, delinquent loans totaled 427.0 million and 411.1 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, there were two loans totaling 4.8 million in bankruptcy and three loans totaling 21.4 million have been foreclosed. At December 31, 2023, there were two loans totaling 4.8 million in bankruptcy and no loans in foreclosure. 
 Our Agency Business servicing portfolio represents commercial real estate loans, which are generally transferred or sold within 60 days from the date the loan is funded. Primarily all loans in our servicing portfolio are collateralized by multifamily properties. In addition, we are generally required to share in the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, see Note 11.

 (1) Based on UPB for loans, amortized cost for securities and principal amount of debt. 
 (2) Weighted average yield calculated based on annualized interest income or expense divided by average carrying value . 
 Net Interest Income 
 The decrease in interest income was mainly due to a 48.7 million decrease from our Structured Business. The decline was primarily from a decrease in the average balance of our core interest-earning assets as loan runoff exceeds loan originations, a decrease in the average yield on core interest-earning assets from a rise in non-performing and other non-accrued loans and a reduction in interest earned on cash balances due to lower average bank balances. 
 The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to a 30.1 million decrease from our Structured Business, primarily due to a decline in the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities from loan runoff and note paydowns in our securitizations and senior unsecured notes, partially offset by an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, mainly from increases in SOFR. 
 Agency Business Revenue 
 The decrease in income from MSRs was primarily due to a 13 decrease in loan commitment volume 154.9 million), partially offset by an 8 increase in the MSR rate from 1.16 to 1.25 . The increase in the MSR rate was primarily due to higher rates on Fannie Mae loan volume from an increase in servicing fees retained. 
 The decrease in servicing revenue, net was primarily due to a decrease in the average escrow balances largely due to runoff, partially offset by an increase in interest rates. 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 The gains and losses on derivative instruments relate to changes in the fair values of forward sale commitments and swaps held by our Agency Business as a result of changes in market interest rates as well as from the timing of GSE Agency loan sales. 
 Other income, net in 2024 primarily reflects loan origination and modification fees from our Structured Business and reserve recoveries on SFR and Private Label loans from our Agency Business. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 Other Expenses 
 The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and commissions from higher bonus allocation targets, annual merit increases and commission rates. 
 The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in professional and legal costs. 
 The increase in the provision for loss sharing (net of recoveries) primarily reflects an increase in reserves related to general economic and market conditions. 
 The provision for credit losses (net of recoveries) in 2024 includes 13.9 million in specific loan reserves and a 1.4 million increase related to forecasted economic and market conditions, while 2023 includes 12.8 million in specific loan reserves and a 4.5 million increase related to forecasted economic and market conditions. 
 Income from Equity Affiliates 
 Income from equity affiliates in 2024 primarily reflects a 4.9 million distribution received from our Lexford joint venture, partially offset by losses from our investments in a residential mortgage banking business and our AMAC III investment totaling 1.5 million, while income in 2023 primarily reflects 3.5 million received from an equity participation interest on a property that was sold, substantially offset by an aggregate loss of 2.7 million from our ongoing equity investments. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a tax provision of 5.2 million, which consisted of a current tax provision of 7.2 million and a deferred tax benefit of 2.0 million. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a tax provision of 5.9 million, which consisted of a current tax provision of 8.3 million and a deferred tax benefit of 2.4 million. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
 The noncontrolling interest relates to the outstanding OP Units (see Note 16). There were 16,293,589 OP Units outstanding at both September 30, 2024 and 2023, which represented 8.0 of our outstanding stock at both September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Net Interest Income 
 The decrease in interest income was mainly due to a 98.2 million decrease from our Structured Business. The decline was primarily from a decrease in the average balance of our core interest-earning assets as loan runoff exceeded loan originations, slightly offset by an increase in the average yield on core interest-earning assets from an increase in SOFR, partially offset by a rise in non-performing and other non-accrued loans. 
 The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to a 50.2 million decrease from our Structured Business, primarily due to a decline in the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities from loan runoff and note paydowns in our securitizations and senior unsecured notes, partially offset by an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, mainly from increases in SOFR. 
 Agency Business Revenue 
 The decrease in gain on sales, including fee-based services, net was primarily due to an 8 decrease in loan sales volume 279.2 million), partially offset by a 3 increase in the sales margin from 1.54 to 1.58 . 
 The decrease in income from MSRs was primarily due to a 20 decrease in loan commitment volume 754.3 million) and a 3 decrease in the MSR rate from 1.27 to 1.23 . The decrease in the MSR rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of Freddie Mac loan commitments, which contain lower servicing fees. 
 The decrease in servicing revenue, net was primarily due to a decrease in average escrow balances largely due to runoff, partially offset by an increase in interest rates. 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 The losses on derivative instruments in 2024 and 2023 were related to changes in the fair values of our forward sale commitments and swaps held by our Agency Business as a result of changes in market interest rates as well as from the timing of GSE Agency loan sales.

Table of Contents 

 The increase in other income, net was primarily from an increase in loan origination and modification fees from our Structured Business 
 Other Expenses 
 The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and commissions from higher bonus allocation targets, annual merit increases and commission rates. 
 The decrease in the provision for loss sharing (net of recoveries) reflects less specific loan impairment reserves taken in the current year period as well as a decrease in general reserves. 
 The increase in the provision for credit losses (net of recoveries) primarily reflects an increase in reserves on specifically impaired loans due to a decline in general economic and market conditions. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 The loss on extinguishment of debt in both 2024 and 2023 reflects deferred financing fees recognized in connection with the unwind of CLOs. 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate 
 In 2024, we sold a real estate owned asset for 14.2 million and recognized a 3.8 million gain. 
 Income from Equity Affiliates 
 Income from equity affiliates in 2024 primarily reflects 9.0 million in distributions received from our Lexford joint venture, partially offset by a 1.7 million loss from our AMAC III investment, while income in 2023 primarily reflects 14.5 million received from equity participation interests on properties that were sold and 7.2 million in distributions received from our Lexford joint venture. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a tax provision of 12.7 million, which consisted of a current tax provision of 21.6 million and a deferred tax benefit of 8.9 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a tax provision of 19.4 million, which consisted of a current tax provision of 26.0 million and a deferred tax benefit of 6.6 million.

 The noncontrolling interest relates to the outstanding OP Units (see Note 16). There were 16,293,589 OP Units outstanding at both September 30, 2024 and 2023, which represented 8.0 of our outstanding stock at both September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity. Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, satisfaction of collateral requirements under the Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing agreement and, as an approved designated seller/servicer of Freddie Mac s SBL program, operational liquidity requirements of the GSE agencies, fund new loans and investments, fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders, as well as other general business needs. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity and debt offerings, proceeds from CLOs and securitizations, debt facilities and cash flows from operations. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe our existing sources of funds and access to additional liquidity will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs. 
 The ongoing adverse economic and market conditions, including inflation, high interest rate environment, bank failures and geopolitical uncertainty, continues to cause significant disruptions and liquidity constraints in many market segments, including the financial services, real estate and credit markets. These conditions have created, and may continue to create, a dislocation in capital markets and a continual reduction of available liquidity. Instability in the banking sector, such as the regional bank failures and consolidations, further contributed to the tightening liquidity conditions in the equity and capital markets and has affected the availability and increased the cost of capital. The increased cost of credit, or degradation in debt financing terms, may impact our ability to identify and execute investments on attractive terms, or at all. If our financing sources, borrowers and their tenants continue to be impacted by these adverse economic and market conditions, or by the other risks disclosed in our filings with the SEC, it would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. 
 As described in Note 10, certain of our repurchase facilities include margin call provisions associated with changes in interest spreads which are designed to limit the lenders credit exposure. If we experience significant decreases in the value of the properties serving as collateral under these repurchase agreements, which is set by the lenders based on current market conditions, the lenders have the right to require us to repay all, or a portion, of the funds advanced, or provide additional collateral. While we expect to extend or renew all of our facilities as they mature, we cannot provide assurance that they will be extended or renewed on as favorable terms.

Table of Contents 

 We had 9.97 billion in total structured debt outstanding at September 30, 2024. Of this total, 7.02 billion, or 70 , does not contain mark-to-market provisions and is comprised of non-recourse securitized debt, senior unsecured debt and junior subordinated notes. The remaining 2.95 billion of debt is in credit and repurchase facilities with several different banks that we have long-standing relationships with. At September 30, 2024, we had 1.51 billion of debt from credit and repurchase facilities that were subject to margin calls related to changes in interest spreads. 
 At October 30, 2024, we had approximately 600 million in cash and liquidity. In addition to our ability to extend our credit and repurchase facilities and raise funds from equity and debt offerings, we also have a 33.01 billion agency servicing portfolio at September 30, 2024, which is mostly prepayment protected and generates approximately 125.4 million per year in recurring gross cash flow. 
 To maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income. These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. However, we believe that our capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital and liquidity requirements. 
 Cash Flows. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 414.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of net cash inflows of 220.3 million from loan sales exceeding loan originations in our Agency Business and net income (adjusted for the increase in CECL reserves of 72.7 million) of 281.3 million, partially offset by a 32.4 million increase in funds from payoffs due from our affiliated servicing operations. 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities totaled 946.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loan and investment activity (originations and payoffs/paydowns) comprise the majority of our investing activities. Loan payoffs and paydowns from our Structured Business totaling 1.87 billion, net of originations of 912.5 million, resulted in net cash inflows of 961.4 million. 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities totaled 2.03 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of 1.63 billion of payoffs and paydowns on existing securitizations, 295.9 million of distributions to our stockholders and OP Unit holders and 90.0 million from the repayment at maturity of our 5.75 senior unsecured notes. 
 Agency Business Requirements. The Agency Business is subject to supervision by certain regulatory agencies. Among other things, these agencies require us to meet certain minimum net worth, operational liquidity and restricted liquidity collateral requirements, purchase and loss obligations and compliance with reporting requirements. Our adjusted net worth and operational liquidity exceeded the agencies requirements at September 30, 2024. Our restricted liquidity and purchase and loss obligations were satisfied with letters of credit totaling 75.0 million and cash. See Note 14 for details about our performance regarding these requirements. 
 We also enter into contractual commitments with borrowers providing rate lock commitments while simultaneously entering into forward sale commitments with investors. These commitments are outstanding for short periods of time (generally less than 60 days) and are described in Note 12. 
 Debt Facilities. We maintain various forms of short-term and long-term financing arrangements. Borrowings underlying these arrangements are primarily secured by a significant amount of our loans and investments and substantially all our loans held-for-sale. The following is a summary of our debt facilities in thousands): 
 Debt Instruments September 30, 2024 Commitment UPB (1) Available Maturity Dates (2) Structured Business Credit and repurchase facilities 7,111,982 2,944,463 4,167,519 2024 - 2027 Securitized debt (3) 5,327,245 5,327,245 2024 - 2027 Senior unsecured notes 1,255,000 1,255,000 2024 - 2028 Convertible senior unsecured notes 287,500 287,500 2025 Junior subordinated notes 154,336 154,336 2034 - 2037 Structured Business total 14,136,063 9,968,544 4,167,519 Agency Business Credit and repurchase facilities (4) 1,700,333 319,570 1,380,763 2024 - 2026 Consolidated total 15,836,396 10,288,114 5,548,282

 (3) Maturity dates represent the weighted average remaining maturity based on the underlying collateral at September 30, 2024. 
 (4) The ASAP agreement we have with Fannie Mae has no expiration date. 
 We utilize our credit and repurchase facilities primarily to finance our loan originations on a short-term basis prior to loan securitizations, including through CLOs. The timing, size and frequency of our securitizations impact the balances of these borrowings and produce some fluctuations. The following table provides additional information regarding the balances of our borrowings (in thousands): 
 Quarter Ended Quarterly Average UPB End of Period UPB Maximum UPB at Any Month End September 30, 2024 3,082,185 3,264,033 3,299,414 June 30, 2024 3,078,714 3,167,067 3,280,998 March 31, 2024 3,010,216 2,921,206 3,132,279 December 31, 2023 3,274,139 3,242,938 3,251,330 September 30, 2023 3,432,725 3,398,451 3,463,825 
 Our debt facilities, including their restrictive covenants, are described in Note 10. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Inflation. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024, which marks the first rate cut since 2020, and it is possible that rates will continue to decline during the remainder of 2024 and 2025. Although rates have started to decline, we currently remain in a high interest rate environment which could remain higher for longer than expected if inflation and other economic indicators do not continue to meet the Federal Reserve s expectations. If these rate reductions continue, this would likely lead to immediate decreases in net interest income on our floating rate loan book and reduce earnings on our cash and escrow balances. However, if a prolonged rate cut occurs, this could lead to increases in our loan origination business and improved credit, resulting in decreases in delinquencies and potential future losses. For additional details, please see Current Market Conditions, Risks and Recent Trends above and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk below. 
 Contractual Obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the following significant changes were made to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report: 
 
 Modified existing debt facilities, resulting in a net 350.0 million increase in the committed amount of these facilities; 
 Entered into three new debt facilities totaling 900.0 million; 
 Unwound CLO 15 repaying 674.4 million of outstanding notes; 
 Paid down outstanding notes on CLOs 14 and 16 and Q Series securitization totaling 954.6 million; and 
 Repaid at maturity the remaining 90.0 million of our 5.75 senior notes. 
 Refer to Note 14 for a description of our debt maturities by year and unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 We enter into derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage the potential loss exposure caused by fluctuations of interest rates. See Note 12 for details. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Please refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of our critical accounting policies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to these policies. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings. We are presenting distributable earnings because we believe it is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and is useful to investors, analysts and other parties in the evaluation of REITs and their ability to provide dividends to stockholders. Dividends are one of the principal reasons investors invest in REITs. To maintain REIT status, REITs are required to distribute at least 90 of their taxable income. We consider distributable earnings in determining our quarterly dividend and believe that, over time, distributable earnings is a useful indicator of our dividends per share. 
 We define distributable earnings as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for accounting items such as depreciation and amortization (adjusted for unconsolidated joint ventures), non-cash stock-based compensation expense, income from MSRs, amortization and write-offs of MSRs, gains/losses on derivative instruments primarily associated with Private Label loans not yet sold and securitized, changes in fair value of GSE-related derivatives that temporarily flow 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 through earnings, deferred tax provision (benefit), CECL provisions for credit losses (adjusted for realized losses as described below), and gains/losses on the receipt of real estate from the settlement of loans (prior to the sale of the real estate). We also add back one-time charges such as acquisition costs and one-time gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and redemption of preferred stock. 
 We reduce distributable earnings for realized losses in the period we determine that a loan is deemed nonrecoverable in whole or in part. Loans are deemed nonrecoverable upon the earlier of: (1) when the loan receivable is settled (i.e., when the loan is repaid, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying asset is sold); or (2) when we determine that it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The realized loss amount is equal to the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the book value of the asset. 
 Distributable earnings is not intended to be an indication of our cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or a measure of our liquidity, nor is it entirely indicative of funding our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our calculation of distributable earnings may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 
 Distributable earnings are as follows in thousands, except share and per share data): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income attributable to common stockholders 58,175 77,924 163,445 238,407 Adjustments: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 5,028 6,789 14,119 21,200 Income from mortgage servicing rights (13,195) (14,109) (37,928) (48,769) Deferred tax benefit (2,026) (2,433) (8,922) (6,630) Amortization and write-offs of MSRs 18,792 18,757 56,728 58,684 Depreciation and amortization 2,564 3,957 8,802 12,310 Loss on extinguishment of debt 314 412 1,561 Provision for credit losses, net 17,077 16,922 63,337 57,437 (Gain) loss on derivative instruments, net (1,217) 1,002 4,677 2,036 Stock-based compensation 2,977 3,047 11,748 12,141 Distributable earnings (1) 88,175 112,170 276,418 348,377 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding - GAAP (1) 205,347,309 221,328,818 205,448,479 217,457,399 Less: Convertible notes dilution (17,312,382) (17,271,419) Diluted weighted average shares outstanding - distributable earnings (1) 205,347,309 204,016,436 205,448,479 200,185,980 Diluted distributable earnings per share (1) 0.43 0.55 1.35 1.74

 (1) Amounts are attributable to common stockholders and OP Unit holders. The OP Units are redeemable for cash, or at our option for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We disclosed a quantitative and qualitative analysis regarding market risk in Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report. That information is supplemented by the information included above in Item 2 of this report. Other than the developments described thereunder, there have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk since December 31, 2023. 
 The following table projects the potential impact on interest (in thousands) for a 12-month period, assuming a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of 50 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points in corresponding interest rates. Since it is unlikely that interest 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 rates will significantly increase in the near future as a result of the current high interest rate environment, we have excluded the impact of a 100 basis point increase in corresponding interest rates. 
 Assets (Liabilities) Subject to Interest Rate Sensitivity (1) 50 Basis Point Increase 50 Basis Point Decrease 100 Basis Point Decrease Interest income from loans and investments 11,565,538 47,329 (46,214) (91,100) Interest expense from debt obligations (9,968,544) 42,333 (42,333) (84,627) Impact to net interest income from loans and investments 4,996 (3,881) (6,473) Interest income from cash, restricted cash and escrow balances (2) 2,335,446 11,677 (11,677) (23,354) Total impact from hypothetical changes in interest rates 16,673 (15,558) (29,827) 
 ________________________ 
 (1) Represents the UPB of our structured loan portfolio, the principal balance of our debt and the account balances of our cash, restricted cash and escrows at September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Our cash, restricted cash and escrows are currently earning interest at a weighted average blended rate of approximately 4.6 , or approximately 110 million annually. Interest income earned on our cash and restricted cash is included as a component of interest income and interest income earned on escrows is included as a component of servicing revenue, net in the consolidated statements of income. The interest earned on our cash, restricted cash and escrows is based on an average daily balance and may be different from the end of period balance. 
 We entered into treasury futures to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates inherent in (1) our held-for-sale Agency Business Private Label loans from the time the loans are rate locked until sale and securitization, and (2) our Agency Business SFR fixed rate loans from the time the loans are originated until the time they can be financed with match term fixed rate securitized debt. Our treasury futures are tied to the five-year and ten-year treasury rates and hedge our exposure to Private Label loans, until the time they are securitized, and changes in the fair value of our held-for-sale Agency Business SFR fixed rate loans. A 50 basis point and a 100 basis point increase to the five-year and ten-year treasury rates on our treasury futures held at September 30, 2024 would have resulted in a gain of 0.2 million and 0.5 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while a 50 basis point and a 100 basis point decrease in the rates would have resulted in a loss of 0.4 million and 0.8 million, respectively. 
 Our Agency Business originates, sells and services a range of multifamily finance products with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD. Our loans held-for-sale to these agencies are not currently exposed to interest rate risk during the loan commitment, closing and delivery process. The sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated prior to closing on the loan with the borrower, and the sale or placement is generally effectuated within 60 days of closing. The coupon rate for the loan is set after we establish the interest rate with the investor. 
 In addition, the fair value of our MSRs is subject to market risk since a significant driver of the fair value of these assets is the discount rates. A 100 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate would decrease the fair value of our MSRs by 15.0 million at September 30, 2024, while a 100 basis point decrease would increase the fair value by 15.8 million. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30, 2024. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not involved in any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 In March 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to 50.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The repurchase of our common stock may be made from time to time in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, based on our stock price, general market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. In December 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the remaining availability under the share repurchase program to 150.0 million. At September 30, 2024, there was 138.6 million available for repurchase under this program. The program may be discontinued or modified at any time. 
 There were no purchases made by, or on behalf of us, under this plan or by any "affiliated purchaser," as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the period covered by this report, no Arbor director or officer , modified or any "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
