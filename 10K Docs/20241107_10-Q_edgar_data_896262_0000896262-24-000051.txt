SPECIAL CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 When included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or in other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC or in statements made by or on behalf of the Company, words like believes, belief, expects, strategy, plans, anticipates, intends, projects, estimates, may, might, will, could, would, should and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described therein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: disruption from the proposed merger with UnitedHealth Group with patient, payor, provider, referral source, supplier or management and employee relationships; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement with UnitedHealth Group or the inability to complete the proposed transaction on the anticipated terms and timetable; the risk that necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed merger with UnitedHealth Group are delayed, are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the failure of the conditions to the proposed merger to be satisfied; the costs related to the proposed merger; the diversion of management time on merger-related issues; the risk that termination fees may be payable by the Company in the event that the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances; reputational risk related to the proposed merger; the risk of litigation or regulatory action related to the proposed merger; changes in Medicare and other medical payment levels; changes in payments and covered services by federal and state governments; future cost containment initiatives undertaken by third-party payors; changes in the episodic versus non-episodic mix of our payors, the case mix of our patients and payment methodologies; staffing shortages driven by the competitive labor market; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; competition in the healthcare industry; our ability to maintain or establish new patient referral sources; changes in or our failure to comply with existing federal and state laws or regulations or the inability to comply with new government regulations on a timely basis; changes in estimates and judgments associated with critical accounting policies; our ability to consistently provide high-quality care; our ability to keep our patients and employees safe; our access to financing; our ability to meet debt service requirements and comply with covenants in debt agreements; business disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters, climate change or acts of terrorism, widespread protests or civil unrest; our ability to open care centers, acquire additional care centers and integrate and operate these care centers effectively; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, investments and joint ventures; our ability to integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure; the impact of inflation; and changes in laws or developments with respect to any litigation relating to the Company, including various other matters, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of future events. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking, and we do not intend to release publicly any updates or changes in our expectations concerning the forward-looking statements or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any forward-looking statement may be based, except as required by law. For a discussion of some of the factors discussed above as well as additional factors, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, particularly, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors therein, and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additional risk factors may also be described in reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.

 Home Health Revenue Recognition 
 Medicare Revenue 
 All Medicare contracts are required to have a signed plan of care which represents a single performance obligation, comprised of the delivery of a series of distinct services that are substantially similar and have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. Accordingly, we account for the series of services ("episode") as a single performance obligation satisfied over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the goods and services provided. An episode starts the first day a billable visit is performed and ends 60 days later or upon discharge, if earlier, with multiple continuous episodes allowed. Each -day episode includes two -day periods of care. 
 Net service revenue is recorded based on the established Federal Medicare home health payment rate for a -day period of care. ASC 606 notes that if an entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the entity s performance completed to date, the entity may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. We have elected to apply the "right to invoice" practical expedient, and therefore, our revenue recognition is based on the reimbursement we are entitled to for each -day period of care. We utilize our historical average length of stay for each -day period of care as the measure of progress towards the satisfaction of our performance obligation. 
 The Patient-Driven Groupings Model ("PDGM") uses timing, admission source, functional impairment levels and principal and other diagnoses to case-mix adjust payments. The case-mix adjusted payment for a -day period of care is subject to additional adjustments based on certain variables, including, but not limited to (a) an outlier payment if our patient's care was unusually costly (capped at of total reimbursement per provider number); (b) a low utilization payment adjustment LUPA if the number of visits provided was less than the established threshold, which ranges from to visits and varies for every case-mix group; (c) a partial payment if a patient is transferred to another provider or from another provider before completing the -day period of care; and (d) the applicable geographic wage index. Payments for routine and non-routine supplies are included in the -day payment rate. 
 Medicare can also make various adjustments to payments received if we are unable to produce appropriate billing documentation or acceptable authorizations. We estimate the impact of such adjustments based on our historical collection experience, which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over on Medicare claims, and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered to revenue with a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable. 
 Amounts due from Medicare include variable consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlements of audits and payment reviews. We determine our estimates for non-contractual revenue adjustments related to audits and payment reviews based on our historical experience and success rates in the claim appeals and adjudication process.

 of our managed care contract volume affords us the opportunity to receive additional payments if we achieve certain quality or process metrics as defined in each contract (e.g. star ratings and acute-care hospitalization rates). We record revenue associated with these metrics at the time the amounts are probable and estimable. 
 Episodic-based Revenue. We recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize Medicare revenue for amounts that are paid by other insurance carriers, including Medicare Advantage programs; however, these amounts can vary based upon the negotiated terms, the majority of which range from to of Medicare rates. 
 Non-episodic based Revenue. For our per visit contracts, gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per-visit rates. For our case rate contracts, gross revenue is recorded over our historical average length of stay using the established case rate for each admission. Contractual revenue adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realized from patients, third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue. We also make non-contractual revenue adjustments to non-episodic revenue based on our historical experience to reflect the estimated transaction price. We receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self-insured or are obligated for an insurance co-payment. 
 Under our case rate contracts, we may receive reimbursement before all services are rendered. Any cash received that exceeds the associated revenue earned is recorded to deferred revenue in accrued expenses within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Hospice Revenue Recognition 
 Hospice Medicare Revenue 
 Gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates. The estimated payment rates are predetermined daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver. The four levels of care are routine care, general inpatient care, continuous home care and respite care. Routine care accounted for of our total Medicare hospice service revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There are two separate payment rates for routine care: payments for the first 60 days of care and care beyond 60 days. In addition to the two routine rates, we may also receive a service intensity add-on SIA ). The SIA is based on visits made in the last seven days of life by a registered nurse or medical social worker for patients in a routine level of care. 
 The performance obligation is the delivery of hospice services to the patient, as determined by a physician, each day the patient is on hospice care. 
 We make adjustments to Medicare revenue for non-contractual revenue adjustments, which include our inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or acceptable authorizations and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. We estimate the impact of these non-contractual revenue adjustments based on our historical collection experience, which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over on Medicare claims, and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered to revenue with a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable. 
 Amounts due from Medicare include variable consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlements of audits and payment reviews. We determine our estimates for non-contractual revenue adjustments related to audits and payment reviews based on our historical experience and success rates in the claim appeals and adjudication process.

 million for estimated amounts due back to Medicare in accrued expenses for the Federal cap years ended September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had recorded million for estimated amounts due back to Medicare in accrued expenses for the Federal cap years ended September 30, 2017 through September 30, 2024. 
 Hospice Non-Medicare Revenue 
 Gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per day rates, as applicable. Contractual revenue adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contractual rates to be realized from patients, third-party payors and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue. We also make non-contractual adjustments to non-Medicare revenue based on our historical experience to reflect the estimated transaction price. 
 Personal Care Revenue Recognition 
 Personal Care Revenue 
 For the periods prior to the divestiture of our personal care line of business on March 31, 2023, we generated net service revenue by providing our services directly to patients based on authorized hours, visits or units determined by the relevant agency, at a rate that was either contractual or fixed by legislation. Net service revenue was recognized at the time services were rendered based on gross charges for the services provided, reduced by estimates for contractual and non-contractual revenue adjustments. We received payment for providing such services from payors, including state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Payors included the following elder service agencies: Aging Services Access Points ("ASAPs"), Senior Care Options ("SCOs"), Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly ("PACE") and the Veterans Administration ("VA"). 
 High Acuity Care Revenue Recognition 
 High Acuity Care Revenue 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from contracts with health insurance plans for the coordination and provision of home recovery care services to clinically-eligible patients who are enrolled members in those insurance plans, contracts with health system partners for the coordination and provision of home recovery care services to clinically-eligible patients who are discharged early from a health system facility to complete their inpatient stay at home and contracts to provide palliative care at home services to clinically-eligible patients. 
 Under our health insurance plan contracts, we provide home recovery care services, which include hospital-equivalent ("H@H") and skilled nursing facility ("SNF") equivalent services ("SNF@H"), for high acuity care patients on a full risk basis whereby we assume the financial risk for the coordination and payment of all hospital or SNF replacement medical services necessary to treat the medical condition for which the patient was diagnosed in a home-based setting for a -day (H@H) or -day (SNF@H) episode of care in exchange for a fixed contracted bundled rate. For H@H programs, the fixed rate is based on the assigned diagnosis related group ("DRG") and the -day post-discharge related spend. For SNF@H programs, the fixed rate is based on the -day post-discharge related spend. Our performance obligation is the coordination and provision of patient care in accordance with physicians orders over either a -day or -day episode of care. The majority of our care coordination services and direct patient care is provided in the first five to seven days of the episode period (the "acute phase"). Monitoring services and follow-up direct patient care, as deemed necessary by the treating physician, are provided throughout the remainder of the episode. Since the majority of our services are provided during the acute phase, we recognize net service revenue over the acute phase based on gross charges for the services provided per the applicable managed care contract rates, reduced by estimates for revenue adjustments. 
 
 Under our contracts with health system partners, we provide home recovery care services for high acuity patients on a limited risk basis whereby we assume the risk for certain healthcare services during the remainder of an inpatient acute stay serviced at the patient s home (completing H@H - "CH@H") in exchange for a contracted per diem rate. The performance obligation is the

During the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, all funds held in escrow related to the personal care line of business divestiture were released to Amedisys. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, all funds held in escrow related to the Evolution Health LLC acquisition were released either to third parties or to Amedisys.

 of our total outstanding patient receivables (approximately ). Thus, we believe there are no other significant concentrations of receivables that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our patient accounts receivable. We write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and deem an account to be uncollectible. We believe the collectability risk associated with our Medicare accounts, which represented and of our patient accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is limited due to our historical collection rate of over from Medicare and the fact that Medicare is a U.S. government payor. 
 We do not believe there are any significant concentrations of revenues from any payor that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our accounts receivable. 
 Prior to February 2024, the Company exclusively utilized Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to Medicare and all other payors for reimbursement. On February 22, 2024, UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare s information technology systems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations; however, we were delayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors which resulted in a reduction in our operating cash flow and an increase in our accounts receivable during the first and second quarters. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we were able to quickly redirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. As of September 30, 2024, we have resolved

 The Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement. These closing conditions include, among others, (i) approval by Amedisys stockholders at the Amedisys Stockholders Meeting (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which approval was obtained on September 8, 2023; (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the receipt of the required state regulatory approvals; (iv) the absence of any law or order that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the Merger; and (v) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under all applicable antitrust laws without the imposition by any governmental entity of any term, condition, obligation, requirement, limitation, prohibition, remedy, sanction or other action that has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement). 
 On June 28, 2024, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group and certain of their respective subsidiaries entered into an agreement relating to the sale of certain Amedisys home health care centers and certain UnitedHealth Group care centers to VCG Luna, LLC, an affiliate of VitalCaring Group (the "Divestiture"). Consummation of the Divestiture is contingent on a number of conditions, including the consummation of the Merger, which itself is subject to a number of conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Amedisys and UnitedHealth Group continue to work cooperatively with the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") staff in their review of the Merger, but Amedisys cannot be certain as to when the DOJ's review will be completed or the outcome of that review. 
 Termination of Option Care Health, Inc. ("OPCH") Merger Agreement 
 As previously disclosed in Amedisys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2023 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 4, 2023, Amedisys entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on May 3, 2023 (the OPCH Merger Agreement with OPCH, a Delaware corporation, and Uintah Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of OPCH OPCH Merger Sub ). On June 26, 2023, Amedisys, OPCH and OPCH Merger Sub entered into the Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement ), pursuant to which the parties thereto agreed to terminate the OPCH Merger Agreement and grant mutual releases by the parties of all claims against the other parties based upon, arising from, in connection with or relating to the OPCH Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, each of the termination of the OPCH Merger Agreement and the mutual releases provided for in the Termination Agreement would become effective upon receipt by OPCH of a termination fee payable by, or on behalf of, Amedisys within 24 hours of the execution of the Termination Agreement (i.e., before the market open on June 27, 2023). On June 26, 2023, following the execution of the Termination Agreement, UnitedHealth Group, on behalf of Amedisys, delivered funds to OPCH in an amount equal to , representing the termination fee payable to OPCH under the OPCH Merger Agreement and the Termination Agreement, satisfying the condition precedent to the effectiveness of the termination of the OPCH Merger Agreement and the releases contained in the Termination Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Amedisys may be required to reimburse UnitedHealth Group for the termination fee that UnitedHealth Group, on Amedisys behalf, paid to OPCH in addition to the termination fee payable by Amedisys to UnitedHealth Group upon termination of the Merger Agreement. The termination fee was recorded to other income (expense) within our condensed consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding liability to termination fee paid by UnitedHealth Group within our condensed consolidated balance sheet during the three-month period ended June 30, 2023. 
 Acquisitions 
 We complete acquisitions from time to time in order to pursue our strategy of increasing our market presence by expanding our service base and enhancing our position in certain geographic areas as a leading provider of home health, hospice and high acuity care services. The purchase price paid for acquisitions is negotiated through arm s length transactions, with consideration based on our analysis of, among other things, comparable acquisitions and expected cash flows. Acquisitions are accounted for as purchases and are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Goodwill generated from acquisitions is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over tangible and identifiable intangible assets because of the expected contributions of the acquisitions to our overall corporate strategy. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets for significant acquisitions. The

The net proceeds of million is inclusive of million that was placed into an escrow account in accordance with the closing payment and indemnity provisions within the purchase agreement. 
 Of the total million placed into escrow, million was set aside for the closing payment adjustment. The closing payment calculated on the acquisition date included estimates for cash, working capital and various other items. Under the purchase agreement, the purchase price was subject to an adjustment for any differences between estimated amounts included in the closing payment and actual amounts at close. The closing payment adjustment was finalized during 2023 with million being paid to Amedisys by the buyer. The million in escrow related to the closing payment adjustment was released to Amedisys during 2023. The remaining million placed into escrow, which was related to indemnity provisions within the purchase agreement, was released to Amedisys during the second quarter of 2024. 
 The disposition of our personal care business did not qualify as a discontinued operation because it did not represent a change in strategy that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations or financial results.

 Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement 
 Our Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to billion, which includes a million Revolving Credit Facility and a term loan facility with a principal amount of up to million (the "Amended Term Loan Facility" and collectively with the Revolving Credit Facility, the "Amended Credit Facility"). On March 10, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement (as amended by the Third Amendment, the "Third Amended Credit Agreement") which (i) formally replaced the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") for interest rate pricing and (ii) allowed for the disposition of our personal care business. 
 The loans issued under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest on a per annum basis, at our election, at either: (i) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate or (ii) the Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate. The Base Rate means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Term SOFR plus per annum. The Term SOFR means the quoted rate per annum equal to the SOFR for an interest period of one or three months (as selected by us) plus the SOFR adjustment of . The

 IV The final maturity date of the Amended Credit Facility is . The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate and be due and payable as of the final maturity date. The Amended Term Loan Facility, however, is subject to quarterly amortization of principal in the amount of (i) for the period commencing on July 30, 2021 and ending on September 30, 2023, and (ii) for the period commencing on October 1, 2023 and ending on July 30, 2026. The remaining balance of the Amended Term Loan Facility must be paid upon the final maturity date. In addition to the scheduled amortization of the Amended Term Loan Facility, and subject to customary exceptions and reinvestment rights, we are required to prepay the Amended Term Loan Facility first and the Revolving Credit Facility second with 100 of all net cash proceeds received by any loan party or any subsidiary thereof in connection with (a) any asset sale or disposition where such loan party receives net cash proceeds in excess of million or (b) any debt issuance that is not permitted under the Third Amended Credit Agreement. 
 In accordance with the requirements above, net proceeds received from the divestiture of our personal care line of business were used to prepay a portion of our Amended Term Loan Facility during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. 
 The Third Amended Credit Agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of funded indebtedness to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement, and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to cash interest charges, as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement. Each of these covenants is calculated over rolling four-quarter periods and also is subject to certain exceptions and baskets. The Third Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on: incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes, investments and declarations of dividends. These covenants contain customary exclusions and baskets as detailed in the Third Amended Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with our covenants under the Third Amended Credit Agreement. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Third Amended Credit Agreement requires at all times that we (i) provide guarantees from wholly-owned subsidiaries that in the aggregate represent not less than of our consolidated net revenues and adjusted EBITDA from all wholly-owned subsidiaries and (ii) provide guarantees from subsidiaries that in the aggregate represent not less than of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, subject to certain exceptions. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding borrowings under our 550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Our weighted average interest rate for borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facility was for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and and for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our availability under our million Revolving Credit Facility was million as we have outstanding borrowings and million outstanding in letters of credit.

 beneficiaries who received services from the subsidiary during the period of January 1, 2008 through March 31, 2010 (the Review Period to determine whether the underlying services met pertinent Medicare payment requirements. We acquired the hospice operations subject to this review on August 1, 2009; the Review Period covered time periods both before and after our ownership of these hospice operations. Based on the ZPIC s findings for beneficiaries, which were extrapolated to all claims for hospice services provided by the Florence subsidiary billed during the Review Period, on June 6, 2011, the Medicare Administrative Contractor MAC for the subsidiary issued a notice of overpayment seeking recovery from our subsidiary of an alleged overpayment. We disputed these findings, and our Florence subsidiary filed appeals through the Original Medicare Standard Appeals Process, in which we sought to have those findings overturned. An administrative law judge ("ALJ") hearing was held in early January 2015. On January 18, 2016, we received a letter referencing the ALJ hearing decision for the overpayment issued on June 6, 2011. The decision was partially favorable with a new overpayment amount of million with a balance owed of million, including interest, based on disputed claims (originally ). We filed an appeal to the Medicare Appeals Council on the remaining disputed claims and also argued that the statistical method used to select the sample was not valid. No assurances can be given as to the timing or outcome of the Medicare Appeals Council decision. As of September 30, 2024, Medicare has withheld payments of million (including additional interest) as part of their standard procedures once this level of the appeal process has been reached. In the event we are not able to recoup this alleged overpayment, we are entitled to be indemnified by the prior owners of the hospice operations for amounts relating to the period prior to August 1, 2009. On January 10, 2019, an arbitration panel from the American Health Lawyers Association determined that the prior owners' liability for their indemnification obligation was million. This amount is recorded as an indemnity receivable within other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 In July 2016, the Company received a request for medical records from SafeGuard Services, L.L.C SafeGuard ), a ZPIC, related to services provided by some of the care centers that the Company acquired from Infinity Home Care, L.L.C. The review period covered time periods both before and after our ownership of the care centers, which were acquired on December 31, 2015. In August 2017, the Company received Requests for Repayment from Palmetto GBA, LLC ("Palmetto") regarding Infinity Home Care of Lakeland, LLC ("Lakeland Care Centers") and Infinity Home Care of Pinellas, LLC ("Clearwater Care Center"). The Palmetto letters were based on a statistical extrapolation performed by SafeGuard which alleged an overpayment of million for the Lakeland Care Centers on a universe of Medicare claims totaling million in actual claims payments and an overpayment of million for the Clearwater Care Center on a universe of Medicare claims totaling million in actual claims payments. 
 As a result of partially successful Level I and Level II Administrative Appeals, the alleged overpayment for the Lakeland Care Centers was reduced to million, and the alleged overpayment for the Clearwater Care Center was reduced to million. The Company filed Level III Administrative Appeals, and the ALJ hearings regarding the Lakeland Request for Repayment and the Clearwater Request for Repayment were held in April 2022. The Company received the results of the ALJ hearings in June 2022. The ALJ decisions for both the Clearwater Care Center and the Lakeland Care Centers were partially favorable for the claims that were reviewed, but the extrapolations were upheld. As a result, we increased our total accrual related to these

The repayments for the Lakeland Care Centers totaling million million extrapolated repayment plus million accrued interest) and the Clearwater Care Center totaling million million extrapolated repayment plus million accrued interest) were made during the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, we wrote off million of receivables that were impacted by these matters during the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect to be indemnified by the prior owners, upon exhaustion of the parties' appeal rights, for approximately million and have recorded this amount within other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Insurance 
 We are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs, including employee health, workers compensation, professional liability and fleet. While we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks, we are self-insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims. We recognize our obligations associated with these costs, up to specified deductible limits in the period in which a claim is incurred, including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. These costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience. Such estimates, and the resulting reserves, are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis. 
 Our health insurance has an exposure limit of million for any individual covered life. Our workers compensation insurance has a retention limit of million per incident. Our professional liability insurance has a retention limit of million per incident. Our fleet insurance has an exposure limit of million per accident.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein, and the consolidated financial statements and notes and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). Historical results that appear in the condensed consolidated financial statements should not be interpreted as being indicative of future operations. 
 Unless otherwise provided, Amedisys, we, our, and the Company refer to Amedisys, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 We are a provider of high-quality in-home healthcare and related services to the chronic, co-morbid, aging American population with approximately 70 of our consolidated net service revenue derived from Medicare for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 73 of our consolidated net service revenue derived from Medicare for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023.

 Proposed Merger 
 On June 26, 2023, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("UnitedHealth Group"), and Aurora Holdings Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Amedisys with Amedisys continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (the Merger ). 
 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), by virtue of the Merger: (i) each share of Amedisys common stock Amedisys Common Stock held in treasury by Amedisys or owned by UnitedHealth Group or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled (collectively, cancelled shares without consideration; and (ii) each share of Amedisys Common Stock, other than any cancelled shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive 101 per share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. 
 The Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement. These closing conditions include, among others, (i) approval by Amedisys stockholders at the Amedisys Stockholders Meeting (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which approval was obtained on September 8, 2023; (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the receipt of the required state regulatory approvals; (iv) the absence of any law or order that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the Merger; and (v) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated 
 24 

by the Merger Agreement under all applicable antitrust laws without the imposition by any governmental entity of any term, condition, obligation, requirement, limitation, prohibition, remedy, sanction or other action that has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Due to these conditions and other contingencies, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be successfully completed. During the periods prior to and including the date of the closing of the Merger, we expect to incur significant additional merger-related expenses. See Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, for a discussion of our risk factors related to the proposed merger. 
 On June 28, 2024, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group and certain of their respective subsidiaries entered into an agreement relating to the sale of certain Amedisys home health care centers and certain UnitedHealth Group care centers to VCG Luna, LLC, an affiliate of VitalCaring Group (the "Divestiture"). Consummation of the Divestiture is contingent on a number of conditions, including the consummation of the Merger, which itself is subject to a number of conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Amedisys and UnitedHealth Group continue to work cooperatively with the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") staff in their review of the Merger, but Amedisys cannot be certain as to when the DOJ's review will be completed or the outcome of that review. 
 Termination of Option Care Health, Inc. ("OPCH") Merger Agreement 
 As previously disclosed in Amedisys' Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2023 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 4, 2023, Amedisys entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on May 3, 2023 (the OPCH Merger Agreement with OPCH, a Delaware corporation, and Uintah Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of OPCH OPCH Merger Sub ). On June 26, 2023, Amedisys, OPCH and OPCH Merger Sub entered into the Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement ), pursuant to which the parties thereto agreed to terminate the OPCH Merger Agreement and grant mutual releases by the parties of all claims against the other parties based upon, arising from, in connection with or relating to the OPCH Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, each of the termination of the OPCH Merger Agreement and the mutual releases provided for in the Termination Agreement would become effective upon receipt by OPCH of a 106,000,000 termination fee payable by, or on behalf of, Amedisys within 24 hours of the execution of the Termination Agreement (i.e., before the market open on June 27, 2023). On June 26, 2023, following the execution of the Termination Agreement, UnitedHealth Group, on behalf of Amedisys, delivered funds to OPCH in an amount equal to 106,000,000, representing the termination fee payable to OPCH under the OPCH Merger Agreement and the Termination Agreement, satisfying the condition precedent to the effectiveness of the termination of the OPCH Merger Agreement and the releases contained in the Termination Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Amedisys may be required to reimburse UnitedHealth Group for the 106,000,000 termination fee that UnitedHealth Group, on Amedisys behalf, paid to OPCH in addition to the 125,000,000 termination fee payable by Amedisys to UnitedHealth Group upon termination of the Merger Agreement. The 106,000,000 termination fee was recorded to other income (expense) within our condensed consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding liability to termination fee paid by UnitedHealth Group within our condensed consolidated balance sheet during the three-month period ended June 30, 2023. 
 Personal Care Divestiture 
 On March 31, 2023, we sold our personal care business. We received net proceeds of 47.8 million and recognized a loss of 2.2 million in connection with the divestiture during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. 
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") Payment Updates 
 Hospice 
 On July 28, 2023, CMS issued the final rule to update hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year 2024, effective for services provided beginning October 1, 2023. CMS estimated hospices serving Medicare beneficiaries would see a 3.1 increase in payments. This increase was the result of a 3.3 market basket adjustment as required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ("PPACA") less a 0.2 productivity adjustment. Additionally, CMS increased the aggregate cap amount by 3.1 to 33,494. Our company-specific impact was in line with CMS' estimate. 
 On July 30, 2024, CMS issued the final rule to update hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year 2025, effective for services provided beginning October 1, 2024. CMS estimates hospices serving Medicare beneficiaries will see a 2.9 increase in payments. This increase is the result of a 3.4 market basket adjustment as required under PPACA less a 0.5 productivity adjustment. Additionally, CMS increased the aggregate cap amount by 2.9 to 34,465. Based on our analysis of the final rule, we expect our impact to be in line with the 2.9 increase.

Home Health 
 On November 1, 2023, CMS issued the Calendar Year ("CY") 2024 Final Rule for Medicare home health providers. CMS estimated that the final rule would result in a 0.8 increase in payments to home health providers. This increase was the result of a 3.0 payment update (3.3 market basket adjustment less a 0.3 productivity adjustment) and an increase of 0.4 for the update to the fixed-dollar loss ratio used in determining outlier payments offset by a permanent adjustment of -2.6 based on the difference between assumed and actual behavior changes resulting from the implementation of the Patient-Driven Groupings Model ("PDGM"). The -2.6 permanent adjustment was derived from a -2.890 adjustment which was only applied to the 30-day payment rate and not the low utilization payment adjustment. The -2.890 adjustment was only half of the total proposed adjustment. The remaining adjustment was to be considered in future rulemaking. Our company-specific impact has been in line with CMS' estimate. 
 In addition to permanent adjustments, CMS also has discretion to make temporary adjustments through calendar year 2026. CMS elected not to implement a temporary adjustment for calendar year 2024. 
 On November 1, 2024, CMS issued the CY 2025 Final Rule for Medicare home health providers. CMS estimates that the final rule will result in a 0.5 increase in payments to home health providers. This increase is the result of a 2.7 payment update (3.2 market basket adjustment less a 0.5 productivity adjustment) offset by a decrease of 0.4 for the update to the fixed-dollar loss ratio used in determining outlier payments and a permanent adjustment of -1.8 based on the difference between assumed and actual behavior changes resulting from the implementation of PDGM. Based on our analysis of the final rule, we expect our impact to be in line with the 0.5 increase. 
 Results of Operations 
 Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023 
 Consolidated 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations (amounts in millions): 
 For the Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net service revenue 587.7 556.2 Cost of service, inclusive of depreciation 337.6 311.6 Gross margin 250.1 244.6 of revenue 42.6 44.0 General and administrative expenses 215.0 198.0 of revenue 36.6 35.6 Depreciation and amortization 4.8 4.4 Operating income 30.3 42.2 Total other expense, net (1.3) (4.3) Income tax expense (12.5) (12.3) Effective income tax rate 43.0 32.5 Net income 16.5 25.6 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 0.3 Net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. 16.9 26.0 
 
 On a consolidated basis, our operating income decreased 12 million on a 32 million increase in net service revenue. Our year-over-year results reflect an increase in our merger-related expenses totaling 12 million. Excluding our merger-related expenses, our operating income was flat on a net service revenue increase of 32 million. Rate increases and home health volume growth, which are the main drivers of our revenue growth, were offset by planned wage increases, wage inflation, a shift in our home health payor mix, investments in hospice clinical staffing, an increase in our health insurance costs and an increase in our general and administrative expenses. 
 Additionally, several of our care centers located in Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene near the end of the quarter. We estimate that the storm resulted in a negative impact to our home health episodic admissions of approximately 300 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. We also incurred 
 26 

incremental costs related to inclement weather pay, fuel and supplies. We expect our fourth quarter results to continue to be impacted by Hurricane Helene as well as Hurricane Milton which made landfall in October. 
 Our operating results reflect a 17 million increase in our general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year. Excluding the increase in our merger-related expenses 12 million), our general and administrative expenses increased 5 million primarily due to planned wage increases and higher incentive compensation costs. 
 Total other expense, net includes the following items (amounts in millions):

 Operating Results 
 Overall, our operating income decreased 2 million on a 21 million increase in net service revenue. Volume growth and rate increases, which are the main drivers of our revenue growth, were offset by a shift in our payor mix, planned wage increases, wage inflation and higher health insurance costs. 
 28 

Additionally, several of our care centers located in Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene near the end of the quarter. We estimate that the storm resulted in a negative impact to our home health episodic admissions of approximately 300 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. We also incurred incremental costs related to inclement weather pay, fuel and supplies. We expect our fourth quarter results to continue to be impacted by Hurricane Helene as well as Hurricane Milton which made landfall in October. 
 Net Service Revenue 
 Our net service revenue increased 21 million as a result of total volume growth of 9 and rate increases (both Medicare and per visit). 
 Cost of Service, Inclusive of Depreciation 
 Our cost of service consists of costs associated with direct clinician care in the homes of our patients as well as the cost of clinical managers who monitor the overall delivery of care. Overall, our total cost of service increased 10 due to a 4 increase in our total cost per visit and a 6 increase in total visits year over year. The 4 increase in our total cost per visit is primarily due to planned wage increases, wage inflation, an increase in health insurance costs and visit mix. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses increased 2 million due to planned wage increases and higher incentive compensation costs partially offset by savings associated with clinical optimization and reorganization initiatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (amounts in millions): 
 For the Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 151.4 76.9 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (7.1) 37.1 Cash used in financing activities (37.7) (74.1) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 106.6 39.9 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 138.9 54.1 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 245.5 94.0 
 
 Our operating cash flow increased 74.5 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher collections of accounts receivable and the timing of the payment of accounts payable. Our prior year accounts receivable collections were impacted by delays in billing and payor rate changes during the third quarter. 
 Our investing activities primarily consist of the purchase of property and equipment and technology assets, investments and acquisitions/divestitures. Cash used in investing activities totaled 7.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment and technology assets as well as investments in joint ventures. Cash provided by investing activities totaled 37.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily related to the divestiture of our personal care line of business. 
 Our financing activities primarily consist of borrowings under our term loan and/or revolving credit facility, repayments of borrowings, the remittance of taxes associated with shares withheld on non-cash compensation and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions. Cash used in financing activities totaled 37.7 million and 74.1 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was primarily related to the repayment of borrowings and the remittance of taxes associated with shares withheld on non-cash compensation. Net proceeds from the divestiture of our personal care line of business were used to pay down a portion of our outstanding term loan borrowings during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity 
 Typically, our principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable, primarily through the Medicare program. In addition to our collection of patient accounts receivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness. 
 Prior to February 2024, the Company exclusively utilized Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to Medicare and all other payors for reimbursement. On February 22, 2024, UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare s information technology systems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations; however, we were delayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors which resulted in a reduction in our operating cash flow and an increase in our accounts receivable during the first and second quarters. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we were able to quickly redirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. As of September 30, 2024, we have resolved the build up in accounts receivable resulting from the Change Healthcare outage, and we are continuing to utilize an additional clearinghouse to submit patient claims for reimbursement. 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we spent 6.1 million in capital expenditures and investments in technology assets as compared to 10.6 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Our capital expenditures and investments in technology assets for 2024 are expected to be approximately 8.0 million, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions. 
 38 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 245.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and 511.2 million in availability under our 550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Based on our operating forecasts and our debt service requirements, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital requirements and debt service requirements for the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Outstanding Patient Accounts Receivable 
 Our patient accounts receivable decreased 12 million from December 31, 2023. Our cash collections as a percentage of revenue was 101 and 100 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our days revenue outstanding at September 30, 2024 was 44.4 days, which is a decrease of 3.3 days from December 31, 2023 and a decrease of 5.4 days when compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Our patient accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables which are aged based upon our initial service date. We monitor unbilled receivables on a care center by care center basis to ensure that all efforts are made to bill claims within timely filing deadlines. Our unbilled patient accounts receivable can be impacted by pre-claim reviews in the Review Choice Demonstration states, reviews under the Targeted Probe and Educate program, voluntary pre-bill edits and reviews, efforts to secure needed documentation to bill (orders, consents, etc.), integrations of acquisitions, changes of ownership and any regulatory and procedural updates impacting claim submissions. The timely filing deadline for Medicare is one year from the date of the last billable service in the 30-day billing period and varies by state for Medicaid-reimbursable services and among insurance companies and other private payors. 
 The following schedules detail our patient accounts receivable, by payor class, aged based upon initial date of service (amounts in millions, except days revenue outstanding): 
 0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total At September 30, 2024: Medicare patient accounts receivable 176.8 7.6 1.4 0.2 186.0 Other patient accounts receivable: Medicaid 20.9 3.1 2.0 26.0 Private 76.8 6.0 6.3 89.1 Total 97.7 9.1 8.3 115.1 Total patient accounts receivable 301.1 Days revenue outstanding (1) 44.4 0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total At December 31, 2023: Medicare patient accounts receivable 190.3 16.1 6.4 1.9 214.7 Other patient accounts receivable: Medicaid 17.8 1.4 0.5 19.7 Private 67.4 6.6 5.0 79.0 Total 85.2 8.0 5.5 98.7 Total patient accounts receivable 313.4 Days revenue outstanding (1) 47.7 

(1) Our calculation of days revenue outstanding is derived by dividing our ending patient accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by our average daily net service revenue for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Indebtedness 
 Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement 
 Our Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to 1.0 billion, which includes a 550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and a term loan facility with a principal amount of up to 450.0 million (the "Amended Term Loan Facility" and collectively with the Revolving Credit Facility, the "Amended Credit Facility"). On March 10, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement (as amended by the Third Amendment, the "Third Amended Credit Agreement") which (i) formally replaced the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") for interest rate pricing and (ii) allowed for the disposition of our personal care business. In accordance with the requirements under the Third Amended Credit Agreement, net proceeds received from the divestiture of our personal care line of business were used to prepay a portion of our Amended Term Loan Facility during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. 
 The loans issued under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest on a per annum basis, at our election, at either: (i) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate or (ii) the Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate. The Base Rate means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Term SOFR plus 1 per annum. The Term SOFR means the quoted rate per annum equal to the SOFR for an interest period of one or three months (as selected by us) plus the SOFR adjustment of 0.10 . 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Our weighted average interest rate for borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facility was 7.2 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 7.1 and 6.6 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our availability under our 550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility was 511.2 million as we have no outstanding borrowings and 38.8 million outstanding in letters of credit. We are in compliance with our covenants under the Third Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 See Note 5 - Long-Term Obligations to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on our outstanding long-term obligations. 
 Inflation 
 Our operations have been materially impacted by the current inflationary environment as we have experienced inflation in our labor costs. We expect inflation to continue to impact our operations throughout 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the impacts of inflation on our results of operations have been partially mitigated by rate increases and clinical optimization and reorganization initiatives. No assurance can be given as to our ability to offset the impacts of inflation in the future. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 See Part II, Item 7 Critical Accounting Estimates and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for accounting policies and related estimates we believe are the most critical to understanding our condensed consolidated financial statements, financial condition and results of operations and which require complex management judgment and assumptions or involve uncertainties. These critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition, business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets. There have not been any changes to our significant accounting policies or their application since we filed our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. Our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility carry a floating interest rate which is tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and the Prime Rate, and therefore, our condensed consolidated statements of operations and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was 355.0 million. A 1.0 interest rate change would cause interest expense to change by approximately 3.6 million annually, assuming the Company makes no principal repayments.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, disclosed and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. This information is also accumulated and communicated to our management and Board of Directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. 
 Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that have occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to materially impact, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and, based on an evaluation of our controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 See Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information concerning our legal proceedings. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 The risk factors set forth below update, and should be read together with, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023: 
 Our business depends on our information systems. A cyber-attack, security breach or our inability to effectively integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure and operational could disrupt our operations. 
 In general, all information systems, including those we host or have hosted by third parties, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, human error, malicious acts, break-ins and other intentional or unintentional events. Our business is also at risk from and may be materially impacted and/or disrupted by information security incidents, such as ransomware, malware, viruses, phishing, social engineering and other security events. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. These events can also result from internal compromises, such as human error or a rogue employee or contractor, and can occur on our systems or on the systems of our partners and subcontractors. Additionally, our current information systems are subject to other non-environmental risks, including technological obsolescence, in some instances, which may create increased security and/or operational risk. 
 Our networks, systems and devices store sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of our patients, partners and employees. We have installed a number of protective technology systems and devices on our network, systems and point of care tablets in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to information created, received, transmitted and maintained by us. However, healthcare companies are routinely targeted by threat actors, and no level of security can guarantee that cybersecurity incidents will not occur. In the event of a sophisticated ransomware attack, malware, viruses, phishing or social engineering, our technology may fail to adequately secure the protected health information and personal information we create, receive, transmit and maintain in our databases. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our patients and regulators, which could result in fines, litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are not held liable, any resulting negative publicity could harm our business and distract the attention of management. 
 As a healthcare provider, we face increased legal and regulatory compliance risk in the event of a cyber-attack. Healthcare providers and health insurance plans must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") regulations regarding the privacy and security of protected health information. The HIPAA regulations impose significant requirements on providers with regard to how such protected health information may be used and disclosed. Further, the regulations include extensive and complex requirements for providers to establish reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information. HIPAA directs the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements. Entities within the U.S. that are found to be in violation of HIPAA may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when providers establish reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards, it is difficult to fully protect information systems from a breach or security incident. In the event a provider experiences a "breach" and protected health information is compromised, the provider is obligated under HIPAA to notify individuals, the government, and in the event the breach involves 500 or more individuals, the media. There are significant costs associated with a breach, including investigation costs, remediation and mitigation costs, notification costs, attorney fees, litigation and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to a loss in confidence in the provider. We cannot predict the costs to comply with these laws or the costs associated with a potential breach of protected health information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our business reputation. 
 In addition to federal regulators, state attorneys general are also enforcing proactive security protocols and reporting requirements relating to information security breaches. All 50 states and the U.S. territories have breach notification laws; some 
 42 

of these laws also include proactive data security requirements. In addition to state laws regarding confidentiality of medical information, several states expanded state privacy laws regarding personal information which is more broadly defined than medical information. 
 As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to mitigate and alleviate problems caused by security incidents, including unauthorized access to protected health information and personal information stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer viruses or other malicious software programs to our systems. If we don't expend capital and other resources to continually enhance our security systems, our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected by federal and state fines and penalties, legal claims or proceedings, cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented. 
 Our business depends on effective, secure and operational information systems that include systems provided by or hosted by external contractors, partners and other service providers. For example, our care centers depend upon information systems and software hosted by third-party vendors for patient care, accounting, billing, collections, risk management, quality assurance, human resources, payroll and other information considered to be sensitive and/or confidential, including protected health information. These third-party vendors or business associates, in the event the vendor creates, receives, transmits or maintains protected health information on our behalf, are required to comply with substantially the same HIPAA requirements as the healthcare provider. This is accomplished through the use of "Business Associate Agreements" with vendors. However, third- and fourth-party security incidents and supply-chain cyber attacks have been increasingly common, and there is no way for an organization to ensure that such incidents and attacks do not occur. The occurrence of any information system failure, breach or security incident, or a vendor's breach of the Business Associate Agreement could result in interruptions, delays, breaches of protected health information and personal information, loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems and the information they create, receive, transmit or maintain. An extended service outage affecting these or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. For example, in February 2024, UnitedHealth Group announced a cyber-attack on the information technology systems of its subsidiary, Change Healthcare, one of the largest providers of healthcare payment systems in the United States. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations; however, we were delayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we were able to quickly redirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. The delays in submitting non-Medicare claims resulted in a reduction of our operating cash flow and an estimated increase to our accounts receivable of approximately 60 million during the three month-period ended March 31, 2024. Any of these events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and they could harm our business reputation. 
 If we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could result in harm to patients; business interruptions and delays; the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; reputational damage and federal and state governmental inquiries. Any such problems or failures and the costs incurred in correcting any such problems or failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, to the extent our external information technology contractors or other service providers have their own cyber-attack, security event or information technology failure, become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems we have licensed from them, our operations could be materially adversely affected. A failure to restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Because of the protected health information we store and transmit, loss of electronically stored information for any reason could expose us to risk of regulatory action and litigation and possible liability and loss. 
 Problems with, or the failure of, our technology and systems or any system upgrades or programming changes associated with such technology and systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations, patient care, data capture and integrity, medical documentation, billing, collections, assessment of internal controls and management and reporting capabilities. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our information systems and applications also require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational and security needs. Our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems. We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory investigations or audits and increases in administrative expenses. 
 We believe we have all the necessary licenses from third parties to use technology and software that we do not own. A third-party could, however, allege that we are infringing its rights, which may deter our ability to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms from the third-party, if at all, or cause the third-party to commence litigation against us. In addition, we may 
 43 

find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the scope and validity of any proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation, or the failure to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights, could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Delays in payment may cause liquidity problems. 
 Our business is characterized by delays from the time we provide services to the time we receive payment for these services. Timing delays in billings and collections may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that delays in obtaining documentation support, information technology system problems or outages, or Medicare or other payor issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk. 
 In February 2024, UnitedHealth Group announced a cyberattack on the information technology systems of its subsidiary, Change Healthcare, one of the largest providers of healthcare payment systems in the United States. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations; however, we were delayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we were able to quickly redirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. The delays in submitting non-Medicare claims resulted in a reduction of our operating cash flow and an estimated increase to our accounts receivable of approximately 60 million during the three month-period ended March 31, 2024. Any similar events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 On May 29, 2018, CMS issued a notice indicating its intention to re-launch a home health agency pre-claim review demonstration project. Now called the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services ("RCD") and fully implemented in six states (Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Oklahoma), RCD gives home health agencies three initial options: pre-claim review of all claims, post-payment review of all claims or minimal post-payment review with a 25 payment reduction for all home health services. Reduced review options are available for home health agencies that demonstrate compliance. 
 CMS has also implemented the Targeted Probe and Educate ("TPE") program for home health and hospice providers to help reduce provider claim denials and educate providers on appropriate billing practices. Under the TPE program, Medicare Administrative Contractors ("MACs") use data analysis to identify providers who have high claim error rates, unusual billing practices or provide services that have high national error rates. If a provider is selected for a TPE review by a MAC, the initial volume of claims reviewed is limited to 20 to 40 claims and can include up to three rounds of claims review, if necessary, with corresponding provider education and a subsequent period to allow for improvement. If results do not improve sufficiently after three rounds, the MAC may refer the provider to CMS for further action which may include 100 prepay review, extrapolation, referral to a Recovery Auditor and/or referral for revocation from the Medicare program. Providers will not be under TPE review and RCD at the same time. Providers currently on TPE review will be removed prior to CMS implementing RCD in that particular state. 
 Compliance with the RCD and TPE processes has resulted in increased administrative costs and delays in reimbursement for services in the states subject to RCD and TPE review. These delays could materially adversely affect our working capital. 
 Additionally, our hospice operations may experience payment delays when attempting to collect funds from state Medicaid programs in certain instances. Delays in receiving payments from these programs may also materially adversely affect our working capital.

 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 (a) 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
 As previously disclosed, on June 26, 2023, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation UnitedHealth Group ), and Aurora Holdings Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Merger Sub ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Amedisys with Amedisys continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (the Merger ). The consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Amedisys and UnitedHealth Group continue to work cooperatively with the DOJ staff in their review of the Merger, but Amedisys cannot be certain as to when the DOJ's review will be completed or the outcome of that review. To ensure continued compliance with Nasdaq listing rules requiring listed companies to hold an annual meeting before the end of each fiscal year, the Company s Board of Directors (the Board determined on November 4, 2024 that the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the Annual Meeting will be held on Monday, December 30, 2024 if the Merger has not closed by that date. If the Merger closes before December 30, 2024, the Board will cancel the Annual Meeting. The record date for the Annual Meeting will be December 5, 2024. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on that date may attend and vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
 Because the date of the Annual Meeting will differ by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the Company s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the previously announced deadline for stockholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act is no longer applicable. Under the new deadline set by the Company, any stockholder proposal intended to be included in the Company s proxy materials for the Annual Meeting pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 must be delivered to, or mailed to and received at, the Company s principal executive offices located at 3854 American Way, Suite A, Baton Rouge, LA 70816, Attn: Corporate Secretary, on or before the close of business on November 18, 2024, which the Company has determined to be a reasonable time before it expects to begin to print and distribute its proxy materials for the Annual Meeting. In addition to complying with this deadline, stockholder proposals intended to be included in the Company s proxy materials for the Annual Meeting must also comply with all applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, including Exchange Act Rule 14a-8. 
 In addition, because the date of the Annual Meeting will be more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the Company s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the previously announced deadline for stockholder proposals or nominations under Section 2.8 of the Company s Amended and Restated By-Laws (the By-Laws is no longer applicable. Pursuant to the By-Laws, the new deadline for any stockholder proposal or nomination (including nominations pursuant to Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act), other than pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, intended to be brought before the Annual Meeting must be delivered to, or mailed to and received at, the Company s principal executive offices located at 3854 American Way, Suite A, Baton Rouge, LA 70816, Attn: Corporate Secretary, on or before the close of business on November 17, 2024. In addition to complying with this deadline, stockholder proposals or nominations intended to be brought before the Annual Meeting must also comply with all applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the By-Laws and applicable law, including the additional requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act.

 This Third Amendment (this Amendment to the Amedisys, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the Plan ), is entered into this 31st day of July, 2024, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee of Amedisys, Inc. (the Company ), as authorized pursuant to Section 19 of the Plan. 
 
 WHEREAS , the Company established and maintains the Plan, as it may be amended and or restated from time to time 
 
 WHEREAS , Section 19 of the Plan permits the Committee to amend the Plan without stockholder approval as set forth therein and 
 
 WHEREAS , the Committee now desires to amend the Plan, effective as of the day immediately preceding the closing date of the Company s merger (the Merger with UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the Effective Date ), yet contingent upon such closing, to provide that vested stock options be exercised automatically on the day they expire if they are in-the-money at the time of expiration. 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE , for Awards that are outstanding on the Effective Date, the Plan is hereby amended, contingent upon the closing of the Merger, effective as of the Effective Date, as follows 
 
 1. 
 
 Section 8 of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a new subsection 8.6 as follows 
 
 8.6. Automatic Exercise of Certain Expiring Options. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award Notice or Award agreement (other than this Section 8), on the last trading day on which all or a portion of an outstanding Option may be exercised, if as of the close of trading on such day the then Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock exceeds the per share Exercise Price of the Option by at least .01 (such expiring portion of an Option that is so in-the-money, an Auto-Exercise Eligible Option ), the optionee shall be deemed to have automatically exercised such Auto-Exercise Eligible Option (to the extent it has not previously been exercised, forfeited, or terminated) as of the close of trading in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.6. In the event of an automatic exercise pursuant to this Section 8.6, the Company shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued to the optionee upon such optionee s automatic exercise of the Auto-Exercise Eligible Option in an amount necessary to satisfy (1) the optionee s Exercise Price obligation for the Auto-Exercise Eligible Option and (2) the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld in connection with the automatic exercise (or such other rate that will not cause adverse accounting consequences for 

the Company) unless the Committee deems that a different method of satisfying such withholding obligations is practicable and advisable, in each case based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the close of trading on the date of exercise. In accordance with procedures established by the Committee, an optionee may notify the Company s record-keeper in writing in advance that he or she does not wish for the Auto-Exercise Eligible Option to be exercised. This Section 8.6 shall not apply to any Option to the extent that this Section causes the Option to fail to qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable law. In its discretion, the Company may determine to cease automatically exercising Options at any time. 
 
 2. 
 
 Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan. 
 
 3. 
 
 This Amendment shall be void and of no force and effect if the Merger does not close. 
 
 Except as specifically set forth above, the terms of the Plan shall continue in full force and effect. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Committee has caused this Amendment to be adopted and executed on the date first set forth above.
