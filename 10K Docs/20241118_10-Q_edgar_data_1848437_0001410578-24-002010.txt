 or more businesses (the Business Combination ). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. On January 7, 2022, the Company closed its initial public offering (the IPO and completed the sale of units (the Units ), including Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter s option to purchase additional units to cover over-allotments, each Unit consisting of (i) Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value per share (collectively, the Class A ordinary shares ), and (ii) one -half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (collectively, the Warrants ). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase Class A ordinary share for per share. The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of (before underwriting discounts and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants to Cartica Acquisition Partners, LLC (the Sponsor at a purchase price of per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) will not be redeemable by the Company (except as described in the registration statement for the Company s IPO (the Registration Statement )); (ii) may not (and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants may not) be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders thereof until days after the completion of the Company s Business Combination (subject to certain exceptions described in the Registration Statement); (iii) may be exercised by the holders thereof on a cashless basis; and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Transaction costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting discount and of other offering costs. The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The rules of the stock exchange that the Company will list its securities on will require that the Company s Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. At the closing of the IPO, an amount equal to at least per Unit sold in the IPO, including proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were deposited in a trust account (the Trust Account ), located in the United States and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) Company s liquidation. However, to mitigate the risk of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), on January 5, 2024, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash items until the earlier of consummation of its Business Combination or liquidation, as reflected in the amendment to the investment management trust agreement.

 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations), calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of the Business Combination. The per-share amount to be distributed to public shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions which the underwriter for the Company s IPO has waived (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company s Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. In accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and its guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares have been issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of Class A ordinary shares classified as temporary equity will be allocated the proceeds as determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The Class A ordinary shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. Although redemptions cannot cause the Company s net tangible assets to fall below , the Public Shares are redeemable and have been classified as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, it receives an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transactions is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote any Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and Public Shares held by it in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against a proposed Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.

 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The Sponsor and the Company s directors and officers have agreed to waive: (i) their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of the Company s Business Combination and (ii) their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with its Business Combination or to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete its Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre- Business Combination activity. On May 23, 2023, the Sponsor entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with the Cartica Investors, LP and Cartica Investors II, LP (together, the Cartica Funds and Namaste Universe Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Namaste ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Namaste acquired from the Cartica Funds, certain membership interests in the Sponsor, which combined interests entitled Namaste to receive, in the aggregate, Class B ordinary shares, par value per share and private placement warrants (the transaction, the Transfer ). In connection with the Transfer, the Company terminated the Forward Purchase Agreement, amended the administrative support agreement (see Note 5), and experienced a change in its board of directors, as more fully described below within these condensed financial statements. In connection with the Transfer, on May 23, 2023, Subramanian Ramadorai, Keki M. Mistry, Farida Khambata, Parul Bhandari, Asif Ramji and Steven J. Quamme resigned as directors of the Company s board of directors and Steven J. Quamme resigned as interim Chief Executive Officer. Concurrently with the Transfer, holders of the Company s Class B ordinary shares elected Suresh Guduru, Suresh Singamsetty, Kishore Kondragunta, Rana Gujral, Kyle Ingvald Parent and John F. Levy as directors of the Company s board of directors (collectively, the New Directors ). In addition, Kyle Ingvald Parent and Suresh Singamsetty were appointed as Class I directors with a term expiring at the Company s first annual general meeting; John F. Levy and Kishore Kondragunta were appointed as Class II directors with a term expiring at the second annual general meeting; and Rana Gujral and Suresh Guduru were appointed as Class III directors with a term expiring at the Company s third annual general meeting. John F. Levy, Rana Gujral and Kyle Invalid Parent have been appointed as members of the Board s audit committee (the Audit Committee and compensation, nominating and corporate governance committee, with Mr. Levy serving as the Chairman of the Audit Committee and Mr. Gujral serving as the Chairman of the compensation, nominating and corporate governance committee. The Company s board determined that John F. Levy, Rana Gujral, Kyle Ingvald Parent and Kishore Kondragunta are each an independent director as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules.

 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor, upon the conversion (the Conversion of an equal number of the Company s Class B ordinary shares, par value per share, held by the Sponsor. The Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B ordinary shares before the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of a Business Combination as described in the prospectus for the Company s IPO. On June 30, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting in lieu of an annual meeting (the First Extension Meeting to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the First Charter Amendment to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from July 7, 2023 to April 7, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board) (the First Extension ). In connection with the First Extension Meeting, shareholders holding Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company s Trust Account. Following the redemptions and the Conversion, there were Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding and Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding and the Sponsor holds approximately of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares. On July 17, 2023, the Company paid an aggregate amount of from the Trust Account to the aforementioned redeeming shareholders for the Public Shares redeemed on June 30, 2023 which included interest earned through July 13, 2023, the date the redemption was processed (see Note 2). On January 5, 2024, the Company instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank, with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or the Company s liquidation, which was reflected in the amendment to the investment management trust agreement with Continental. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the initial public offering and private placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. On April 3, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting in lieu of an annual general meeting of shareholders (the Second Extension Meeting at which the Company s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as amended (the Second Charter Amendment to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from April 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025 (the Second Extension ). In connection with the Second Charter Amendment, the Company issued a promissory note (the Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to in connection with the extension of the Company s termination date from April 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025. The Company first deposited in its Trust Account on April 7, 2024, and has deposited thereafter and will continue to deposit in its Trust Account on the 7th day of each subsequent month through January 7, 2025 for the benefits of Public Shares that were not redeemed in connection with the Second Extension. In connection with the Second Extension, shareholders holding Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company s Trust Account. As a result, approximately million (approximately per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Immediately following the redemptions, there were Public Shares issued and outstanding . On April 16, 2024, the Company received a notice (the Nasdaq Delisting Notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the Nasdaq or the Exchange indicating that the Company did not regain compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule during the Extension Period, as defined below. On September 25, 2023, the Company received a written notice from the Nasdaq indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2), which requires the Company to maintain at least 400 total holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market (the Minimum Total Holders Rule ). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(B)(i), the maximum amount of time for the Company to regain compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule is 180 days, or until March 25, 2024 (the Extension Period ).

Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed under the terms of the Extension Note. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the company had drawn additional to cover extension payments in the Trust Account to allow extension through December 7, 2024. Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, and structuring, negotiating, and consummating the Business Combination. The Company may need to raise further additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing.

The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.

The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the condensed statements of operations. The Company used both the Black-Scholes Merton formula and a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants at Initial Measurement. The Company allocated the proceeds received from (i) the sale of Units (which is inclusive of Class A ordinary share and one -half of one Public Warrant) and (ii) the sale of Private Placement Warrants, first to the warrants based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, with the remaining proceeds allocated to ordinary shares subject to possible redemption (temporary equity) based on their relative fair values at the initial measurement date. The Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at Initial Measurement due to the use of unobservable inputs. Inherent in pricing models are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate. At initial measurement, the Company estimated the selected volatility of its ordinary shares based on the implied volatility of comparable SPAC warrants. Effective February 25, 2022, the Public Warrants began trading separately. As of September 30, 2024, the value of Public Warrants is based on observable trading prices. As of December 31, 2023, in order to value the Private Placement Warrants, the Company compared the expected fair value of the Public Warrants using a Monte Carlo simulation model to the trading value of the Public Warrants to calculate an estimate of the probability of a successful Business Combination. The inputs used in the Monte Carlo analysis included expected market volatility, expected risk-free interest rate and expected life of the Public Warrants. The Company estimated the selected market volatility following a successful Business Combination by considering the five year historical volatility of the NASDAQ 100 Tech Sector index. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the Public Warrants following a successful Business Combination. The Company used the contractual five-year life as the expected life of the Public Warrants. The Company compared the estimated fair value of the Public Warrants following a successful Business Combination to the current trading price of the Public Warrants to calculate an estimate of the probability of a successful Business Combination. The Company then applied a Black-Scholes formula and the calculated probability of a successful Business Combination to estimate the fair value of the Private Warrants. The inputs into the Black Scholes model for the Private Warrants at initial measurement were the same as those used in the Public Warrant analysis. As of September 30, 2024, in order to value the Private Placement Warrants, the Company compared the expected fair value of the Public Warrants using a Monte Carlo simulation model to the trading value of the Public Warrants to calculate an implied volatility and probability of successful Business Combination. The inputs used in the Monte Carlo analysis included implied volatility, expected risk-

 We have until January 7, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors) to complete a Business Combination (see April 2024 update below for the Second Charter Amendment). If we have not completed a Business Combination within such period of time, we may, however, elect to seek to extend the Combination Period consistent with applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules. Such an extension requires the approval of our shareholders, who will be provided the opportunity at that time to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares (which would likely have a material adverse effect on the amount held in the Trust Account and other adverse effects on us, such as our ability to maintain its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In the event of our liquidity, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less taxes payable and up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the period of time provided in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted new rules and regulations for special-purpose acquisition companies SPACs ), which became effective on July 1, 2024 (the 2024 SPAC Rules ). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iii) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions and (iv) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. Recent Developments On January 5, 2024, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank, with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the initial public offering and private placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. On February 16, 2024, the Working Capital Note was amended to increase the principal sum from up to 300,000 to up to 750,000. In April 2024, the Second Promissory Note was amended to increase the principal sum from up to 750,000 to up to 1,250,000. On June 24, 2024, the Working Capital Note was further amended to increase the principal sum from 1,250,000 to 1,750,000. The Working Capital Note, as amended, bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of our initial Business Combination and (b) the date of the Company s liquidation. In 2024 the Company borrowed an aggregate of 1,168,500 under the terms of the Working Capital Note. On April 3, 2024, we held the Second Extension Meeting at which our shareholders approved the Second Charter Amendment for the Second Extension. In connection with the Second Charter Amendment we issued the Extension Note to our sponsor, pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to loan us up to 360,000 in connection with the extension of our termination date from April 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025. We first deposited in its Trust Account 40,000 on April 7, 2024, and has deposited thereafter and will continue to deposit in its Trust Account 40,000 on the 7th day of each subsequent month through January 7, 2025 for the benefits of Public Shares that were not redeemed in connection with the Second Extension that was approved at the Second Extension Meeting. In connection with the extension, shareholders holding 1,964,993 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in our Trust Account. As a result, approximately 21.87 million (approximately 11.13 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Immediately following the redemptions, there were 6,999,422 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding.

 On April 16, 2024, we received the Nasdaq Delisting Notice from the Nasdaq indicating that we did not regain compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule during the Extension Period, as defined below. On September 25, 2023, we received a written notice from the Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2), which requires the Company to maintain at least 400 total holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market (the Minimum Total Holders Rule ). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(B)(i), the maximum amount of time for the Company to regain compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule is 180 days, or until March 25, 2024 (the Extension Period ). We had requested a hearing before the Panel which stayed the suspension of trading on our securities, and our securities continued to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market while the hearing and the written decision by the Panel were in process. We appeared before the Panel on May 23, 2024. On June 17, 2024, we received a written notice from the Panel indicating it had granted our request for continued listing on the Exchange and transfer of its securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market from the Nasdaq Global Market, subject to the obligation that, on or before June 28, 2024, the Company will demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(2). On July 11, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Exchange approved the Company s application to list its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company s securities were transferred to the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on July 12, 2024. On July 26, 2024 the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company has demonstrated compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) and thus the Panel has determined to continue the listing of the Company s securities on the Exchange. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we had drawn additional 80,000 under the terms of the Extension Note to cover extension payments through December 7, 2024 making total borrowings of 320,000 under the Extension Note, and 176,000 under the terms of the Working Capital Note making total borrowings of 1,594,500 under the Working Capital Note.

Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our activities from February 3, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, the IPO and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 60,908, which consists of change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 822,000 and interest income on cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 332,296, offset by operating and formation costs of 1,093,388.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 5,852,864, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 6,502,003, change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 548,000 and other income attributable to derecognition of deferred underwriting fee allocated to offering costs of 214,220, offset by operating and formation costs of 1,411,359. Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete a Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete a Business Combination. Liquidity and Capital Resources On January 7, 2022, we completed the sale of 23,000,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 230,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 15,900,000 private placement warrants at a purchase price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 15,900,000. In August 2023, we issued the Second Promissory Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 300,000. On February 16, 2024, the Second Promissory Note was amended to increase the principal sum from up to 300,000 to up to 750,000. In April 2024, the Working Capital Note was amended to increase the principal sum from up to 750,000 to up to 1,250,000. On June 24, 2024, the Working Capital Note was further amended to increase the principal sum from 1,250,000 to 1,750,000. The Working Capital Note, as amended, bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the Company s initial business combination and (b) the date of the Company s liquidation. As of September 30, 2024, 1,418,500 was drawn and outstanding under terms of the Working Capital Note and further 331,500 may be borrowed under this note. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 1,166,160. Net loss of 7,815,226 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,264,295 and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 3,403,000. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 4,510,361 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 1,160,134. Net income of 5,852,864 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 6,502,003, change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 548,000 and other income attributable to derecognition of deferred underwriting fee allocated to offering costs of 214,220. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 251,225 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 25,938,425 (including 2,529,379 of interest income). We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 10,367. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination.

 On January 5, 2024, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank, with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the initial public offering and private placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. In April 2024, we issued the Extension Note to our sponsor, pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to loan us up to 360,000 in connection with the extension of the Company s termination date from April 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025. We first deposited in its Trust Account 40,000 on April 7, 2024, and has deposited thereafter and will continue to deposit in its Trust Account 40,000 on the 7th day of each subsequent month through January 7, 2025 for the benefits of Public Shares that were not redeemed in connection with the Second Extension that was approved at the Second Extension Meeting. We deposited a total of 120,000 and 240,000 in the Trust Account for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (the Working Capital Loans ). If we complete a Business Combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Loans. Liquidity and Going Concern We have until January 7, 2025 to consummate a Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by then, we may, however, elect to seek to extend the Combination Period consistent with applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules. Such an extension requires the approval of our shareholders, who will be provided the opportunity at that time to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares (which would likely have a material adverse effect on the amount held in the Trust Account and other adverse effects on us, such as our ability to maintain its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Should a Business Combination not occur, there may be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Additionally, we will not have sufficient liquidity to fund the working capital needs of the Company through January 7, 2025 or through twelve months from the issuance of this report. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the date of filing of this report. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after January 7, 2025. Contractual Obligations On January 4, 2022, we entered into an agreement to pay our sponsor an aggregate 930,000 over eighteen months beginning at the closing of the IPO, for the following administrative support expenses: (i) cash compensation to Mr. Goel, our Chief Executive Officer, in the form of an annual salary of 312,000; (ii) cash compensation to Mr. Coad, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in the form of an annual salary of 200,000; and (iii) 9,000 per month for office space, utilities and research, analytical, secretarial and administrative support, which the sponsor was expected to source principally from Cartica Management. In addition, at the closing of the IPO, we paid the sponsor an aggregate amount of 601,167 of which 549,000 represented compensation and bonuses paid to Mr. Goel and Mr. Coad for their services through the closing of the IPO and 51,667 represented a prepayment of administrative support expenses for January 2022, to be amortized over the service period. Upon completion of a Business Combination or our liquidation, we would have ceased paying these amounts (in the case of the officer compensation, after 30 days notice). On May 23, 2023, in connection with the Transfer, we and our sponsor entered into the Amended Administrative Support Agreement, pursuant to which we have ceased to pay our sponsor for (i) the cash compensation to the Chief Executive Officer in the form of an annual salary of 312,000 and (ii) 9,000 per month for office space, utilities, and research, analytical, secretarial and administrative support. Per the Amended Administrative Support Agreement our sponsor shall (i) pay to our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer an annual cash salary of 200,000, in substantially equal periodic installments, and bonuses of up to 150,000; and (ii) make available, or cause to be made available, to us, at a location mutually agreed by the Parties (or any successor location of sponsor), office space, utilities, and research, analytical, secretarial and administrative support, as may be reasonably required by us. In exchange for these services, we shall pay our sponsor 16,666.67 per month with the first payment due on or around May 31, 2023 and

 continuing monthly thereafter until the termination date as defined in the agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 50,000 and 150,000 of fees for these services, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 50,000 and 270,333 in fees for these services, respectively. We granted the underwriter a 45-day option from the date of the IPO to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. As of January 7, 2022, the over-allotment was fully exercised. The underwriter received a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 4,600,000 in the aggregate (which included an additional 600,000 received pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option), which was paid at closing of the IPO. In addition, the underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 8,050,000 in the aggregate (which included an additional 1,050,000 received pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option). The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On April 14, 2023, the underwriter terminated its association with us and waived any fees and compensation in connection with such association, including its entitlement to the payment of deferred compensation in the amount of 8,050,000 in connection with its role as our underwriter in our IPO. We entered into a forward purchase agreement with the Cartica Funds, pursuant to which the Cartica Funds agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of up to 3,000,000 forward purchase shares for 10.00 per share, or up to 30,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to close substantially concurrently with the closing of our Business Combination, subject to approval at such time by the Cartica Management investment committee. On October 13, 2022, we were advised by Cartica Management that the Cartica Funds will be liquidated in the first half of 2023. On March 14, 2023, we received a written notice from Cartica Management advising us that the investment committee of Cartica Management had determined that it would not approve the purchase of any forward purchase shares and therefore the Cartica Funds would not purchase any of the Forward Purchase Shares in connection with the Business Combination or otherwise. As a result, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate the Business Combination. On May 23, 2023, in connection with the Transfer, the Company and Cartica Funds entered into an agreement to terminate the rights and obligations of the Company and the Cartica Funds under Forward Purchase Agreement. In August 2023, we issued the Working Capital Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 300,000. On February 16, 2024, the Working Capital Note was amended to increase the principal sum from up to 300,000 to up to 750,000. In April 2024, the Working Capital Note was amended to increase the principal sum from up to 750,000 to up to 1,250,000. On June 24, 2024, the Working Capital Note was further amended to increase the principal sum from 1,250,000 to 1,750,000 (the Third Amendment ). The Working Capital Note, as amended, bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination and (b) the date of the Company s liquidation. 1,418,500 and 250,000 was outstanding under the Working Capital Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In April 2024, we issued the Extension Note to our sponsor, pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to loan us up to 360,000 in connection with the extension of our termination date from April 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025. We first deposited in its Trust Account 40,000 on April 7, 2024, and has deposited thereafter and will continue to deposit in its Trust Account 40,000 on the 7th day of each subsequent month through January 7, 2025 for the benefits of Public Shares that were not redeemed in connection with the Second Extension that was approved at the Second Extension Meeting. The Company has drawn eight installments of 40,000 under the terms of this note and deposited them in the Trust Account through the date of this report. We deposited a total of 120,000 and 240,000 in the Trust Account for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time when the accounting estimate was made; and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material amount on our financial condition or results of operations. We have identified management inputs used in the calculation of Company s warrant liabilities as critical accounting estimates. There are other items in our condensed financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed to be critical, as defined above. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and related judgements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Financial Statements included in this report. Warrant Liabilities A critical accounting estimate made in our condensed financial statements is the estimated fair value of our warrant liabilities. The fair value of our financial assets and liabilities reflects management s estimate of amounts that we would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, we seek to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: Level 1, Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not being applied. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Level 2, Valuations based on (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities, or (iv) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market through correlation or other means. Level 3, Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 27,400,000 warrants issued and outstanding, including 11,500,000 Public warrants classified as Level 1, and 15,900,000 Private warrants classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy of fair value measurements. Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of our condensed balance sheets. Net (Loss) Income Per Ordinary Share Net (loss) income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Subsequent measurement of the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from (loss) income per ordinary share as the redemption value approximates fair value. We calculate our earnings per share to allocate net income pro rata to Class A and Class B ordinary shares. This presentation contemplates a Business Combination as the most likely outcome, in which case, both classes of ordinary shares share pro rata in the income of our Company.

 Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas and introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s Management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its condensed financial statements and disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statement with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this report on that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
