 , Atlantic Community Bankers Bank ACBB stock with a carrying cost of , VISA Class B-2 stock with a carrying cost of , and Senior Housing Crime Prevention Investment Corporation ("SHCPFIC") preferred stock of at September 30, 2024. FHLB and ACBB stock was issued to the Bank as a requirement to facilitate the Bank s participation in borrowing and other banking services. The SHCPFIC stock was issued to the Bank to enable its participation in a Community Reinvestment Act qualified investment. The Bank owns shares of preferred stock of SHCPFIC. These shares are not transferable without the consent of SHCPFIC and do not have a readily determinable fair value. The Bank s investment in FHLB stock may fluctuate, as it is based on the member banks use of FHLB s services. The Bank has a non-controlling investment in a discrete class of non-voting limited liability company membership interests issued by National Energy Improvement Fund, LLC NEIF ), a Pennsylvania limited liability company licensed in Pennsylvania as a consumer discount company. The proceeds of the investment will be used by NEIF to fund a State-sponsored consumer loan program, the KEEP Home Energy Loan Program, designed to assist Pennsylvania homeowners in reducing their energy costs. The Bank owns shares of Visa Class B-2 common shares, which was necessary to participate in Visa services in support of the Bank s credit card, debit card, and related payment programs (permissible activities under banking regulations) as a member institution. Following the resolution of Visa s covered litigation, shares of Visa s Class B-2 stock will be converted to Visa Class A shares using a conversion factor as of September 26, 2024), which is periodically adjusted to reflect VISA s ongoing litigation costs. There is a very limited market for this stock, as only current owners of Class B-2 shares are permitted to transact in Class B-2. Due to the lack of orderly trades and public information of such trades, Visa Class B-2 stock does not have a readily determinable fair value. These restricted investments are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment periodically. As of September 30, 2024, there was impairment associated with these shares.

Loans secured by commercial real estate include all loans collateralized at least in part by commercial real estate. These loans may not be for the express purpose of conducting commercial real estate transactions. QNB generally lends in Bucks, Lehigh, and Montgomery counties in southeastern Pennsylvania. To a large extent, QNB makes loans collateralized at least in part by real estate. Its lending activities could be affected by changes in the general economy, the regional economy, or real estate values. The Company engages in a variety of lending activities, including commercial, residential real estate and consumer transactions. The Company focuses its lending activities on individuals, professionals and small to medium sized businesses. Risks associated with lending activities include economic conditions and changes in interest rates, which can adversely impact both the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the associated collateral. Commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and residential real estate loans with a business purpose are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans with a personal purpose and consumer loans. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers and are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay these loans depends on the successful operation of the borrower s business. The assets financed are used within the business for its ongoing operation. Repayment of these kinds of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversions of assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, to cash. Typical collateral for commercial and industrial loans includes the borrower s accounts receivable, inventory and machinery and equipment. Commercial real estate and residential real estate loans secured for a business purpose are originated primarily within the eastern Pennsylvania market area at conservative loan-to-value ratios and often backed by the individual guarantees of the borrowers or owners. Repayment of this kind of loan is dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale or lease of the subject property. Commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, as well as the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. Loans to state and political subdivisions are tax-exempt or taxable loans to municipalities, school districts and housing and industrial development authorities. These loans can be general obligations of the municipality or school district repaid through their taxing authority, revenue obligations repaid through the income generated by the operations of the authority, such as a water or sewer authority, or loans issued to a housing and industrial development agency, for which a private corporation is responsible for payments on the loans.

loan-to-value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance. The real estate-home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable-rate home equity lines of credit. Risks associated with loans secured by residential properties are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market. Since most loans are secured by a primary or secondary residence, the borrower s continued employment is the greatest risk to repayment. The Company offers a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than first or second mortgages on real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess and is more likely to decrease in value than real estate. Credit risk in this portfolio is controlled by conservative underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and, if secured, collateral values. The Company employs a ten-grade risk rating system related to the credit quality of commercial loans and loans to state and political subdivisions of which the first six categories are pass categories (credits not adversely rated). The following is a description of the internal risk ratings and the likelihood of loss related to each risk rating. 1. Excellent - no apparent risk 

 2. Good - minimal risk 

 3. Acceptable - lower risk 

 4. Acceptable - average risk 

 5. Acceptable higher risk 

 6. Pass watch 

 7. Special Mention - potential weaknesses 

 8. Substandard - well defined weaknesses 

 9. Doubtful - full collection unlikely 

 10. Loss - considered uncollectible 

 The Company maintains a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans. Each loan officer assigns a risk rating to all loans in the portfolio at the time the loan is originated. Loans are generally reviewed annually based on the borrower s fiscal year and the dollar amount of the relationship. Loans with risk ratings of seven through ten are reviewed at least quarterly, and as often as monthly, at management s discretion. The Company also utilizes an outside loan review firm to review the portfolio on a semi-annual basis to provide the Board of Directors and senior management an independent review of the Company s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. These reviews are designed to recognize deteriorating credits in their earliest stages in an effort to reduce and control risk in the lending function as well as identifying potential shifts in the quality of the loan portfolio. The examinations by the outside loan review firm include the review of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans, monitoring the risk of existing loans and to provide timely follow-up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality. In addition, the outside firm reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans. The following tables present the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aggregate pass rating and the classified ratings of special mention, substandard and doubtful within the Company s internal risk rating system as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

As previously discussed, the Company maintains a loan review system, which includes a continuous review of the loan portfolio by internal and external parties to aid in the early identification of potential impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. When placing a loan on non-accrual status, management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. All non-accrual loans, except student loans, are individually evaluated for an allowance for credit losses ("ACL"). This ACL is measured using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. An ACL is established for a non-accrual loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of the majority of the Company s non-accrual loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral less costs to sell. For commercial loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes individually evaluated, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property. For commercial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower s financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable agings or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of

The new issue market is also inactive and there are currently very few market participants who are willing and able to transact for these securities. Given conditions in the debt markets today and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets, we determined: The few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for purposes of determining fair value at September 30, 2024; 

 An income valuation approach technique (present value technique) that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than the market approach valuation technique used at prior measurement dates; and 

 The PreTSL will be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because significant adjustments are required to determine fair value at the measurement date. 

 QNB used an independent third party to value this security using a discounted cash flow analysis. Based on management s review of the bond s underlying issuers, there are expected credit losses or prepayments; cashflows used were contractual based on the Bloomberg YA screen. The assumed cashflows have been discounted using an estimated market discount rate based on the -year swap rate. The 30-year is used as the reference rate since it is indicative of market expectation for short-term rates in the future. This is consistent with the 30-year nature of the PreTSL security, which is priced using the 3-month LIBOR as a reference rate. The discount rate of includes the risk-free rate, a credit component and a spread for illiquidity. The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of QNB s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between QNB s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of each major classification of financial instrument and non-financial asset at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: Cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable (carried at cost) : The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet approximate those assets fair value. Investment securities (including derivative instruments) (carried at fair value) : The fair value of securities is primarily determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. Level 2 debt securities are valued by a third-party pricing service commonly used in the banking industry. Level 2 fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution date,

Standby letters of credit 

Total financial instrument commitments 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. QNB evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party. QNB s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Standby letters of credit of will expire within . The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending other loan commitments. The Company requires collateral and personal guarantees supporting these letters of credit as deemed necessary. Management believes that the proceeds obtained through a liquidation of such collateral and the enforcement of personal guarantees would be sufficient to cover the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the corresponding guarantees. The amount of the liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for guarantees under standby letters of credit issued is not material. The amount of collateral obtained for letters of credit and commitments to extend credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral varies, but may include real estate, accounts receivable, marketable securities, pledged deposits, inventory or equipment. Other commitments : QNB has committed to various operating leases for several of their branch and office facilities. Some of these leases include specific provisions relating to rent increases. Some of the leases contain renewal options to extend the initial terms of the lease for periods ranging from five to and certain leases allow for multiple exten sions. There were lease renewals durin g the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

million in aggregate principal amount of its Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2034 (the "Subordinated Notes"). The Subordinated Notes were offered and sold by the Company to the Subordinated Note Purchasers in a private offering in reliance on the Section 4(a)(2) exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the provisions of Regulation D thereunder. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and potential future strategic opportunities. The Subordinated Notes mature on and bear interest at a fixed annual rate of , payable in arrears, to but excluding September 1, 2029. From and including September 1, 2029 to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum initially equal to the then-current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. The Company is entitled to redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 1, 2029, and to redeem the Subordinated Notes at any time in whole upon certain other events. Any redemption of the Subordinated Notes will be subject to prior regulatory approval to the extent required. The Subordinated Notes are not subject to any sinking fund and are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Subordinated Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. The Subordinated Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any subsidiary of the Company. The Subordinated Notes rank junior in right to payment to the Company's current and future senior indebtedness. The Subordinated Notes are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The carrying cost of the Subordinated Notes on the balance sheet represents the outstanding balance of the notes net of unamortized origination costs of which are amortized to interest expense through September 1, 2029.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Disclosure of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference. Some of these policies are particularly sensitive requiring significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - OVERVIEW 
 QNB reported net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 3,338,000, or 0.91 per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of 2,344,000, or 0.65 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, QNB reported net income of 8,397,000, or 2.29 per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of 8,349,000, or 2.32 per share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2023. The Bank contributed 8,466,000 to net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8,568,000 for the same period 2023; and the holding company had a negative contribution of 69,000 to net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a negative 219,000 for the same period 2023. The results at the Bank were primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans and unused commitments and an increase in non-interest expense, partly offset by an increase in net interest income. The results at the holding company are due primarily to less unrealized losses on equity securities included in the investment portfolio. 
 Net income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average shareholders equity was 0.72 and 8.13 , respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with 0.52 and 5.88 , respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the annualized rate of return on average assets and average shareholders' equity was 0.62 and 6.95 , respectively, compared with 0.64 and 7.13 , for the same period in 2023. 
 Total assets as of September 30, 2024 were 1,841,563,000, compared with 1,706,318,000 at December 31, 2023. Loans receivable at September 30, 2024 were 1,171,361,000, a 77,828,000 increase from 1,093,533,000 at December 31, 2023. Total deposits of 1,626,284,000 at September 30, 2024 increased 137,571,000 compared with total deposits of 1,488,713,000 at December 31, 2023. 
 Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the following significant components: 
 Net interest income increased 914,000, or 8.95 , to 11,127,000 and 1,924,000, or 6.42 , to 31,887,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis increased ten basis points for the quarter and five basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, at 2.48 and 2.45 to compared to 2.38 and 2.40 for the same periods in September 30, 2023, respectively. 

QNB recorded 154,000 in its provision for credit losses on loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with 452,000 for the same period in 2023. QNB recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of 193,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a reversal of 1,119,000 in its provision for credit losses on loans for the same period in 2023. 

Non-interest income increased 212,000, to 1,967,000 for the third quarter and increased 714,000, to 5,268,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023. Excluding realized and unrealized gains (losses) on securities, non-interest income decreased 162,000, or 9.2 , to 1,600,000 for the quarter and decreased 389,000, or 7.7 , to 4,634,000 for the nine months September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023. 

42 

Non-interest expense decreased 35,000 to 8,636,000 for the quarter and increased 1,040,000 to 26,403,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 

Total non-performing loans, comprised of loans on non-accrual status, were 1,696,000, or 0.14 of loans receivable at September 30, 2024, compared to 1,940,000, or 0.18 of loans receivable at December 31, 2023. Net loan charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 58,000, compared with net recoveries of 219,000 for the same period in 2023. 

These items, as well as others, are explained more thoroughly in the next sections. 
 NET INTEREST INCOME 
 QNB earns its net income primarily through the Bank. Net interest income, or the spread between the interest, dividends, and fees earned on loans and investment securities and the expense incurred on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, is the primary source of operating income for QNB. Management seeks to achieve sustainable and consistent earnings growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk levels approved by the Board of Directors. 
 The following table presents the adjustment to convert net interest income to net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Net interest income is the primary source of operating income for QNB. Net interest income is interest income, dividends, and fees on earning assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources. Earning assets primarily include loans, investment securities, interest bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal funds sold. Sources used to fund these assets include deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing deposits. 
 For purposes of this discussion, interest income and the average yield earned on loans and investment securities are adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis as detailed in the tables that appear above. This adjustment to interest income is made for analysis purposes only. Interest income is increased by the amount of savings of Federal income taxes, which QNB realizes by investing in certain tax-exempt state and municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax-exempt organizations. In this way, the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more easily compared. 
 The net interest rate spread is the difference between average rates received on earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the net interest rate margin, which includes interest-free sources of funds, is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee works to manage and maximize the net interest margin for the Company.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Quarterly Comparison 
 Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 were 1,807,091,000, an increase of 80,335,000, or 4.7 , from the third quarter of 2023, with average loans increasing 119,075,000, or 11.5 , average other interest earning assets increasing 33,360,000, primarily interest-earning cash at the Federal Reserve Bank, and average investment securities decreasing 72,100,000, or 11.5 , over the same period in 2023. Cash generated from repayments and sales on the investment portfolio supported loan growth. Average loans as a percent of average earning assets was 64.1 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 60.2 for the third quarter of 2023. On the funding side, average deposits increased 112,293,000, or 7.5 , to 1,600,925,000 for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in time deposits and money market products. Average short-term borrowed funds, which consisted primarily of average commercial repurchase agreements, short-term Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") borrowing and over-night FHLB borrowings, decreased 61,490,000 to 34,078,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 95,568,000 for the same period in 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the QNB Corp. issued 40,000,000 of subordinated debt; the carrying value net of deferred costs was 39,030,000 at September 30, 2024. Proceeds from deposit growth and the issuance of subordinated debt were were used to support loan growth. 
 46 

The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 increased ten basis points to 2.48 from 2.38 for the same period in 2023. Competition for quality loans and deposits in our local market continues to exert pressure on the net interest margin. Repricing strategies on loans and deposits and the sale of lower-yielding investments have had a positive impact on the net interest margin. Two interest rate swaps entered into in 2023 added five basis points to the increase in net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024. The net interest margin is expected to improve as loans and deposits reprice. 
 The Rate-Volume Analysis tables, as presented on a tax-equivalent basis, highlight the impact of changing rates and volumes on interest income and interest expense. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased 3,441,000, or 18.5 , to 22,082,000 for the third quarter of 2024; total interest expense increased 2,534,000 to 10,818,000. 
 The yield on earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis increased 58 basis points to 4.86 for the third quarter of 2024, from 4.28 for the third quarter of 2023. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.90 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 2.35 for the same period in 2023. 
 Interest income on investment securities (available-for-sale and equity) increased 94,000 when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The average yield on the investment portfolio was 2.90 for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 2.50 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 40 basis points of which the interest rate swaps contributed 30 basis points. 
 The yield on U.S. Treasury securities was 4.94 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.17 for the same period in 2023. The yield on U.S. Government agency securities increased seven basis points offset by a decrease in average balances of 25,991,000, for a net reduction in interest income of 59,000. 
 Interest income on municipal securities, which are primarily tax-exempt, increased 88,000 due to a 44 basis-point increase in rate, partly offset by a 3,483,000 decrease in average balances. The rate and interest income increases on municipal securities was positively impacted by the interest rate swap, contributing 45 basis points of the increase in rate. Typically, QNB purchases municipal bonds with 10- to 20-year maturities and may have call dates between 2-10 years. 
 Interest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs decreased 47,000 and average balances decreased 49,488,000 while the yield increased 31 basis points. The rate and interest income increases on mortgage-backed securities were positively impacted by the interest rate swap, contributing 32 basis points. This portfolio generally provides higher yields relative to agency bonds and also provides monthly cash flow which can be used for liquidity purposes or can be reinvested as interest rates increase. Since most of these securities were purchased at a premium, any prepayments result in a shorter amortization period of this premium and therefore a reduction in income. 
 The dividend yield on equities decreased nine basis points as average balances decreased 994,000. Proceeds from sales of equities were reinvested in higher yielding treasury securities. 
 Income on loans increased 2,902,000 to 16,773,000 when comparing the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, with an 119,075,000 increase in average balances contributing to an increase in interest income of 1,583,000 and a 47-basis point increase in yield contributing to a 1,319,000 increase in interest income. Higher interest rates during the repricing period were partially offset by competitive pressures that compressed the yields on new loans. 
 The largest category of the loan portfolio is commercial real estate loans. This category of loans includes commercial purpose loans secured by either commercial properties such as office buildings, factories, warehouses, hotels and restaurants, medical facilities and retail establishments, or residential real estate, usually the residence of the business owner. The category also includes construction and land development loans. Income on commercial real estate loans increased 2,237,000 when comparing the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, primarily due to a 50-basis point increase in rate from 5.10 in 2023 to 5.60 and increased average balances of 96,258,000, or 13.3 . 
 Income on commercial and industrial loans increased 353,000 when comparing the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. The average yield on these loans increased 38 basis points to 7.61 resulting in an increase in income of 134,000; average balances increased 12,379,000, to 140,980,000 for the third quarter of 2024 resulting in a 219,000 increase in interest income. Many of the loans in this category are indexed to the prime interest rate. 
 Tax-exempt loan income increased 1,000 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Average balances decreased 1,325,000, or 6.7 , to 18,305,000 for the third quarter of 2024. The yield on municipal loans increased 29 basis points, to 3.88 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. 
 QNB desires to be the local consumer lender of choice , focusing its retail lending efforts on product offerings and marketing and promotion. Interest income on residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family increased 143,000 when comparing the third 
 47 

quarter of 2024 to the same period in 2023. Average residential mortgage loan balances increased by 3,428,000, or 3.2 , to 110,760,000 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, which contributed a 33,000 increase in interest income. The average yield on the portfolio increased 40 basis points and contributed an increase of 110,000 to interest income. QNB chose to retain certain mortgage loans instead of selling them in the secondary market, as the yield on our originated mortgages was higher than comparable mortgage-backed securities. Average home equity loans increased during the 2024 period by 8,545,000 to 66,239,000 and the average yield increased 19 basis points to 6.84 resulting in a 171,000 increase in interest income. The yield on the consumer portfolio increased 22 basis points to 7.75 for the third quarter of 2024 and there was a 210,000 decrease in average balances resulting in a net 3,000 decrease in interest income. The decrease in consumer loans was primarily due to the repayment of student loan balances. 
 Earning assets are funded by deposits and borrowed funds. Interest expense increased 2,534,000, when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period in 2023. QNB experienced average balance increases in all deposit categories except non-interest-bearing checking, municipal deposits and savings accounts. Average non-interest-bearing demand accounts decreased 12,750,000 to 192,652,000 for the third quarter of 2024. Average savings balances decreased 47,320,000 to 278,247,000. QNB offered several new interest-bearing demand and money market products offering higher yields to retain large depositors and reduce the reliance on higher-cost short-term borrowings. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased 37,428,000, or 11.7 , to 356,763,000 for the third quarter of 2024 and the average rate paid on these deposits increased 26 basis points; interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts increased 298,000 to 898,000 for the same period. Average money market accounts increased 37,217,000, or 18.5 , to 238,494,000 for the third quarter of 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Interest expense on money market accounts increased 605,000 to 2,132,000, and the average interest rate paid on money market accounts increased 55 basis points to 3.56 for the third quarter of 2024. Most of the balances in this category are in products that pay tiered rates based on account balances. 
 Interest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased 14,000 to 1,823,000 for the third quarter of 2024. The average interest rate paid on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased six basis points to 4.69 for the third quarter of 2024 over the same quarter of 2023, and average balances decreased 2,772,000 to 154,619,000. Many of these accounts are indexed to the Federal funds rate with rate floors. Municipal deposits are seasonal in nature and are received during the second and third quarters as tax receipts are collected and are withdrawn over the course of the year. 
 Interest expense on savings accounts decreased 142,000 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same quarter of 2023. The average interest rate paid on savings accounts increased one basis point to 1.28 for the third quarter of 2024. When comparing these same periods, average savings accounts decreased 47,320,000, or 14.5 , to 278,247,000 for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to decreases in the e-Savings product. QNB s online e-Savings product is the largest category of savings deposits, with average balances for the third quarter of 2024 of 202,810,000 compared to 236,589,000 in the same period of 2023. The average yield paid on these accounts was 1.72 for the third quarter of 2024 and 1.68 for the same period in 2023. Traditional statement savings accounts, passbook savings and club accounts are also included in the savings category and average balances in these types of savings accounts decreased 13,541,000 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period in 2023. 
 Interest expense on time deposits totaled 4,196,000 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,320,000 in 2023. Average total time deposits increased 100,490,000 to 380,150,000 for the third quarter of 2024. As with fixed-rate loans and investment securities, these deposits reprice over time and, therefore, have less of an immediate impact on costs in either a rising or falling rate environment; however, the maturity and repricing characteristics of time deposits tend to be shorter. The average rate paid on total time deposits increased 110 basis points from 3.29 to 4.39 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period in 2023. 
 Approximately 342,787,000, or 90 , of time deposits at September 30, 2024 will mature over the next 12 months. The average rate paid on these time deposits is approximately 4.50 . The yield on the time deposit portfolio may change in the next quarter as short-term time deposits reprice; however, given the short-term nature of these deposits, interest expense may increase if short-term time deposit rates were to increase suddenly or if customers select higher paying time deposits. 
 Short-term borrowings are comprised of sweep accounts structured as repurchase agreements with our commercial customers, overnight FHLB borrowing and short-term FRB borrowing. Interest expense on short-term borrowings decreased 554,000 for the third quarter of 2024 to 186,000 when compared to the same period in 2023. When comparing these same periods, average balances decreased 61,490,000 to 34,078,000. The yield on customer repos increased 54 basis points for the third quarter of 2024 to 2.18 . There were no FHLB borrowings during 2024. During the first quarter of 2023, QNB borrowed 50,000,000 from the FRB under its Bank Term Funding Program and locked in a rate of 4.39 ; there are no pre-payment penalties. The FRB borrowings were paid off during the first quarter of 2024; there was an average balance of 50,000,000 for the third quarter of 2023 compared to no average balance in the third quarter of 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, QNB borrowed an additional 10,000,000 in long-term debt to lock in borrowing at a lower yield than short-term borrowings. Average long-term borrowings increased 10,000,000 and the interest rate increased 39 basis points when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period in 2023. 
 
 48 

During the third quarter of 2024, the QNB Corp. issued 40,000,000 of subordinated debt; the carrying value net of deferred costs was 39,030,000 at September 30, 2024. The average yield of 9.42 includes the amortization of the deferred costs. The subordinated debt will initially bear interest at 8.875 per annum from and including the original issue date of the subordinated notes to but excluding September 1, 2029, payable semi-annually in arrears. From September 1, 2029, through maturity or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate resets quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus a spread, payable quarterly in arrears. On or after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date through maturity, the QNB has the option to redeem the subordinated debt, in whole or in part, on any scheduled interest payment date. QNB may also redeem the subordinated debt in whole at any time in the event of certain specified events. The subordinated debt will mature on September 1, 2034. 
 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Nine-Month Comparison 
 
 For the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024 average earning assets increased 71,447,000, or 4.2 , to 1,764,751,000, with average loans increasing 10.3 and average investment securities decreasing 11.0 . Average total deposits increased 103,474,000, or 7.2 , to 1,547,290,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 2.45 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a five-basis point increase from the same period in 2023. 
 
 Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased 12,008,000, or 23.9 , to 62,275,000 from 50,267,000, when comparing the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 due to an increase in volume and rate on loans. Interest income on loans increased 3,931,000 as a result of volume and increased 4,646,000 as a result of yields. Interest income on investments increased 2,882,000 due to rate, partly offset by a decrease of 828,000 due to volume. The analysis of the nine-month comparison periods is similar to what was described in the quarterly analysis. 
 
 The yield on earning assets increased from 3.97 to 4.71 for the nine-month periods with the yield on loans up 52 basis points to 5.65 . QNB continues to experience pressure on yields due to competitive pressures on loan pricing. 
 
 Total interest expense increased 10,110,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 attributable to an increase in rates. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased 88 basis points to 2.72 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023. The average balance of total short-term borrowings decreased 54,844,000 primarily due to short-term FRB and overnight FHLB borrowings. The yield on interest-bearing liabilities increased 81 basis points to 2.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. QNB invested proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in deposits into loans and to payoff short-term borrowing. 
 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON UNUSED COMMITMENTS 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended ("ASU 326") , which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected credit losses CECL for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. On January 1, 2023, QNB recorded a decrease to its allowance for credit losses on loans of 989,000 and an increase to its allowance for credit losses on unused commitments of 5,000. 
 The provision for credit losses represents management's determination of the amount necessary to be charged to operations to bring the allowance for credit losses on loans and the allowance for credit losses on unused commitments to amounts that are intended to absorb historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, in the outstanding loan portfolio and the unused commitments. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of these allowances and that it has established its existing allowances for credit losses on loan and on unused commitments in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The determination of an appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses on loans and the allowance for credit losses on unused commitments are based upon an analysis of the risks inherent in QNB s loan portfolio. 
 Since the allowance for credit losses on loans and the reserve on unused commitments is dependent, to a great extent, on conditions that may be beyond QNB s control, it is at least reasonably possible that management s calculations and actual results could differ. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB s allowance for credit losses on loans. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, serve to reduce the allowance. 
 Based on this analysis, QNB recorded 193,000 in the provision for credit losses on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, through the allowance for credit losses on loans, compared to a reversal of 1,119,000 through the provision for credit losses for the same period in 2023. QNB recorded a reversal of provision of 6,000 for the allowance for credit losses for unused commitments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a reversal of 18,000 for the same period in 2023. 
 49 

QNB's allowance for credit losses on loans of 8,987,000 represents 0.77 of loans receivable at September 30, 2024 compared with an allowance for credit losses on loans of 8,852,000, or 0.81 of loans receivable, at December 31, 2023, and 8,542,000, or 0.81 , at September 30, 2023. Management believes the allowance for credit losses on loans at September 30, 2024 is adequate as of that date based on its analysis of historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in the portfolio. 
 Net charge-offs were 25,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net charge-offs of 275,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Charge-offs consisted of overdrafts of 22,000, student loans of 17,000 and other consumer loans of 14,000. Recoveries of approximately 28,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 20,000 in repayments from borrowers of previously charged-off credits and overdrafts recoveries of 8,000. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans receivable were 0.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to annualized net charge-offs of 0.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net charge-offs were 58,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net recoveries of 219,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Charge-offs of approximately 143,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of a commercial loan of 23,000, student loans of 23,000, consumer loans of 22,000 and overdrafts of 75,000. These were offset by 85,000 in recoveries comprising 63,000 in repayments from borrowers of previously charged-off credits, and 22,000 related to overdraft recoveries. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans receivable were 0.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to annualized net recoveries of 0.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-performing assets were 1,696,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1,940,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 1,893,000 at September 30, 2023. Total non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and restructured loans, were 0.14 of loans receivable at September 30, 2024, 0.18 at December 31, 2023, and 0.18 of loans receivable at September 30, 2023. In cases where there is a collateral shortfall on non-accrual loans, specific impairment reserves have been established based on updated collateral values even if the borrower continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. At September 30, 2024, 1,021,000, or approximately 60 of the loans classified as non-accrual are current or past due less than 30 days. Commercial loans classified as substandard or doubtful totaled 26,833,000, an increase of 15,223,000 from the 11,610,000 reported at December 31, 2023 and an increase of 14,919,000 from the 11,914,000 reported at September 30, 2023. The increase in classified loans since December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 was due to two commercial relationships downgraded. 
 QNB had no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, or September 30, 2023. Total loans 30 days or more past due, which includes non-accrual loans by actual number of days delinquent, represented 0.18 of loans receivable at September 30, 2024 compared with 1.09 at December 31, 2023, and 0.97 at September 30, 2023. The December 31, 2023 past-dues included one large relationship past maturity and in the process of refinancing. 
 There were no modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty identified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. QNB had no other real estate owned or repossessed assets at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 or September 30, 2023. 
 
 A loan is considered collateral dependent, based on current information and events, if it is probable that QNB will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining if a loan is collateral dependent include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not collateral dependent. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Deficiency is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for all non-accrual loans, except student loans, by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

Quarter to Quarter Comparison 
 Total non-interest expense was 8,636,000 for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 35,000 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Salaries and benefits comprise the largest component of non-interest expense. QNB monitors, through the use of various surveys, the competitive salary and benefit information in its markets and makes adjustments when appropriate. Salaries and benefits expense decreased 321,000, or 6.5 , to 4,650,000 when comparing the two quarters. Salary expense and related payroll taxes increased 77,000, or 1.9 to 4,209,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to pay increases and filling open positions. Medical and dental premiums, net of employee contributions, decreased 400,000 when comparing the two quarters due to a reduction in medical claims. 
 Net occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses combined increased 27,000 when comparing the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. This is due primarily to increased software maintenance expense. Marketing expense decreased 19,000, or 8.8 , to 197,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, due to timing of advertising campaigns. 
 Third-party services are comprised of professional services, including legal, accounting, auditing and consulting services, as well as fees paid to outside vendors for support services of day-to-day operations. These support services include correspondent banking services, IT services, statement printing and mailing, investment security safekeeping and supply management services. Third party services expense increased 69,000, due to legal and audit costs. Telephone, postage and supplies expense decreased 14,000 primarily due to a reduction in supplies, postage and mailing expenses as there was an increase in the use of electronic delivery. State taxes increased 89,000 due to the timing of tax credits received for qualified charitable contributions. FDIC insurance premiums increased 67,000 due to an increase in the assessment rate. 
 53 

Other non-interest expense increased 67,000, or 7.3 , due to an increase in write-offs due to fraud on customer accounts of 44,000 and an increase in debit card expense of 50,000 , partly offset by a decrease in loan related costs of 23,000. 
 
 Nine-Month Comparison 
 
 Total non-interest expense was 26,403,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1,040,000, or 4.1 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Salaries and benefits expense increased 353,000 to 14,662,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Salary and related payroll tax expense increased 373,000 during the period, to 12,451,000. 
 
 Net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased 179,000, or 4.1 , to 4,527,000, due to the reasons described in the quarter to quarter comparison. Marketing expenses increased 13,000 due to advertising and promotions. Third-party services increased 109,000, or 5.9 , to 1,946,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Telephone, postage and supplies expense decreased 65,000 due to the reasons described above in the quarter to quarter comparison. 
 
 FDIC insurance premiums increased 283,000 and state taxes increased 221,000, due to the reasons described in the quarter to quarter comparison. 
 
 Other non-interest expense decreased 53,000 due to a reduction in write-offs due to fraud on customer accounts of 263,000 as the Bank was able to recover some losses from prior periods, partly offset by an increase in debit card expense of 170,000 and the recording of a potential expense of 85,000 related to the Visa stock exchange make-whole agreement. 
 INCOME TAXES 
 QNB utilizes an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. As of September 30, 2024, QNB s net deferred tax asset was 16,841,000. The primary components of deferred taxes are deferred tax assets of which 14,931,000 relates to investment securities fair value adjustments, 1,068,000 related to interest rate swap fair value adjustments and 1,927,000 relates to the allowance for credit losses on loans, partly offset by a deferred tax liability on deferred loan costs of 527,000. As of December 31, 2023, QNB s net deferred tax asset was 19,290,000 of which 17,692,000 is related to investment securities fair value adjustment and 1,859,000 related to the allowance for credit losses on loans. The decrease in the balance of net deferred tax assets when comparing September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023 of 2,449,000 is due to the unrealized gains on available for sale securities contributing a reduction of 2,761,000, partly offset by unrealized losses on interest rate swaps contributing 701,000. 
 The realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the generation of future taxable income, the existence of taxes paid and recoverable, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Based upon these and other factors, management believes it is more likely than not that QNB will realize the benefits of these remaining deferred tax assets except for a 95,000 deferred tax asset related to a state net operating loss. 
 Applicable income tax expense was 961,000 for the quarter and 2,168,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 494,000 for the quarter and 1,942,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was 22.4 and 20.5 , respectively, compared with 17.4 and 18.9 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a higher percentage of taxable income and the recording of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS 
 Financial service organizations are challenged to demonstrate they can generate sustainable and consistent earnings growth in a dynamic operating environment. Rate competition for quality loans is anticipated to continue through 2024. It is also anticipated that the rate competition for attracting and retaining deposits may increase in the remainder of 2024, which could result in a lower net interest margin and a decline in net interest income. 
 QNB s primary business is accepting deposits and making loans to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves. Loans are the most significant component of earning assets and growth in loans to small businesses and residents of these communities has been a primary focus of QNB. Inherent within the lending function is the evaluation and acceptance of credit risk and interest rate risk. QNB manages credit risk associated with its lending activities through portfolio diversification, underwriting policies and procedures and loan monitoring practices. QNB is committed to make credit available to its customers.

Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 1,841,563,000 compared with 1,706,318,000 at December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents increased 41,575,000 from 62,657,000 at December 31, 2023 to 104,232,000 at September 30, 2024. 
 The fixed-income securities portfolio represents a significant portion of QNB s earning assets and is also a primary tool in liquidity and asset/liability management. QNB actively manages its fixed income portfolio to take advantage of changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in spread relationships in different sectors and for liquidity purposes. Management continually reviews strategies that will result in an increase in the yield or improvement in the structure of the investment portfolio, including monitoring credit and concentration risk in the portfolio. The available-for-sale securities portfolio increased 19,854,000, due to purchases of 56,223,000 and improvement in the fair value mark of 11,390,000; this was partly offset maturities and prepayments of 38,693,000 and sales of 13,139,000. 
 Loans receivable increased 77,828,000 with commercial loans increasing 69,503,000 to 988,918,000 at September 30, 2024, compared with 919,415,000 at year-end 2023 and retail loans increasing 8,545,000 over the same period. 
 Deposits grew 137,571,000 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased 5,142,000, with balances of 190,240,000 at September 30, 2024 compared with 185,098,000 at year-end 2023. Interest-bearing demand balances, excluding municipal deposits, increased 38,827,000 to 368,779,000, with increases in business interest-bearing checking products. The 19,174,000 increase in money market accounts was primarily due to the premium money market product offered to both personal and business customers. The 30,803,000 decrease in savings was primarily due to declines in the E-Savings on-line product as some of these funds moved to higher-yield certificates of deposit or the premium money market accounts. Total time deposits increased 65,654,000 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 as customers took advantage of higher-yielding time deposits, moving from lower-yielding products. Municipal deposit balances increased 39,577,000, to 172,337,000, during the first nine months of 2024. Municipal deposits can be volatile depending on the timing of deposits and withdrawals, and the cash flow needs of the school districts or municipalities. Municipal deposits increase as tax money is received from the local school districts during second and third quarters and it is anticipated that these funds will flow out for the subsequent twelve months as the schools use the funds for operations. These deposits provide an incremental funding source as they are used to fund loans as opposed to borrowing at a higher rate; this improves the net interest margin as it increases the spread related to the net interest margin. 
 Short-term borrowings decreased 75.6 , from 94,094,000 at December 31, 2023 to 22,918,000 at September 30, 2024. Commercial sweep accounts decreased 21,176,000; these funds may be volatile based on businesses receipt and disbursement of funds and is offset by business non-interest-bearing demand accounts. During the first quarter of 2023, QNB borrowed 50,000,000 from the FRB under its Bank Term Funding Program and locked in a rate of 4.39 , there are no pre-payment penalties; these borrowing were paid off during the first quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, QNB borrowed an additional 10,000,000 in long-term debt from the FHLB increasing it's total to 30,000,000 to lock in a low yield. During the third quarter of 2024, QNB issued 40,000,000 in subordinated debt. Details can be found in Note 13. 
 LIQUIDITY 
 Liquidity represents an institution s ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals. QNB attempts to manage its mix of cash and interest-bearing balances, Federal funds sold and investment securities to match the volatility, seasonality, interest sensitivity and growth trends of its loans and deposits. The Company manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs. Liquidity is provided from asset sources through repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities. The portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale and QNB's policy of selling certain residential mortgage originations in the secondary market also provide sources of liquidity. Core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements have historically been the most significant funding source for QNB. These deposits and repurchase agreements are generated from a base of consumers, businesses and public funds primarily located in the Company s market area. 
 Additional sources of liquidity are provided by the Bank s membership in the FHLB. At September 30, 2024 the Bank had a maximum borrowing availability with the FHLB of approximately 398,683,000, which is net of long-term borrowing outstanding of 30,000,000, a 283,000 letter of credit and accrued interest payable. The maximum borrowing depends upon qualifying collateral assets and the Bank s asset quality and capital adequacy. In addition, the Bank maintains unsecured Federal funds lines with four correspondent banks totaling 86,000,000. At September 30, 2024 there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines. Future availability under these lines is subject to the policies of the granting banks and may be withdrawn. 
 Liquid sources of funds, including cash, available-for-sale and equity investment securities, and loans held-for-sale have increased 58,024,000 since December 31, 2023, totaling 617,322,000 at September 30, 2024. The increase in the liquid sources of funds is primarily due to an increase in cash due to the proceeds from the issuance on subordinated debt. Growth in deposits provided cash flows of 137,571,000 and proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and subordinated debt provided 50,000,000; combined, the proceeds 
 55 

enabled the net paydown on short-term borrowings of 71,176,000 and funding for the net growth in loans of 77,886,000. Management expects these liquid sources will be adequate to meet normal fluctuations in loan demand or deposit withdrawals. The investment portfolio is expected to continue to provide sufficient liquidity, as municipal bonds are called or mature and cash flow on mortgage-backed and CMO securities continues to be steady. 
 Approximately 261,595,000 and 289,935,000 of available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and deposits of public funds and the FRB short-term borrowing. The level of pledged securities corresponds with the municipal deposit and repurchase agreement balances. 
 QNB is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services (CDARS) program offered by the Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. CDARS is a funding and liquidity management tool used by banks to access funds and manage their balance sheet. It enables financial institutions to provide customers with full FDIC insurance on time deposits over 250,000 that are placed in the program. QNB also has available Insured Cash Sweep (ICS), another program through Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC, which is a product similar to CDARS, but one that provides liquidity like a money market or savings account. 
 CAPITAL ADEQUACY 
 A strong capital position is fundamental to support continued growth and profitability and to serve the needs of depositors. QNB's shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024 was 105,340,000, or 5.72 of total assets, compared with shareholders' equity of 90,824,000, or 5.32 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 included a negative adjustment of 58,607,000 compared to a negative adjustment of 67,937,000 at December 31, 2023, related to net unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available-for-sale and gains on fair value hedges, net of tax. Without these adjustments, shareholders' equity to total assets would have been 8.63 and 8.95 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Average shareholders' equity and average total assets were 161,458,000 and 1,811,051,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.2 and 4.2 , respectively, from the averages for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The ratio of average total equity to average total assets was 8.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.01 for the same period in 2023. 
 Retained earnings at September 30, 2024 were impacted by nine months of net income totaling 8,397,000 offset by dividends declared and paid of 4,071,000 for the nine-month period. QNB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan to provide participants a convenient and economical method for investing cash dividends paid on the Company s common stock in additional shares. The Plan also allows participants to make additional cash purchases of stock. Stock purchases under the Plan contributed 657,000 to capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 200,000 shares of QNB common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not bear a termination date. As of September 30, 2024, 102,000 shares have been repurchased since the initial authorization at an average price of 24.93 and a total cost of 2,543,000. 
 QNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. Regulatory capital is defined in terms of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Risk-based capital ratios are expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various weights to all assets and off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and loan commitments, based on associated risk. 
 The required minimum Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio is 4.5 , the required minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is 6.0 , the required minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets is 8.0 , and the required minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 4.0 . A capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets also applies to avoid limitations on certain capital distributions.

At September 30, 2024, common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 regulatory capital ratios to risk-weighted assets and the leverage ratio decreased since December 31, 2023 primarily due to the growth in loans; however, the total capital ratio to risk-weighted assets ratio improved due to the issuance of subordinated debt. The Company remains well-capitalized by all applicable regulatory requirements as of September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices. QNB s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and liquidity risk. QNB s liquidity position was discussed in a prior section. 
 QNB s largest source of revenue is net interest income, which is subject to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk management seeks to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins and interest rate spreads and to provide growth in net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. QNB s Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for managing interest rate risk and for evaluating the impact of changing interest rate conditions on net interest income. 
 QNB uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation considers current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates assumptions for growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios. 
 A balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its assets (investment securities and loans) reprice faster than its interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). An asset sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively higher net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline. A balance sheet is considered liability sensitive when its liabilities (deposits and borrowings) reprice faster than its earning assets (investments securities and loans). A liability sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively less net interest income when interest rates rise and more net interest income when they decline. Based on our simulation analysis, management believes QNB s interest sensitivity position at September 30, 2024 is asset sensitive. Management expects that market interest rates may decrease over the next 12 months, based on the economic environment and policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
 The following table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 assuming instantaneous rate shocks, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the subsequent twelve months is projected to decrease when interest rates are higher than current rates.

Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel. 
 Changes in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect QNB s interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt. At September 30, 2024, QNB had two derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments; these interest rate swaps had a notional value of 300,000,000. 
 QNB is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk.
