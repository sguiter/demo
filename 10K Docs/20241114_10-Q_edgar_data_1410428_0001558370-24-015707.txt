The Company applies the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 in the accounting for acquisitions of businesses. ASC 805 requires the Company to use the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the aforementioned amounts. While the company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately apply preliminary values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. As of September 30, 2024, impairment of the Company s goodwill was required. The purchase accounting for the acquisition remains incomplete as management continues to gather and evaluate information about circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for intangible assets. Although the Company believes the assumptions and estimates that have been made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets the Company has acquired include future expected cash flows, and discount rates. For income tax purposes, this acquisition of of the units is treated as an asset acquisition. As a result of the acquisition of Naples Wax, the company generated tax deductible goodwill of .

 from continuing operations. As of September 30, 2024, deferred tax assets generated from the Company s U.S. activities were offset by a valuation allowance because realization depends on generating future taxable income, which, in the Company s estimation, is not more likely than not to be generated before such net operating loss carryforwards expire. Net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017, do not expire. The Company expects its effective tax rate for its current fiscal year to be significantly lower than the statutory rate as a result of a full valuation allowance; therefore, any loss before income taxes does not generate a corresponding income tax benefit. Income tax expense/(benefit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was , which was attributed to state taxing jurisdictions in which a measure of income is utilized to determine a tax liability.

Bernstein, and directors Michael Lebowitz, Robert Weinstein, Ga lle Wizenberg, and Scott R. Milford (the Action ). In the Action, CPC alleged, in pertinent part, that the Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties and that the Company and Board of Directors engaged in an unlawful, unenforceable, and inequitable application of the Company s Third Amended and Restated Bylaws to reject CPC s notice of intent to propose its own slate of directors for election at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on April 16, 2024, as subsequently amended on April 17, 2024 and April 29, 2024 (the Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any future reports we file with the SEC. The forward-looking statements set forth herein speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to we, us and our refer to XWELL, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview XWELL is a global wellness company operating multiple brands and focused on bringing restorative, regenerative and reinvigorating products and services to travelers. XWELL currently has four reportable operating segments: XpresSpa , XpresTest , Naples Wax Center and Treat . On October 25, 2022, we changed our name to XWELL, Inc. XWELL or the Company from XpresSpa Group, Inc. Our common stock, par value 0.01 per share, which had previously been listed under the trading symbol XSPA on the Nasdaq Capital Market, now trades under the trading symbol XWEL . We filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State on October 24, 2022 (the Amended and Restated Certificate reflecting the name change. Rebranding to XWELL aligned our corporate strategy to build a pure-play wellness services company, in both the airport and off airport marketplaces. Although we recognize four segments of business, we believe there is opportunity to leverage a segment of our products and services across the Company s platform of brands. Additionally, we are expanding our retail strategy, not only adding more products for sale but aligning those products more efficiently to our service offerings. This product strategy includes, for example, adding muscle relaxation patches to a neck or back massage to continue treatment after the delivery of the service. We are also continuing to add new service offerings to our in and out of airport locations. We also plan to build our capability for delivering health and wellness services outside of the airport. We believe operating outside of the airport complements our offering and represents the fastest way to scale the XWELL family of brands. We will be looking to further expand internationally. With international travel returning to pre-pandemic levels, we continue to be opportunistic in our approach, by taking advantage of the current market to growth. We believe a strategy for international expansion further advances our ability to expand our other brands including bio surveillance outside of the United States.

 XpresSpa XWELL s subsidiary, XpresSpa Holdings, LLC XpresSpa has been a global airport retailer of spa services through our XpresSpa spa locations, offering travelers premium spa services, including massage, nail and skin care, as well as spa and travel products. As of September 30, 2024, there were 19 domestic XpresSpa locations in total, 17 Company-owned locations and two franchises. We also had 10 international locations operating as of September 30, 2024, including two XpresSpa locations in Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, one XpresSpa location in Zayad International Airport in Abu Dhabi, UAE, three XpresSpa locations in Schiphol Amsterdam Airport in the Netherlands and four XpresSpa locations in the Istanbul Airport in Turkey. XpresTest We, in partnership with certain COVID-19 testing partners, successfully launched its XpresCheck Wellness Centers, in June of 2020, through our XpresTest, Inc. subsidiary XpresTest ), which offered COVID-19 and other medical diagnostic testing services to the traveling public, as well as airline, airport and concessionaire employees, and TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents during the pandemic. During 2022 and 2023, as countries continued to relax their testing requirements resulting in rapid decline of testing volumes at the Company s XpresCheck Wellness locations, the Company started to close XpresCheck Wellness Centers. As of December 31, 2023, we have closed all XpresCheck Wellness locations. XpresTest began conducting bio surveillance monitoring with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with Concentric by Ginkgo BioWorks in 2021 and on January 31, 2022, we announced the extension of our initial program, bringing the total contract to 5,537. In August 2022, the program was renewed in partnership with Ginkgo BioWorks. A new two-year contract was initiated which represents approximately 7,330 in revenue (for the first year) for the XpresTest segment. The program was further renewed in August 2023 through a new one-year contract. The revenue to XpresTest from such one-year extension totaled approximately 7,044. In March 2024, the program funding and scope were expanded, a revenue increase of 4,000, to an estimated 11,044 in revenue for XpresTest with a new collection station located in Miami International Airport (MIA) and the roll out of multi-pathogen testing across the program. The program was further renewed in August 2024. HyperPointe XWELL s subsidiary, gcg Connect, LLC, operating as HyperPointe, provides direct to business marketing support across a number of health and health-related channels. From the creation of marketing campaigns for the pharmaceutical industry, to learning management systems to website and health related content creation, HyperPointe is a complementary service provider to our health-focused brands as well as providing the majority of services to the external community. For reporting purposes, HyperPointe has been consolidated into the XpresTest segment. Treat Treat, which is operating through our subsidiary Treat, Inc. Treat is a wellness brand that provides access to wellness services for travelers at on-site centers (currently located in JFK International Airport). In April 2024, the decision was made to close the location in the Salt Lake City International Airport. Treat offers a full retail product offering and a suite of wellness and spa services. Travelers can purchase time blocks to use our wellness rooms to engage in interactive services like self-guided yoga, meditation, and low impact weight exercises or to relax and unplug from the hectic pace of the airport and renew themselves before or after their trip.

 Naples Wax Center On September 12, 2023, we acquired our subsidiary Naples Wax, LLC d/b/a Naples Wax Centers Naples Wax Centers or Naples Wax ), a group of upscale hair removal boutiques in Florida, for a purchase price of 1,624. Aiming to provide a memorable customer experience, Naples Wax Center operates three high-performing locations with core products and service offerings from face and body waxing to a range of skincare and cosmetic products. The acquisition of Naples Wax Center is intended to enable us to move beyond our airport client base with a business that can be adapted to a larger wellness platform while also growing our retail footprint to serve our long-term financial goals. XWELL Studios In Q4 of 2023, we began plans to open our first XWELL Studios location in Jacksonville, Florida in 2025. XWELL Studios is an out-of-airport concept providing leased space to established wellness service providers. Revenue will be derived from both lease payments received from the wellness practitioners and the sale of retail at the wellness center. We believe that these strategic imperatives will be accomplished through development of an infrastructure specifically focused on enabling scalable and efficient growth. Recent Developments August 2024 Registered Direct Offering On August 6, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue in a registered direct offering (the August 2024 Offering ), an aggregate of 652,705 shares (the August 2024 Shares of our common stock. The gross proceeds to us from the August 2024 Offering, prior to deducting estimated fees and expenses, were approximately 1.4 million. The August 2024 Offering closed on August 8, 2024. The August 2024 Shares were offered and sold by us pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-273726), previously filed with the SEC on August 4, 2023, and declared effective by the SEC on September 29, 2023, and the base prospectus included therein. 2023 Reverse Stock Split On September 28, 2023, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split ), whereby every twenty shares of our common stock were reduced to one share of our common stock and the price per share of our common stock was multiplied by 20. All references to shares and per share amounts, including shares of common stock underlying stock options, warrants, and applicable exercise prices, have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented herein to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split as required in accordance with US GAAP. Results of Operations Revenue We recognize revenue from the sale of XpresSpa, Treat and Naples Wax services when they are rendered at our stores and from the sale of products at the time goods are purchased at our stores or online (usually by credit card), net of discounts and applicable sales taxes. During the third quarter of 2022, XpresTest, in partnership with Ginkgo BioWorks in continuation of their support to the CDC s traveler-based SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program was awarded a new contract. We recognize revenue over time for both sample collection performance obligations, using the input method based on time elapsed to measure progress towards satisfying each of the performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue ratably (straight line basis) over the term of the contract (one year).

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 4,365 (excluding restricted cash), 11,660 in marketable securities, and total current assets of 19,513. Our total current liabilities balance, which includes accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued expenses, and operating lease liabilities was 9,850 as of September 30, 2024, and 9,330 as of December 31, 2023. The working capital surplus was 9,663 as of September 30, 2024, compared to a working capital surplus of 17,236 as of December 31, 2023. We have carried out an assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the next twelve months. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for the maintenance of our current XpresSpa and Treat locations and brand, as well as the expansion of Naples Wax and our off-airport strategy. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used 7,541 and 12,873 in operations, respectively.

Under this stock repurchase program, management has discretion in determining the conditions under which shares may be purchased from time to time. The program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.

Table of Contents 
 information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Remediation Plan for Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is committed to the remediation of the Company s material weaknesses, as well as the continued improvement of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management has implemented, and continues to implement, the actions described below to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses. Until the remediation efforts described below, including any additional measures management identifies as necessary, are completed, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist. We cannot provide any assurance that the below remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. Management has commenced the following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on an ongoing basis: 1) The Company has turned on the multi-currency features related to its cloud-based accounting systems. 2) The Company has engaged outside service providers to assist with the valuation, accounting, and recording of key reporting areas such as leases, revenue recognition and stock compensation expense. 3) The Company has contracted an independent consulting firm to assist with the preparation of the Financial Statements and U.S. GAAP accounting research. 4) The Company has engaged outside service providers to review the applicable complementary user entity controls described in the service organizations reports for their potential impact on the Company s financial reporting. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as set forth in the foregoing paragraph, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
