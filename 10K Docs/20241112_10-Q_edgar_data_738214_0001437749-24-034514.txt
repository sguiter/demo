 The Company evaluates leases in accordance with ASC 842 Lease Accounting . When discount rates implicit in leases cannot be readily determined, we use the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to perform lease classification tests on lease components and to measure lease liabilities and right of use (ROU) assets. The incremental borrowing rate used by the Company is based on weighted average baseline rates commensurate with the Company s secured borrowing rate over a similar term. At each reporting period when there is a new lease initiated, the rates established for that quarter are used.

 Inducement Equity Plan 
 
 In March 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an Inducement Equity Plan authorizing the issuance of non-statutory stock options to purchase common stock. This plan was not approved by stockholders, and as a result is available only for grants to prospective employees. As of September 30, 2024 , there are no option grants outstanding under the Inducement Equity Plan. 
 
 Stock-based Compensation Expense 
 
 Stock-based compensation is accounted for in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees, directors, and consultants based on estimated fair value on the grant date. We estimate the fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize that fair value as an expense over the vesting period of each grant using the straight-line method. We only record compensation cost for vested options. The Black-Scholes valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term (the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility of our common stock, a risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected forfeitures. We use the simplified calculation of expected term described in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14, Share-Based Payment . Volatility is based on an average of the historical volatility of Aemetis, Inc. common stock during the period of time preceding the date of option issuance that matches the term of the option grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the treasury maturity term corresponding with the expected life of the option. We use an expected dividend yield of zero, as we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Expected forfeitures are assumed to be zero due to the small number of plan participants. To the extent actual forfeitures occur, the difference is recorded as an adjustment in the scheduled expense during the period of the forfeiture. 
 
 The weighted average fair value calculations for the options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , are based on the following assumptions: 

Risk-free interest rate 
 Expected volatility 
 Expected life (years) 
 Market value per share on grant date

 Overview 
 
 Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Cupertino, California, Aemetis, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis referred to herein as Aemetis, the Company, we, our or us is an international renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company focused on the operation, acquisition, development, and commercialization of innovative technologies to produce low and negative carbon intensity renewable fuels that replace fossil-based products. We do this by building a local circular bioeconomy using agricultural products and waste to produce low carbon, advanced renewable fuels that reduce greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and improve air quality. 
 
 Our California Ethanol segment consists of a 65 million gallon per year capacity ethanol production facility located in Keyes, California (the Keyes Plant that we own and operate. In addition to low carbon renewable fuel ethanol, the Keyes Plant produces Wet Distillers Grains WDG ), Distillers Corn Oil DCO ), and Condensed Distillers Solubles CDS ), all of which are sold as animal feed to more than 80 local dairies and feedlots. We also capture the Carbon Dioxide CO 2 emissions from our fermenters and sell it to Messer Gas for use to produce liquid CO that it sells to food, beverage, and industrial customers. We are implementing several energy efficiency initiatives focused on lowering the carbon intensity of our fuels, primarily by decreasing the use of fossil natural gas. These energy efficiency projects include high efficiency heat exchangers; a two-megawatt solar microgrid with battery storage that became operational in the second quarter; a Decision Control System (DCS) to manage and optimize energy use and other plant operations; and a Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) system that is expected to replace about 80 of our natural gas consumption with low carbon electricity. These changes are expected to lower the carbon intensity (CI) of the ethanol we produce and allow us to sell it for a correspondingly higher price. 
 
 Our California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas segment, Aemetis Biogas or ABGL, operates anaerobic digesters at local dairies near the Keyes Plant (many of whom also purchase WDG produced by the Keyes Plant as animal feed) to produce biogas from dairy waste; transports the biogas by pipeline to the Keyes Plant site; and converts the biogas to Renewable Natural Gas RNG that is delivered to customers through the PG E regional natural gas pipeline. As of September 30, 2024, we had nine operating digesters that receive dairy waste from ten dairies, and we are actively growing with an additional five digesters currently under construction that are expected to receive dairy waste from eight dairies. We expect to initiate construction on several additional digesters in the fourth quarter when we close on currently planned debt financing. We have constructed 36 miles of collection pipeline and have received environmental approval to construct an additional 24 miles. We currently have agreements with a total of 44 dairies and are seeking to increase that number. 
 
 Our India Biodiesel segment includes a biodiesel production plant in Kakinada, India Kakinada Plant with a nameplate production capacity of about 60 million gallons per year. It produces high quality distilled biodiesel and refined glycerin for customers in India. We believe the Kakinada Plant is one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in India on a nameplate capacity basis. The Kakinada Plant can process a variety of vegetable oils and animal fat waste feedstocks into biodiesel that meets applicable product standards. Our Kakinada Plant can also distill the crude glycerin byproduct from the biodiesel refining process into refined glycerin, which is sold to the pharmaceutical, personal care, paint, adhesive, and other industries. 
 
 Our planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD) production plant is currently designed to produce 90 million gallons per year of combined SAF and RD from feedstocks consisting of renewable waste oils and fats. Our planned facility will be located at the Riverbank Industrial Complex in Riverbank, California. We signed a lease with an option to purchase for the Riverbank Industrial Complex in 2021 and took possession of the site in 2022. In 2023, we received a Use Permit and CEQA approval for the SAF/RD plant, and in March 2024, we received Authority to Construct air permits for the plant. We are continuing with development activities, including permitting, engineering, and financing. The site has access to low carbon hydroelectric power, and our plant is designed to use renewable hydrogen that will be produced from byproducts of the SAF/RD production process. 
 
 Our planned CCUS projects will compress and inject CO into deep wells that are monitored to ensure the long-term sequestration of carbon underground. California s Central Valley has been identified as one of the world s most favorable regions for large-scale CO injection projects due to the subsurface geologic formation that absorbs and retains CO gas. The two initial Aemetis CCUS injection projects are being designed to capture and sequester more than two million metric tons per year of CO at the Aemetis biofuels plant sites in Keyes and Riverbank, California. In July 2022, Aemetis purchased 24 acres at the Riverbank Industrial Complex in Riverbank, California to develop a CCUS injection well with more than 1 million metric ton per year of CO sequestration capacity. In 2023, we obtained a permit to construct a geologic characterization well at the Riverbank site to obtain information to support an EPA Class VI CO injection well permit application. Once operational, we expect that these projects will generate revenue by selling California LCFS credits and federal Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q tax credits.

We operate in a volatile market in which we have limited control over the major components of input costs and product revenues and are making investments in future facilities and facility upgrades that improve overall margins while lessening the impact of these volatile markets. As such, we expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods primarily because of changes in the prices for corn, ethanol, WDG, DCO, CDS, biodiesel, waste fats and oils, glycerin, non-refined palm oil, natural gas, LCFS credits, and D3 RINs as well as the timing of the sales of environmental attributes held in inventory. To the extent that we experience periods in which the spread between ethanol prices and corn and energy costs narrows or the spread between biodiesel prices and waste fats and oils or palm oil and energy costs narrow, we require additional working capital to fund operations. 
 
 As a result of negative capital and negative operating results, and collateralization of substantially all the Company assets, we have been reliant on our senior secured lender to extend the maturity dates of our debt and loan facilities. In order to meet obligations during the next twelve months, we will need to either refinance our debt or receive the continued cooperation of its senior lender. We plan to pursue the following strategies to improve the course of the business. 
 
 For the Keyes Plant, we plan to operate the plant and continue to improve its financial performance by adopting new technologies or process changes that increase energy efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance revenue, as well as execute upon awarded grants that improve energy and operational efficiencies resulting in lower cost, lower carbon intensity, and overall margin improvement. 
 
 For our dairy RNG production, we plan to continue to operate our existing digesters as well as continue to build new dairy digesters and extend the existing pipeline. Funding for continued construction has been based on government guaranteed debt financing and grant programs. We are seeking multiple sources of additional project funding to allow us to accelerate the addition of new digesters. We began generating revenue from D3 RIN sales in 2023 and first generated revenue from the sale of LCFS credits in January 2024. We expect to have a full year of revenue from both sources in 2024, which will provide increased liquidity. 
 
 For the Kakinada Plant, we plan to continue to enter cost-plus contracts with the OMCs as our primary customers. We also plan to continue to upgrade our plant to increase capacity and expand feedstock flexibility. We are also evaluating the production of additional products and developing channels for the export of allow. The Kakinada plant has had positive gross income during the last two years and we expect this to continue. We also will continue to rely on our working capital lines with Gemini and Secunderabad Oils to fund our commercial arrangements for the acquisitions of feedstock. 
 
 For the Riverbank SAF/RD production plan, we are continuing with engineering and other development activities and seeking both debt and equity funds needed for development and construction. 
 
 In addition to the above, we plan to continue to locate funding for existing and new business opportunities through a combination of working with our senior lender, restructuring existing loan agreements, seeking project specific debt and equity, selling equity through the ATM and otherwise, selling the current EB-5 Phase II offering, and by vendor financing arrangements. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of principal, interest and fees, net of discounts, on all Third Eye Capital Notes was 205.3 million. The maturity dates for the Third Eye Capital financing arrangements are March 1, 2025, for 39.3 million; March 1, 2026, for 140.6 million; and, April 1, 2026, for 25.4 million based on the Company's option to extend the maturity.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period. We believe that of our most significant accounting policies and estimates, defined as those policies and estimates that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain are: revenue recognition; recoverability of long-lived assets, Series A Preferred unit liability, and debt modification and extinguishment accounting. These significant accounting principles are more fully described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, although remediation plans were initiated to address the material weaknesses over financial reporting as identified in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the disclosure controls and procedures along with the related internal controls over financial reporting were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and is compiled and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 As discussed in greater detail under Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued implementing a remediation plan to address the material weakness in our internal control related to information technology general controls and information technology systems.
