The complaint, styled Abduladhim A. Alghazwi, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. The Beauty Health Company, Andrew Stanleick, Liyuan Woo, and Michael Monahan, Case No. 2:23-cv-09733 (C.D. Ca.) (the Securities Class Action ), asserts claims for violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all defendants (First Claim), and violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants (Second Claim). The complaint alleges that, between May 10, 2022 and November 13, 2023, defendants materially misled the investing public by publicly issuing false and/or misleading statements and/or omissions relating to Hydrafacial's business, operations, and prospects, specifically with respect to the performance of and demand for the Syndeo 1.0 and 2.0 devices. The relief sought in the complaint includes a request for compensatory damages suffered by the plaintiff and other members of the putative class for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the alleged securities violations.

competing motions for appointment as lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act PSLRA ), 17 U.S.C. 78u-4(a)(3). On January 31, 2024, Joseph Jou filed a notice of non-opposition to the Browns and Dijkgraafs motions for appointment as lead plaintiff. On May 2, 2024, the court granted the Dijkgraafs motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and approved the Dijkgraafs counsel, Hagens Berman, as lead counsel. On May 9, 2024, the parties submitted a joint stipulation to the court setting forth a proposed schedule for the filing of an amended complaint and defendants response thereto. The proposed schedule has not yet been approved by the court. On July 1, 2024, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint asserting the same causes of action as the original complaint. The Securities Class Action case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint in its entirety. Plaintiffs opposition brief is due on November 22, 2024, the Company s reply brief is due December 23, 2024, and the hearing on the motion is set for January 15, 2025. 
 
 The Company believes that the claims asserted in the Securities Class Action have no merit and intends to vigorously defend them.

 On October 24, 2024, Jason Davalos, Sonia Davalos, and Sol Tan Tanning Spa LLC Class Action Plaintiffs ), individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint against Hydrafacial LLC d/b/a The Hydrafacial Company and The Beauty Health Company (collectively, the Class Action Defendants for alleged violations of New York consumer fraud statutes, breach of contract, and common law breach of implied warranties (the Consumer Class Action ). The case is captioned Jason Davalos, Sonia Davalos, Sol Tan Tanning Spa LLC, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. Hydrafacial LLC dba The Hydrafacial Company, and The Beauty Health Company, Case No. 24-cv-8073 (S.D.N.Y.) (Caproni, J.) The complaint alleges that all three versions of the Syndeo machine (Syndeo 1.0, Syndeo 2.0, and Syndeo 3.0) were defective and did not perform in the manner in which it had been represented by Class Action Defendants. Class Action Plaintiffs claim that Class Action Defendants made various misrepresentations in its marketing and sales of the Syndeo machines and, rather than provide a refund to customers for the defective machines, replaced them with another Syndeo machine that exhibited the same defects. Class Action Plaintiffs purport to bring claims on behalf of themselves, and all other similarly situated purchasers within the United States, of Class Action Defendants Syndeo machines. The complaint asserts five causes of action: (1) violations of N.Y. G.B.L., 349, the state consumer production statute; (2) violations of N.Y. G.B.L., 350, the state s false advertising statute; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; and (5) breach of the implied warranty of fitness. The relief sought in the complaint includes monetary damages allegedly suffered by Class Action Plaintiffs and other members of the putative class as a result of Class Action Defendants alleged violations and breaches, including a trebling of any money damages award for alleged violations of N.Y. G.B.L., 349 and 350. 
 
 The Company believes that the claims asserted in the Consumer Class Action have no merit and Class Action Defendants intend to vigorously defend them. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, and, accordingly, it has not accrued any liability associated with the Consumer Class Action.

 Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the Company , Hydrafacial , we , us , and our in this section are intended to mean the business and operations of The Beauty Health Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 The Beauty Health Company is a global category-creating company delivering skin health experiences that help consumers reinvent their relationship with their skin, bodies and self-confidence. The Company and its subsidiaries design, develop, manufacture, market, and sell esthetic technologies and products. The Company s brands are pioneers: Hydrafacial in hydradermabrasion; SkinStylus in microneedling; and Keravive in scalp health. Together, with its powerful global community of estheticians, partners and consumers, the Company is personalizing skin health for all ages, genders, skin tones, and skin types. 
 
 23 

Business and Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we continued to execute against our plan to expand our footprint by selling and placing our patented hydradermabrasion delivery systems Delivery Systems worldwide, drive consumables, which consist of single-use tips, solutions, serums and other consumables used to provide a hydrafacial treatment that cleanses, extracts, and hydrates the skin (collectively Consumables ), invest in our community of providers, partners, and consumers, drive brand awareness, and optimize our global infrastructure. Although we believe we can be successful in our current operating environment, various factors may impact our business in unpredictable ways such as: 
 Disruptions in transportation and other supply chain related constraints, such as labor strife in the transportation industry; 
 Global economic conditions, including inflation, recession, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher interest rates, and other changes in economic conditions; and 
 Ongoing issues related to new and older models of Hydrafacial s current generation Delivery System, Syndeo, and our actions to remediate such ongoing issues. The Company provided, at no cost to the customer, the option of (i) a technician upgrade to their Syndeo 1.0 or 2.0 devices to 3.0 standards in the field; or (ii) a replacement Syndeo 3.0 device for their existing device (the Syndeo Program ). The Company executed replacements under the Syndeo Program and continues to address customer cases under warranty. As of September 30, 2024, the Syndeo Program is complete. 
 
 We may be able to offset cost pressures through increasing the selling prices of some of our products, increasing value engineering efforts to optimize product costs, increasing the diversification of our suppliers and supplier contracts, increasing natural foreign currency hedging, as applicable, and reducing discretionary spending. However, our pricing actions could have an adverse impact on demand, and may in turn, cause our providers to halt or decrease Delivery Systems and/or Consumables spending, and our actions may not be sufficient to cover unexpected increased costs that we may experience. 
 
 Business and macroeconomic factors may also negatively impact, in the short-term or long-term, the global economy, the beauty health industry, our providers and their budgets with us, our business, the Company s brand reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. We remain attentive to these business and macroeconomic conditions that may materially impact our business, and we continue to explore and implement reporting and quality management systems and risk mitigation strategies so that the Company can remain agile in responding to changing circumstances.

Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. 
 
 Our sources of liquidity and cash flows are used to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products, services, and technologies, and provide ongoing support services for our providers and customers, including liabilities associated with the recently completed Syndeo Program . As part of our business strategy, we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and products and technologies. Accordingly, a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products, services, or businesses. Such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses into our current operations, or expand into new markets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurances that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
 
 Based on our sources of capital, management believes that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements for our ongoing operations and obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, we will continue to evaluate our capital expenditure needs based upon factors including but not limited to our rate of revenue growth, potential acquisitions, the timing and amount of spending on research and development, growth in sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product launches, timing and investments needed for international expansion, the continuing market acceptance of the Company s products and services, expansion, and overall economic conditions. 
 
 We may, from time to time, seek to redeem or repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. For information regarding the Company s repurchases of its Notes during the first and second quarter of 2024, see Note 7, Long-Term Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 30 

If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain expanded credit facilities to fund our operating expenses. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Also, the incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. In the event such additional capital is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. However, if cash flows from operations become insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional capital were obtained, then management would restructure the Company in a way to preserve our business while maintaining expenses within operating cash flows. 
 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 
 On September 14, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 750.0 million in principal amount of its Notes. The Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture dated as of September 14, 2021, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Indenture ). Pursuant to the purchase agreement between the Company and the initial purchasers of the Notes, the Company granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the Notes were first issued, up to an additional 100.0 million principal amount of Notes. The Notes issued on September 14, 2021 include the 100.0 million principal amount of Notes issued pursuant to the full exercise by the initial purchasers of such option. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no repurchases related to the Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, t he Company repurchased 192.3 million principal amount of the Notes for 156.1 million. 
 
 Capped Call Transactions 
 
 On September 9, 2021, in connection with the pricing of the offering of Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Base Capped Call Transactions with the Bank of Montreal, Credit Suisse Capital LLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Mizuho Markets Americas LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (collectively, the Option Counterparties ). In addition, on September 10, 2021, in connection with the initial purchasers exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company entered into additional capped call transactions (the Additional Capped Call Transactions , and together with the Base Capped Call Transactions, the Capped Call Transactions with each of the Option Counterparties. The Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock that initially underlie the Notes, and are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company s Class A Common Stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially 47.94, which represents a premium of 100 over the last reported sale price of the Company s Class A Common Stock on September 9, 2021. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was 90.2 million. 
 
 The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions, each between the Company and the applicable option counterparty, and are not part of the terms of the Notes and do not affect any holder s rights under the Notes or the Indenture. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. 
 
 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 
 
 On November 14, 2022, the Company, as successor by assumption to Hydrafacial, a California limited liability company, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as it may be further amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Administrative Agent ). The Credit Agreement provided the Company with a 50.0 million revolving credit facility that had a maturity date of November 14, 2027. 
 
 On August 6, 2024, the Company prepaid all obligations and terminated all commitments, liabilities, and other obligations under the Credit Agreement. There were no material early termination penalties incurred in connection therewith, all outstanding obligations and commitments under the Credit Agreement were satisfied and terminated, and all related security interests and liens securing such obligations and commitments were released. 
 31 

Known Tren ds or Uncertainties 
 
 The majority of our customers operate within the medical industry (dermatologists and plastic surgeons), esthetician industry, and beauty retail industry. Although we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date due to consolidations, we have seen some consolidation in these industries during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total net sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industries continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward. 
 
 In addition, we continue to face macro-economic challenges such as the possibility of recession or financial market instability, and the impact of any governmental actions on the economy. These factors may adversely impact consumers, business, and government spending as well as our customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. 
 
 If economic and social conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, our revenues could be adversely affected. Macro-economic challenges and credit conditions have negatively impacted our revenues in 2024. We are continuing to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business so that we can respond appropriately. Negative trends in our financial performance or financial condition may result in a sustained decline in our stock price, which may result in a triggering event necessitating an interim goodwill impairment assessment and potential goodwill impairment. 
 
 Discontinuation of Trade-up Program in 2024 
 
 The Company has historically accepted Delivery Systems in trade-up transactions with the intent to refurbish and resell such Delivery Systems received from the customer. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized approximately 12 million and 17 million, respectively, of revenue based on the estimated fair value of such Delivery Systems. While the Company still expects to resell Delivery Systems previously received in trade-up transactions, starting in 2024, the Company discontinued the use of trade-up transactions and the ensuing revenue recognition for noncash consideration. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes the activities from our statements of cash flows. Amounts may not foot due to rounding.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders equity/deficit, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions. 
 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Part I, Item 1 "Financial Statements Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements New Accounting Pronouncements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, foreign currency, and inflation risk. There were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s inventory process as described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Inventory Material Weakness ), the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 33 

Remediation Plan for Material Weakness 
 
 The Company, with oversight from its Audit Committee, is in the process of implementing measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation plan includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
 
 hiring additional personnel, both internal and external, with the necessary experience and skill to manage supply chain and inventory operations ; and 
 enhancing controls, including the implementation of manual or automated processes over the physical existence of inventory, identification of excess and obsolete inventory, and authorization of inventory pricing and purchase arrangements. 
 
 Although the Company believes that these actions will remediate the material weakness, additional time is required to test such actions and to complete the design, implementation, and review its controls to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Company s remediation efforts. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
