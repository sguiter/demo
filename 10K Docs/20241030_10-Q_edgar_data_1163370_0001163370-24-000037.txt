available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position without an ACL. At September 30, 2024, the Company had held to maturity securities in an unrealized loss position without an ACL. Management does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the previous table are due to noncredit-related factors, primarily changes in interest rates, and therefore no losses have been recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, carrying amounts of million and million in securities were pledged for deposits and borrowings, respectively.

 Credit Quality Information 
 As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management utilizes a loan risk grading system called the Asset Quality Rating AQR system to assign a risk classification to each of its loans. The risk classification is a dual rating system that contemplates both probability of default and risk of loss given default. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 10 and, loans graded 1 6 are considered pass grade loans. Loans graded 7 or higher are considered classified loans. A description of the general characteristics of the AQR risk classifications are as follows: 
 Pass grade loans 1 through 6: The borrower demonstrates sufficient cash flow to fund debt service, including acceptable profit margins, cash flows, liquidity and other balance sheet ratios. Historic and projected performance indicates that the borrower is able to meet obligations under most economic circumstances. The borrower has competent management with an acceptable track record. The category does not include loans with undue or unwarranted credit risks that constitute identifiable weaknesses. 
 
 Classified loans: 
 Special Mention 7: A special mention credit has weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset at some future date. 
 
 Substandard 8: A substandard credit is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Northrim Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful 9: An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one that is classified "substandard-8" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The loan has substandard characteristics, and available information suggests that it is unlikely that the loan will be repaid in its entirety. 
 
 Loss 10: An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the books is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.

Changes in value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the MSR held is calculated independently without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in others, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

 The Company has an interest rate swap to hedge the variability in cash flows arising out of its junior subordinated debentures, which is floating rate debt, by swapping the cash flows with an interest rate swap which receives floating and pays fixed. The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company's interest payments on the million of junior subordinated debentures held under Northrim Statutory Trust 2 at through its maturity date. The floating rate that the dealer pays was equal to the three month LIBOR plus through September 15, 2023. The floating rate that the dealer pays is now equal to the three month CME SOFR plus tenor spread adjustment plus , which reprices quarterly on the payment date.

 Except as otherwise noted, references to we , our , us or the Company refer to Northrim BanCorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. 
 Note Regarding Forward Looking-Statements 
 This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements, as that term is defined for purposes of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements describe management s expectations about future events and developments such as future operating results, growth in loans and deposits, continued success of the Company s style of banking, and the strength of the local economy. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, regarding our financial position, business strategy, management s plans and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. We use words such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend and similar expressions in part to help identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current plans and expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations, and those variations may be both material and adverse. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from our expectations as indicated in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include: potential further increases in interest rates; the value of securities held in our investment portfolio; the impact of the results of government initiatives on the regulatory landscape, natural resource extraction industries, and capital markets; the impact of declines in the value of commercial and residential real estate markets, high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and slowdowns in economic growth; changes in banking regulation or actions by bank regulators; inflation, supply-chain constraints, and potential geopolitical instability, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; financial stress on borrowers (consumers and businesses) as a result of higher rates or an uncertain economic environment; the general condition of, and changes in, the Alaska economy; our ability to maintain or expand our market share or net interest margin; the sufficiency of our provision for credit losses and the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to current expected credit losses accounting guidance; our ability to maintain asset quality; our ability to implement our marketing and growth strategies; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks, including security breaches, denial of service attacks, hacking, and identity theft; disease outbreaks; and our ability to execute our business plan. Further, actual results may be affected by competition on price and other factors with other financial institutions; customer acceptance of new products and services; the regulatory environment in which we operate; and general trends in the local, regional and national banking industry and economy. In addition, there are risks inherent in the banking industry relating to collectability of loans and changes in interest rates. Many of these risks, as well as other risks that may have a material adverse impact on our operations and business, are identified in Part II. Item 1A Risk Factors of this report and Part I. Item 1A in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, you should be aware that these factors are not an exhaustive list, and you should not assume these are the only factors that may cause our actual results to differ from our expectations. In addition, you should note that forward looking statements are made only as of the date of this report and that we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements or the uncertainties that may adversely impact those statements, other than as required by law.

Update on Economic Conditions 
 
 The Alaska Department of Labor DOL has reported Alaska s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August of 2024 was 4.6 compared to the U.S. rate of 4.2 . The total number of payroll jobs in Alaska, not including uniformed military, increased 1.8 or 6,400 jobs between August of 2023 and August of 2024. 
 According to the DOL, the Construction sector had the largest growth in new jobs through August compared to the prior year. The Construction sector added 2,600 positions for a year over year growth rate of 12.9 between August of 2023 and 2024. The larger Health Care sector grew by 2,000 jobs for an annual growth rate of 4.9 over the same period. The Oil Gas sector increased by 6.5 or 500 new direct jobs. Professional and Business Services added 1,000 jobs year over year through August of 2024, up 3.4 . The Government sector grew by 700 jobs for 0.9 growth, adding 500 Federal jobs and 200 Local government positions in Alaska. The only sectors to decline between August 2023 and August 2024 were Manufacturing (primarily seafood processing) shrinking 1,300 positions and Information, down 200 jobs. 
 
 Alaska s Gross State Product GSP in the second quarter of 2024, was estimated to be 69.8 billion in current dollars, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis ("BEA"). Alaska s inflation adjusted real GSP increased 6.5 in 2023, placing Alaska fifth best of all 50 states. However, in the second quarter of 2024 Alaska decreased at an annualized rate of 1.1 , compared to the average U.S. growth rate of 3 . Alaska s real GSP decline in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily caused by a slowdown in the Mining, Oil Gas; and Transportation and Warehousing sectors. 
 
 The BEA also calculated Alaska s seasonally adjusted personal income at 55.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024. This was an annualized improvement of 4 for Alaska, compared to the national average of 5.3 . 
 
 The monthly average price of Alaska North Slope ANS crude oil was at an annual high of 89.05 in April of 2024 and averaged 74.06 in September of this year. The Alaska Department of Revenue DOR calculated ANS crude oil production was 479 thousand barrels per day bpd in Alaska s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 and declined to 461 thousand bpd in Alaska s fiscal year 2024. Starting in fiscal year 2025 it is projected to grow to 477 thousand bpd. The DOR projects the number to grow rapidly and reach 640 thousand bpd by fiscal year 2033. This is primarily a result of new production coming on-line in and around the NPR-A region west of Prudhoe Bay. 
 
 According to the Alaska Multiple Listing Services, the average sales price of a single family home in Anchorage rose 5.2 in 2023 to 480,207, following a 7.6 increase in 2022. This was the sixth consecutive year of price increases. In the first nine months of 2024 the average price continues to increase 6.8 to an average sale of 512,815. 
 
 The average sales price for single family homes in the Matanuska Susitna Borough rose 4 in 2023 to 397,589, after increasing 9.9 in 2022. This continues a trend of average price increases for more than a decade in the region. In the first nine months of 2024 the average sales price increased 4.6 to 415,709 in the Matanuska Susitna Borough. These two markets represent where the vast majority of the residential lending activity of Northrim Bank (the Bank occurs. 
 
 The Alaska Multiple Listing Services reported a 1.2 decrease in the number of units sold in Anchorage when comparing January to September of 2023 and 2024. There were 5.4 less homes sold in the Matanuska Susitna Borough for the same nine month time period in 2024 compared to the prior year. 
 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System lowered its benchmark interest rate target to 4.75 -5.00 as of September 30, 2024 from 5.25 -5.50 as of December 31, 2023. The prime rate of interest has dropped to 8.00 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 8.50 as of December 31, 2023. 

Highlights and Summary of Performance - Third Quarter of 2024 
 
 The Company reported net income and earnings per diluted share of 8.8 million and 1.57, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income and earnings per diluted share of 8.4 million and 1.48, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. The Company reported net income and earnings per diluted share of 26.0 million and 4.67, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net income and earnings per diluted share of 18.8 million and 3.30, respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in net income for both the three and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods last year is primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking income and higher net interest income, which was only partially offset by an increase in salaries and other personnel expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses. 
 41 

Net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 increased 9 to 28.8 million compared to 26.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income in the first nine months of 2024 increased 8 to 82.3 million compared to 76.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net interest margin was 4.29 for the third quarter of 2024, a 14 basis point increase from the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin was 4.23 for the first nine months of 2024, a 6 basis point increase from the first nine months of 2023. The increase in net interest margin in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due higher yields on earning assets, a favorable change in the mix of earning-assets, and an increase in total earning assets which were only partially offset by higher interest costs. 
 The weighted average interest rate for new loans booked in the third quarter of 2024 was 7.24 compared to 7.44 in the third quarter a year ago. 
 Loans were 2.01 billion at September 30, 2024, up 12 from December 31, 2023 as a result of growth in nearly all loan segments. 
 Total deposits were 2.63 billion at September 30, 2024, up 6 from December 31, 2023. Demand deposits increased 2 at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 and represent 29 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. 
 The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the quarter was 2.24 at September 30, 2024, up from 1.75 at September 30, 2023. 
 Total liquid assets and investments and loans maturing within one year were 1.07 billion and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were 641.7 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Mortgage loan originations increased to 248.05 million in the third quarter of 2024, up from 153.45 million in the third quarter a year ago. Mortgage loans funded for sale were 209.96 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 131.86 million in the third quarter of 2023.

 Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets, net of government guarantees were 5.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 5.8 million at December 31, 2023. Other Real Estate Owned OREO ), net of government guarantees was zero at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Repossessed assets increased to 297,000 as of September 30, 2024 from zero at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees decreased 41,000 or 1 to 5.0 million as of September 30, 2024 from 5.0 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to payoffs and pay downs which were only partially offset by the addition of two loans in the first nine months of 2024. Approximately 3.0 million, or 61 of nonperforming assets, net of government guarantees at September 30, 2024, are nonaccrual loans related to three commercial relationships. 
 Potential problem assets: Potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms but that have developed negative indications that the borrower may not be able to comply with present payment terms and which may later be included in nonaccrual, past due, or impaired loans. These loans are closely monitored and their performance is reviewed by management on a regular basis. At September 30, 2024, management had identified 1.5 million potential problem loans, down slightly from 1.9 million at December 31, 2023. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Income Statement 
 Net Income 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 451,000 to 8.8 million as compared to 8.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same quarter a year ago is largely attributable to a 2.6 million increase in mortgage banking income and a 2.5 million increase in net interest income. These changes were only partially offset by a 873,000 increase in the provision for credit losses, a 1.9 million increase in salaries and other personnel expense, as well as a 786,000 increase in OREO expense due to a gain on sale recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for proceeds received related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022. 
 42 

Net income for the first nine months of 2024 increased 7.3 million to 26.0 million as compared to 18.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period a year ago is largely attributable to a 6.6 million increase in mortgage banking income, a 5.8 million increase in net interest income, and a 865,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses which were only partially offset by and a 3.3 million increase in salaries and other personnel expense, as well as a 557,000 increase in data processing expense. 
 Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 9 or 2.5 million, to 28.8 million as compared to 26.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 4.29 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 4.15 in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased 8 or 5.8 million, to 82.3 million as compared to 76.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. The net interest margin increased 6 basis points to 4.23 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 4.17 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 The increase in net interest income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily the result of increased interest on loans which was only partially offset by a decrease in interest income on investments and interest bearing deposits in other banks, as well as an increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits. 
 The increase in net interest margin in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods of 2023 was primarily due to higher yields on earning assets, a favorable change in the mix of earning-assets, and an increase in total earning assets which were only partially offset by higher interest costs.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit loss expense is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the Allowance for Credit Losses ACL at an appropriate level under the Company's Current Expected Credit Losses CECL model. The determination of the amount of the ACL is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. The following table presents the major categories of credit loss expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2024: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In Thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Credit loss expense on loans held for investment 1,738 750 2,093 2,519 Credit loss expense on unfunded commitments 325 440 (1) 438 Credit loss expense on available for sale debt securities Credit loss expense on held to maturity securities Credit loss expense on purchased receivables Total credit loss expense 2,063 1,190 2,092 2,957 
 The increase in the provision for credit losses for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 is primarily the result of a higher loan growth. The provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments decreased in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to lower growth in unfunded commitment balances as well as changes in mix of the portfolio. Fluctuations in the provision for credit losses in the future will be dependent upon changes in economic conditions and forecasts, as well as loan portfolio composition, quality, and duration. 
 Other Operating Income 
 Other operating income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.6 million, or 45 , to 11.6 million as compared to 8.0 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 2.6 million increase in mortgage banking income in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter a year ago as well as a 564,000 increase in the fair value of marketable equity securities. Service charges on deposit accounts and bankcard fees also increased in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in mortgage banking income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increased production volume due to increased home purchase activity. 
 
 Other operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased 9.1 million, or 46 , to 29.0 million as compared to 19.9 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 6.6 million increase in mortgage banking income as well as a 1.3 million increase in the fair value of marketable equity securities and a 445,000 increase in purchased receivable income. Bankcard fees, purchased receivable income, and service charges on deposit accounts also increased in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in mortgage banking income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increased production volume due to rebounding home purchase activity. 

Other Operating Expense 
 Other operating expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 3.8 million, or 17 , to 26.7 million as compared to 22.9 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in salaries and other personnel expense as well as a 786,000 increase in OREO expense due to subsequent proceeds received in the third quarter of 2023 that are related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022. The increase in salaries and other personnel expense was primarily due to 1.0 million higher mortgage commissions expense due to higher production in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as well as 1.2 million higher profit sharing expense, which generally increases when net income increases to reflect a higher expected payout to employees. 
 48 

Other operating expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.4 million, or 8 , to 75.6 million as compared to 70.2 million for the same period in 2023 is primarily due to a 3.3 million increase in salaries and other personnel expense primarily due to 1.2 million higher mortgage commissions expense due to higher production and 2.0 million higher profit sharing expense as well as a 557,000 increase in data processing expense, and a 379,000 increase in OREO expense due to subsequent proceeds received in the first quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023 that are related to a government guarantee on an OREO property sold in December 2022. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, Northrim recorded a higher effective tax rate as compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of a decrease in tax credits and tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, Northrim recorded 2.8 million in state and federal income tax expense, for an effective tax rate of 24.17 compared to 1.9 million and 18.43 for the same period in 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, Northrim recorded 7.7 million in state and federal income tax expense, for an effective tax rate of 22.71 compared to 4.5 million and 19.29 for the same period in 2023.

The ACL for loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 increased 2.3 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher non-government guaranteed loan balances and changes in management's CECL model assumptions. While management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the ACL, unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in adjustment to the ACL, and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination of the ACL. 
 Deposits

Total deposits increased 140.5 million, or 6 , to 2.63 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2.49 billion as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to seasonality.

At September 30, 2024, 394.7 million, or 91 , of the Company s certificates of deposits are scheduled to mature over the next 12 months as compared to 268.5 million, or 81 , of total certificates of deposit at December 31, 2023. The aggregate amount of certificates of deposit in amounts of 250,000 and greater at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was 216.0 million and 142.1 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the amount outstanding of deposits in amounts of 250,000 and greater by time remaining until maturity and percentage of total deposits as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 Time Certificates of Deposit of 250,000 or More Percent of Total Deposits (In Thousands) Amount Amounts maturing in: Three months or less 123,555 57 Over 3 through 6 months 21,670 10 Over 6 through 12 months 41,034 19 Over 12 months 29,773 14 Total 216,032 100 
 
 At September 30, 2024, 73 of total deposits were held in business accounts and 27 of deposit balances were held in consumer accounts. Northrim had approximately 34,000 deposit customers with an average balance of 48,000 as of September 30, 2024. Northrim had 22 customers with balances over 10 million as of September 30, 2024 which accounted for 978.4 million, or 38 , of total deposits. 
 
 Uninsured deposits totaled approximately 1.12 billion or 43 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 billion or 41 of total deposits as of December 31, 2023. Since interest rates began increasing in 2023, Northrim has taken a proactive, targeted approach to increase deposit rates. There was no unusual deposit activity during the first nine months of 2024.

Borrowings 
 FHLB: The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the FHLB ). As a member, the Bank is eligible to obtain advances from the FHLB. FHLB advances are dependent on the availability of acceptable collateral such as marketable securities or real estate loans, although all FHLB advances are secured by a blanket pledge of the Bank s assets. At September 30, 2024, our maximum borrowing line from the FHLB was approximately 45 of the Bank s assets, subject to the FHLB s collateral requirements. Based on the Company's current collateral pledged to the FHLB, less outstanding advances, the Company's borrowing line is 343.8 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has outstanding advances of 13.4 million as of September 30, 2024 which were originated to match fund low income housing projects that qualify for long term fixed interest rates. These advances have original terms of either 18 or 20 years with 30 year amortization periods and fixed interest rates ranging from 1.23 to 3.25 . 
 
 Federal Reserve Bank: The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the Federal Reserve Bank is holding 70.0 million of securities as collateral to secure the Company's ability to take advances through the discount window on September 30, 2024. There were no discount window advances outstanding at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 Other Short-term Borrowings: The Company is subject to provisions under Alaska state law, which generally limit the amount of outstanding debt to 35 of total assets or 1.03 billion at September 30, 2024 and 975.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no short-term (original maturity of one year or less) borrowings that exceeded 30 of shareholders equity. 
 Long-term Borrowings. The Company had no long-term borrowing outstanding other than the FHLB advances noted above as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the Bank. Such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the Bank. Banking regulations and regulatory authorities may limit the amount of, or require the Bank to obtain certain approvals before paying, dividends to the Company. Given that the Bank currently meets and the Bank anticipates that it will continue to meet, all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized institution by regulatory standards, the Company expects to continue to receive dividends from the Bank during the remainder of 2024. Other available sources of liquidity for the bank holding company include the issuance of debt and the issuance of common or preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 10.0 million authorized shares of common stock, of which approximately 5.5 million are issued and outstanding, leaving approximately 4.5 million shares available for issuance. Additionally, the Company has 2.5 million authorized shares of preferred stock available for issuance. 
 The Bank manages its liquidity through its Asset and Liability Committee. The Bank's primary source of funds are customer deposits. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, maturity of investment securities, borrowed funds, and retained earnings are used to make loans, to acquire securities and other assets, and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations. The primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments. 
 55 

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 102.9 million, or 3 of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 118.5 million, or 4 of total assets as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents since the end of 2023 is primarily due to an increase in loans. The Company had other comprehensive income, net of tax, of 7.2 million for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024 primarily due to unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities. Accumulated unrealized losses, net of income taxes on available for sale securities, which are recorded in total shareholders' equity, are 7.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Accumulated unrealized losses, net of income taxes on held to maturity securities, which are not recorded in shareholders' equity, are 1.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Management does not believe that liquidation of these securities, which would result in realized losses, will occur prior to maturity of these securities. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average maturity of available for sale securities is 2.3 years, compared to 2.8 years at December 31, 2023, and 3.3 years at December 31, 2022. At September 30, 2024, 178.1 million available for sale securities mature within one year, 177.8 million mature within one to two years, and 112.0 million mature within two to three years. Our total unfunded commitments to fund loans and letters of credit at September 30, 2024 were 482.5 million. We do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit totaling 394.7 million are scheduled to mature over the next 12 months and may be withdrawn from the Bank. Similar to loans, we do not expect that these maturing certificates of deposit, or other non-maturity deposits, to be withdrawn from the Bank in a manner that will strain liquidity; however, unforeseen future circumstances or events may cause higher than anticipated withdrawal of deposits or draws of unfunded commitments to fund new loans. Management believes that cash requirements to fund future non-deposit and non-borrowing liabilities, including operating lease liabilities and other liabilities, as of September 30, 2024, are not material to the Company's liquidity position as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company has other available sources of liquidity to fund unforeseen liquidity requirements. These include borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, our liquid assets, which include investments and loans maturing within a year, were 1.07 billion. Our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit based on loans currently pledged and investments available to be pledged as collateral were 641.7 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient for the foreseeable future. 
 As shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Part I - Item 1 Financial Statements of this report, net cash used by operating activities was 44.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to cash used in connection with the origination of loans held for sale, which was only partially offset by cash provided by net income and net proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale. Net cash used by investing activities was 100.7 million for the same period, primarily due to an increase in loans which was only partially offset by maturities and calls of available for sale securities. Net cash provided by financing activities in the same period was 129.3 million, primarily due to an increase in deposits which was only partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders. 
 Throughout our history, the Company has periodically repurchased for cash a portion of its shares of common stock in the open market. The Company repurchased 15,034 shares of its common stock under the Company's previously announced repurchase programs in the first quarter of 2024 and did not repurchase any shares in the second or third quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, there are 110,000 shares remaining under the repurchase program. The Company may elect to continue to repurchase our common stock from time-to-time depending upon market conditions, but we can make no assurances that we will continue this program or that we will authorize additional shares for repurchase. 
 Capital Requirements and Ratios 
 We are subject to minimum capital requirements. Federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. The requirements address both risk-based capital and leverage capital. We believe as of September 30, 2024, that the Company and the Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized institution by regulatory standards. 
 
 The table below illustrates the capital requirements in effect for the periods noted for the Company and the Bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements. Management intends to maintain capital ratios for the Bank in 2024, exceeding the FDIC s requirements for the well-capitalized classification. The capital ratios for the Company exceed those for the Bank primarily because the 10 million trust preferred securities offering completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 is included in the Company s capital for regulatory purposes, although they are accounted for as a long-term debt in our financial statements. The trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the Bank s financial statements nor are they included in its capital. As a result, the Company has 10 million more in regulatory capital than the Bank at September 30, 2024, which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities. 
 
 56 

Minimum Required Capital Well-Capitalized Actual Ratio Company Actual Ratio Bank September 30, 2024 Total risk-based capital 8.00 10.00 12.50 11.15 Tier 1 risk-based capital 6.00 8.00 11.53 10.18 Common equity tier 1 capital 4.50 6.50 11.10 10.18 Leverage ratio 4.00 5.00 9.08 8.01 
 
 See Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed discussion of the capital ratios. The requirements for well-capitalized come from the Prompt Corrective Action rules. See Part I. Item 1 - Business - Supervision and Regulation in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These rules apply to the Bank but not to the Company. Under the rules of the Federal Reserve Bank, a bank holding company such as the Company is generally defined to be well capitalized if its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 8.0 or more and its total risk-based capital ratio is 10.0 or more. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our critical accounting policies are described in detail in Part II. Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis, and in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments as a result of the need to make critical accounting estimates , which are estimates that involve estimation uncertainty that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The Company's critical accounting policies include allowance for credit losses, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. There have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or assumptions within the models, that affect our estimates during 2024 except as noted below. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Policy : For loan pools that utilize the discounted cash flow ("DCF") method, the Company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts to calculate two predictive metrics, the probability of default ("PD") and loss given default ("LGD"). The PD measures the probability that a loan will default within a given time horizon and is an assumption derived from regression models which determine the relationship between historical defaults and certain economic variables. As of December 31, 2023, management used a DCF method for eight of its 11 loan pools, which represented 96 of the amortized cost basis of total loan pools at December 31, 2023. The weighted average remaining life method was used for the remaining three loan pools primarily because loan level data constraints preclude the use of the DCF model. As of December 31, 2023, management utilized and forecasted U.S. unemployment as the sole loss driver for all of the loan pools that utilize the DCF method. The Company's regression models for PD as of these time periods utilize peer historical loan level default data. Peers for this purpose include banks in the United States with total assets between 1 billion and 5 billion whose loan portfolios share certain characteristics with the Company's loan portfolio. Peers differ by loan segment; a bank is included in the peer group for each loan segment under the following circumstances: 
 The percentage the balance of the loan segment compared to total loans over a five year look back period is within 1.5 standard deviations of the Company's data; 
 The percentage of total charge offs for the loan segment over a five year look back period is within 1 standard deviation of the Company's data; and 
 The percentage of total charge offs for the loan segment during the recessionary period from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2012 is within 1 standard deviation of the Company's data. 
 
 As of January 1, 2024, management uses a DCF method for seven of its 11 loan pools, which represented 96 of the amortized cost basis of total loan pools at September 30, 2024. The weighted average remaining life method was used for the remaining four loan pools; management changed the consumer pool to the remaining life method primarily because the regression model under the DCF model for this pool fell outside of acceptable levels for certain statistical tests performed by management to determine the appropriateness of model method selections. 
 57 

Additionally, as of January 1, 2024, management utilizes and forecasts both U.S. unemployment and U.S. Gross Domestic Product in a multi-loss driver model for all of the loan pools that utilize the DCF method. The Company's regression models for PD as of January 1, 2024 utilize peer historical loan level default data. Peers for this purpose include banks in the United States with total assets between 1 billion and 5 billion whose loan portfolios share certain characteristics with the Company's loan portfolio. Peers differ by loan segment; a bank is included in the peer group for each loan segment under the following circumstances: 
 The percentage the balance of the loan segment compared to total loans over a five year look back period is within 0.5 standard deviations of the Company's data, and 
 The percentage of total charge offs for the loan segment over a five year look back period is within 0.25 standard deviation of the Company's data; and 
 The percentage of total charge offs for the loan segment during the recessionary period from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2012 is within 0.25 standard deviation of the Company's data. 
 
 There were no other changes to estimates and assumptions used in the Company's ACL since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Management performs a hypothetical sensitivity analysis of our ACL quarterly to understand the impact of a change in a key input on our ACL. As of September 30, 2024, if the four-quarter U.S. unemployment rate forecast had been approximately 8 higher and the four-quarter annualized growth rate in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product had been approximately 41 lower, our ACL for loans would have increased 1.1 million, or 6 . As of September 30, 2024, if the four-quarter national unemployment rate forecast had been approximately 32 higher and the four-quarter annualized growth rate in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product had been approximately 10 higher, which represents management's estimate of long-term mean rates for these economic factors, our ACL for loans would have increased 2.3 million, or 12 . This sensitivity analysis includes the impact to both the quantitative and qualitative components of our ACL. Changes in quantitative inputs and qualitative loss factors may not occur in the same direction or magnitude across all segments of our loan portfolio and deterioration in some quantitative inputs and qualitative loss factors may offset improvement in others. This sensitivity analysis does not represent a change to our expectations of the economic environment but provides a hypothetical result to assess the sensitivity of the ACL to a change in a key input. This sensitivity analysis does not incorporate changes to management s judgment of qualitative loss factors. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our assessment of market risk as of September 30, 2024 indicates that there are no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our principal executive and financial officers supervised and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers each concluded that as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in the periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any of our plans, products, services or procedures will succeed in achieving their intended goals under future conditions. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Disclosure and Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
