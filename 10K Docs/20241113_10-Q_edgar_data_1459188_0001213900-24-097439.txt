OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and
other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Consequently, you should read the
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with such financial statements and other
financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis
are set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report
on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in
or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

Statements in this section and elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forward-looking statements. 

All information in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relating to shares or price per share reflects the 1-for-150 reverse stock split effected by us on
August 28, 2023, with the shares beginning trading on a post-split basis on the OTC Market on April 23, 2024. 

OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONS 

Recent Developments 

Our current product,
which we are pilot testing with an Automated Parking System APS supplier in Israel, is a system that wirelessly charges
electric vehicles EVs in APSs. Upon arrival at the APS, the driver parks the EV on a plate used by the APS to transport
the EV to the final parking location. The EV remains on the plate until it is retrieved by the APS and the driver enters the EV departs.
When a driver parks an EV on these charging plates, they connect a regular charging cable to a socket installed on the plate, at which
point the plate moves through the APS via conveyors and elevators to the parking location. Our system is installed in two parts. The electricity
receiving component is installed on the plate and consists of a receiving coil and supporting electronics and a socket where the driver
connects a cable to the charging socket of the EV. The system s transmitting component is installed in the APS facility and consists
of a transmitting coil and the supporting electronics. As the driver parks the EV and connects the cable from the plate to the EV, he
initiates that charging using our mobile application. Once initiated, the system goes into standby mode. Upon the plate arriving at its
final parking location, charging of the EV begins. When the plate and EV are in the final parking position, the transmitting coil and
the receiving coil are in proximity and by way of electromagnetic induction, electricity passes from the stationary part (transmitting)
of the system to the moving (receiving) part of the system. This enables the charging of EVs in places where drivers can not enter and
manually connect a plug. 

Although we have decided
to currently focus on the solution for APSs, longer term future products will include the robotic solutions on which the Company was founded.
We have succeeded in developing a tethered robotic solution. This robot was intended to charge an EV of a disabled driver and offer an
automatic method for wireless charging of EVs. This solution will offer a big benefit for disabled drivers who have difficulty using a
regular plug-and-cable-based charger. For these drivers, it is merely impossible to exit the EV, go to the charger, take the cable and
connect the plug to the EV. Using our solution, charging will be performed automatically using the tethered robot. As the driver parks
the EV, that robot will recognize the EV and will automatically navigate under the EV and charge it wirelessly. For this we have developed
a patent-pending technology to navigate to the EV using data obtained by lidar (laser-based) sensors viewing only the EV s wheels. 

The Company concluded
a pilot testing project of its product with an Israeli company that installs and operates APSs. This pilot project was partially funded
by the Israeli Innovation Authority. Based on this pilot test, the Company has begun developing its next generation product with new features
and fixes that will make it more suitable for mass production and sales. This next generation of the Company s product is expected
to be ready for commercialization in January 2025. The Company s expected timeframe to receive regulatory approval for this product
from the Israel Standardization Institute has been slightly delayed, with the new expected timing for approval to occur by April 2025. 

14 

The purchase order received from an APS provider
in Israel for installation of multiple systems in June 2025 was delayed and the systems are now expected to be installed towards the end
of 2025. We are also in discussions with three other APS providers in Israel. The combined forecast from these customers and potential
customers is installation of approximately thirty systems by the end of 2024. We see this growth as indicative of a favorable response
from the market to our systems. 

In order to prepare to meet this increased market
demand, we are in the process of establishing subcontractor-based production capabilities, working on increasing our work force and sourcing
office and R D spaces. We have located an office and production space and plan to move our activities to this location by December
31, 2024. 

On April 23, 2024, the Company received notice
from FINRA that the Name Change and the Reverse Stock Split was announced on FINRA s daily list and would take effect at market
open on the Market Effective Date. Accordingly, the FINRA corporate action to effect the Name Change and the Reverse Stock Split is now
completed. Consequently, all share numbers, share prices, and exercise prices have been retroactively adjusted in this management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. 

Hamas-Israel War 

In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s
southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive
rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas
within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli
civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign
against Hamas and other terrorist organizations in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, since the commencement
of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with the Hezbollah terror organization based
in Lebanon, and more recently, to the south of Israel, with the Houthi terror organization in Yemen. The hostilities with Hezbollah have
escalated recently, prompting Israel to send its ground forces into southern Lebanon to destroy terrorist positions and infrastructure
used by Hezbollah for attacks on northern and central Israel, which had caused the displacement of residents in northern Israel since
early in the war. There is a risk that other terrorist organizations, including Palestinian military organizations in the West Bank
as well as other hostile countries will join the hostilities against Israel. In addition, Iran has entered the conflict against Israel,
shooting ballistic missiles at Israel twice during the current war (on April 13, 2024 and October 1, 2024). Iran is furthermore widely
believed to be developing nuclear weapons, with which it has threatened Israel. Such clashes may escalate into a greater regional conflict. 

Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

We have generated revenues of 0 and 0 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, were 546 thousand compared with 504 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses
in 2024 is due to an increase in general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, were 226 thousand, compared to 294 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses
increased by 110 thousand, from 210 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 320 thousand for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase is due to increased business and other operational activity in the Company, including the completion
of our first pilot project with Parkomot.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Going Concern 

We have not attained profitable operations and
are dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment
of profitable operations from our future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern. 

Our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and
repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. 

The Company, as of September 30, 2024, had 6
thousand in cash and has not generated any revenues from operations to date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September
30, 2023, our operating expenses amounted to 546 thousand and 504 thousand, respectively. In the previous two fiscal years our operating
expenses were 740 thousand and 753 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The Company continues to rely on borrowings and
financings. In the next 12 months we expect to incur expenses equal to approximately 1 million to advance Charging Robotics product
and expenses related to legal, accounting, audit and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the Company s status
as a U.S. reporting company. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is
currently devoting its efforts to raise further funds. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable
operations. There is no assurance that we will in fact have access to additional capital or financing as a public company. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to
investors. 

Default on Notes 

There are currently no notes in default. 

Other Contractual Obligations 

As of the year ended December 31, 2023 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have any contractual obligations, other than those already disclosed in our most recent
annual report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company (as defined in
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company s limited
resources and lack of employees, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024 and as of the date of this filing, November 13, 2024. 

Management has identified control deficiencies
regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment.
Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s accounting staff. The
small size of the Company s accounting outsourced staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such
remediation. 

To mitigate the current limited resources and
limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting
professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties
within the internal control framework. 

These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement
of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures
in order to conclude that our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 included in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our consolidated
financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No changes in the Company s internal control
over financial reporting have come to management s attention during the Company s last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
