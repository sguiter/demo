Operations at this second facility commenced in January 2021. We offered a broad array of COVID-19 related clinical diagnostic and testing services including polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19 and Influenza A and B through ProPhase Diagnostics, as well as rapid antigen and antibody/immunity testing for COVID-19. Due to the significant decrease in demand and reimbursement rate for our diagnostic testing service, we do not currently provide diagnostic testing services. Nonetheless we are prepared to provide an increased volume of our diagnostic testing service if diagnostic testing is required due to a new COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, in order to maintain licenses in certain states in which we operate, we currently perform several diagnostic tests each quarter to maintain our certified lab status, and we currently plan to do so for the foreseeable future.

The BE-Smart test is focused on the early detection of esophageal cancer, and is intended to provide health care providers and patients with data to help determine treatment options.

 General 
 We are a diversified company that offers a range of services including genomics testing, diagnostic testing and contract manufacturing. We are also focused on licensing, developing and commercializing novel drugs, dietary supplements, compounds and diagnostics. 
 We conduct our operations through two operating segments: diagnostic services and consumer products. 
 Until late fiscal year 2020, we were engaged primarily in the research, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of over-the-counter ("OTC") consumer healthcare products and dietary supplements in the United States. This includes the development and marketing of dietary supplements under the TK Supplements brand. However, commencing in December 2020, we also began offering COVID- 19 and were prepared to validate other RPP Molecular tests through our diagnostic service business. In August 2021, we began offering personal genomics products and services and in July 2022 we began focusing on the licensing, development and commercialization of novel drugs, dietary supplements, compounds and diagnostics. 
 Our wholly owned subsidiary, ProPhase Diagnostics, Inc. ProPhase Diagnostics ), which was formed on October 9, 2020, offers a broad array of clinical diagnostic and testing services at its CLIA certified laboratories including polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19. Critical to COVID-19 testing, we provide fast turnaround times for results. We also offer best-in-class rapid antigen testing for COVID-19. On October 23, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Confucius Plaza Medical Laboratory Corp., which owned a 4,000 square foot CLIA accredited laboratory located in Old Bridge, New Jersey for approximately 2.5 million. In December 2020, we expanded our diagnostic service business with the build-out of a second, larger CLIA accredited laboratory in Garden City, New York. Operations at this second facility commenced in January 2021. Due to the significant decrease in demand and reimbursement rate for our diagnostic testing service, we do not currently provide diagnostic testing services. Nonetheless we are prepared to provide an increased volume of our diagnostic testing service if diagnostic testing is required due to a new COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, in order to maintain licenses in certain states in which we operate, we currently perform several diagnostic tests each quarter to maintain our certified lab status, and we currently plan to do so for the foreseeable future. 
 On August 10, 2021, we acquired Nebula Genomics, Inc., a privately owned personal genomics company, through our new wholly owned subsidiary, ProPhase Precision Medicine Inc. ProPhase Precision ). Subsequently in 2022, ProPhase Precision legal name was changed to Nebula Genomics, Inc. ("Nebula"). Nebula focuses on genomics sequencing technologies, a comprehensive method for analyzing entire genomes, including the genes and chromosomes in DNA. The data obtained from genomic sequencing can be used to help identify inherited disorders and tendencies, help predict disease risk, help identify expected drug response, and characterize genetic mutations, including those that drive cancer progression. 
 Our wholly owned subsidiary, ProPhase BioPharma, Inc. PBIO was formed on June 28, 2022, for the licensing, development and commercialization of novel drugs, dietary supplements and compounds, beginning with Equivir and Equivir G. PBIO announced a second licensing agreement for two small molecule proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus kinase inhibitors, Linebacker LB-1 and LB-2, in July 2022, with plans to pursue development and commercialization of LB-1 as a cancer co-therapy. 
 In January 2023, we acquired exclusive rights to the BE-Smart Esophageal Pre-Cancer Diagnostic Screening Test and related intellectual property assets.

 Our consumer sales are and will continue to be impacted by (i) the timing of acceptance of our TK Supplements consumer products in the marketplace, and (ii) fluctuations in the timing of purchase and the ultimate level of demand for the OTC healthcare and cold remedy products that we manufacture, which is largely a function of the timing, length and severity of each cold season. Generally, a cold season is defined as the period from September to March when the incidence of the common cold rises as a result of the change in weather and other factors. We generally experience in the first, third and fourth quarter higher levels of net revenues from our contract manufacturing business. Revenues are generally at their lowest levels in the second quarter when customer demand generally declines. 
 In addition, we continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities for other companies, technologies and products within and outside the consumer products industry. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue was 3.1 million as compared to 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net revenue was the result of a 2.5 million decrease in net revenue from diagnostic services, and a 2.7 million decrease in consumer products. The decrease in net revenue for diagnostic services was due to decreased COVID-19 testing volumes compared to the 2023 period. Overall diagnostic testing volume decreased from 13,000 tests in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to zero tests in the three months ended September 30, 2024. None of the tests during the three months ended September 30, 2023 were reimbursed by the HRSA uninsured program. 
 Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.3 million, comprised of 0.5 million for diagnostic services and 2.8 million for consumer products. Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 6.0 million, comprised of 1.8 million for diagnostic services and 4.2 million for consumer products. 
 We realized a gross margin loss o f 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gross margin profit of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2.5 million was comprised of a decrease of 1.2 million in diagnostic services, and a decrease of 1.3 million in consumer products. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we realized an overall gross margin of (5.2) and 27.8 , respectively. Gross margin for diagnostic services was zero or not applicable due to no revenue and 27.8 in the 2024 and 2023 comparable periods, respectively. Gross margin for consumer products was 10.7 and 27.8 in the 2024 and 2023 comparable periods, respectively. Gross margin for consumer products have historically been influenced by fluctuations in quarter-to-quarter production volume, fixed production costs and related overhead absorption, raw ingredient costs, inventory mark to market write-downs and timing of shipments to customers. 
 Diagnostic services costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were zero compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in diagnostic service costs o f 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to decreased COVID-19 testing volumes in 2024 compared to the 2023 period.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation 
 In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures. The primary non-GAAP financial measures we disclose are EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We define "EBITDA" as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by excluding acquisition costs, other non-cash items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges (as described in the table below). 
 Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. 
 We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate and manage the Company s operations because we believe they provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company s ongoing economic performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that are not considered part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze our historical results and in providing estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures could result in confusion among analysts and others and create a misplaced perception that our results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.

 The following table sets forth the reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA excluding other costs to the most comparable GAAP financial measures (in thousands): 
 For the three months ended For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 GAAP net income (1) 
 (6,587) (5,141) (19,005) (5,141) Interest, net 1,158 274 2,316 274 Income tax benefit (2,508) (1,644) (7,361) (1,644) Depreciation and amortization 2,390 3,143 5,693 3,143 EBITDA (5,547) (3,368) (18,357) (3,368) Share-based compensation expense 636 744 3,021 744 Non-cash rent expense (2) 
 471 99 236 99 Credit loss expense Adjusted EBITDA (4,440) (2,525) (15,100) (2,525) 
 (1) We believe that net income (loss) is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that is most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measure the Company s operating performance without regard to certain expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and the Company s computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in the industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP. 
 (2) The non-cash portion of rent, which reflects the extent to which our GAAP rent expense recognized exceeds (or is less than) our cash rent payments. For newer leases, our rent expense recognized typically exceeds our cash rent payments, while for more mature leases, rent expense recognized is typically less than our cash rent payments. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our aggregate cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were 1.1 million as compared to 2.1 million at December 31, 2023. Our working capital was 13.5 million and 26.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 1.1 million in our cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to 14.0 million cash used in operating activities, capital expenditures of 1.1 million, and repayment of notes payable for 2.5 million, offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of 3.4 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock, notes payable and mortgage loan of 13.0 million. 
 To date the principal sources of capital to fund our operations have been from diagnostic services, genomics sequencing, product sales, net proceeds from the offering of equity securities, and issuances of promissory notes. Based on management s current business plans, the Company estimates it will have enough cash and liquidity to finance its operating requirements for at least 12 months from the date of filing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. However, due to the nature of early-stage ventures and accounts receivables collections, there are inherent uncertainties associated with managements business plan and cash flow projections, particularly if the Company is unable to grow its business lines, including replacing the revenues from our lab diagnostic services or tests with new business lines, or collect on its accounts receivables in a timely manner or at all. If we were to experience a cash shortfall, we believe our access to existing and other financing sources, including our at-the-market facility, and the established relationships with our investment banks will enable us to continue to meet our obligations and fund ongoing operations. 
 We may also use our cash to explore and/or acquire new product technologies, applications, product line extensions, new contract manufacturing applications and other new product opportunities. In the event that our available cash is insufficient to support such initiatives, we may need to incur indebtedness or issue common stock or other securities to finance our plans for growth. Volatility in the credit markets and the liquidity of major financial institutions, including as a result of inflation and/or the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip and measures taken in response thereto, may have an adverse impact on our ability to fund our business strategy through future borrowings, under either existing or newly created instruments in the public or private markets on terms that we believe to be reasonable, if at all.

We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for foreseeable future. We expect to continue to incur research and development costs and general and administrative expenses, as well as expenses related to potential commercialization of our product candidates, consistent with costs associated with research and development at companies of our size and stage of development, and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources.

 JXVII Trust Promissory Note 
 On January 26, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note and guaranty for an aggregate principal amount of 7.6 million (the "JXVII Note") to JXVII Trust JXVII ). The JXVII Note is due and payable on January 27, 2026, the third anniversary of the date on which the JXVII Note was funded (the Note Closing Date ), and accrues interest at a rate of 10 per year from the Note Closing Date, payable on a quarterly basis, until the JXVII Note is repaid in full. We have the right to prepay the JXVII Note at any time after the Note Closing Date and prior to the maturity date without premium or penalty upon providing seven days written notice to JXVII. Repayment of the JXVII Note has been guaranteed by the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, PMI. 
 The JXVII Note contains customary events of default. If a default occurs and is not cured within the applicable cure period or is not waived, any outstanding obligations under the JXVII Note may be accelerated. The JXVII Note also contains certain restrictive covenants which, among other things, restrict our ability to create, incur, assume or permit to exist, directly or indirectly, any lien (other than certain permitted liens described in the JXVII Note) securing any indebtedness of the Company, and prohibits us from distributing or reinvesting the proceeds from any divestment of assets (other than in the ordinary course) without the prior approval of JXVII. 
 On August 15, 2024, the Company and JXVII entered into an amended and restated unsecured promissory note for the JXVII Note (the Amended JXVII Note ), increasing the principal amount by 2.4 million to 10.0 million, increasing the interest rate from 10 to 15 per annum, and extending the maturity date from January 27, 2026 to August 15, 2027. The Company received 2.3 million cash and exchanged the outstanding interest of 94,000. The amendment was accounted for as a debt modification, and the remaining unamortized debt discount as of the amendment date from the JXVII Note will be amortized over the remaining term of the Amended JXVII Note. 
 Term Note Agreemen t 
 
 On October 22, 2024, we entered into a term note agreement with an individual investor for cash proceeds of 500,000 (the Term Note ). The Term Note has an implicit interest rate of 15 . The Term Note has a term of 12 months and requires us to make interest only monthly payments in the amount of 6,250 with a 506,250 balloon payment at end of term. 
 
 HRSA Funding 
 In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was enacted, providing for reimbursement to healthcare providers for COVID-19 tests provided to uninsured individuals, subject to continued available funding. There were no diagnostic services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that was generated from this program for the uninsured. On March 22, 2022, the Health Resources Services Administration's uninsured program stopped accepting claims for COVID-19 testing and treatment due to lack of sufficient funds. Despite requests from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the White House Coordinator for COVID-19 Response for additional emergency funding for the uninsured program, additional emergency funding were not allocated to the Health Resources Services Administration's uninsured program. 
 On January 30, 2023, the Administration announced that effective May 11, 2023, the federal Public Health Emergency would expire related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This expiration changes regulatory guidelines around COVID-19 testing including billing codes and reimbursement rates of in and out of network laboratories. As a result of the Public Health Emergency ending and the significant decrease in demand of COVID-19 testing, we have reduced the amount of diagnostic testing services that we provide since the second half of 2023. 
 
 At-the-Market Facility 
 On December 28, 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with ThinkEquity LLC (the Sales Agent ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through the Sales Agent, shares of our common 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 100,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement. We are not obligated to make any sales of shares under the Sales Agreement. 
 We will pay the Sales Agent a fixed commission rate of 2.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of any shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement and have agreed to provide the Sales Agent with customary indemnification and contribution rights. We also agreed to reimburse the actual out-of-pocket accountable expenses of the Sales Agent up to 60,000 (of which a 25,000 advance was paid on December 7, 2021), which amount includes the fees and expenses of legal counsel to the Sales Agent up to 50,000, and to pay the costs associated with bound volumes of the public offering materials as well as commemorative mementos and lucite tombstones, in an amount not to exceed 3,000. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 1,033,500 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. The Company received cash proceeds of 4.6 million, which is net of 94,000 offering cost incurred by the Sales Agent. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 We are subject to normal inflationary trends and anticipate that any increased costs for our contract manufacturing and retail operations would be passed on to our customers; however, any increased costs related to diagnostic services would be absorbed by the Company. Inflation could have a material effect on our business in the future. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Part II. However, certain accounting policies are deemed critical , as they require management s highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. These accounting policies, estimates and disclosures have been discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions are as follows: 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Examples include revenue recognition and the estimation of the variable consideration associated with the diagnostic reimbursement rates, the allowance for credit losses and billing discrepancies, sales returns and allowances, inventory obsolescence, useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill, intangibles and property and equipment, income tax valuations and assumptions related to accrued advertising. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments on a quarterly basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivables 
 We generate revenue principally through four types of revenue streams: diagnostic services, contract manufacturing, genomic products and services, and retail and other. The process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables involves assumptions and judgments. 
 Revenue from our diagnostic services is recognized when the lab test is complete, and the diagnostic test result is provided to the customer. Revenue from our genomics services is recognized when sequencing reports are provided to the customer. Revenue from our consumer products is recognized when the shipments to contract manufacturing and retailer customers are recognized at the time ownership is transferred to the customer. We bill the providers at standard price and take into consideration for negotiated discounts and an anticipated reimbursement remittance adjustments based on the payer portfolio, when revenue is recorded. We use the most expected value method to estimate the transaction price for reimbursements that may vary from the standard price. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 We carry our accounts receivable at cost less an allowance for credit losses. Allowances for credit losses are based upon our judgment regarding collectability. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our receivables and establish an allowance for credit losses, based on a history of past write-offs, collections, current credit conditions or generally accepted future trends in the industry and/or local economy. Accounts are written off as uncollectible at the time we determine that collections are unlikely. The reserve is not intended to address return activity or disputed balances with ongoing customers, as this should be addressed in a reserve for credit memos with a corresponding charge to revenue. 
 Goodwill and Long-lived Assets 
 We review our goodwill at least annually for impairment as well as the carrying value of goodwill and our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. When it is determined that the carrying amount of long-lived assets or goodwill is impaired, impairment is measured by comparing an asset s estimated fair value to its carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or independent appraisals; sales price negotiations; or projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with our business risk. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes significant judgments regarding assumptions of revenue, operating and marketing costs; selling and administrative expenses; interest rates; property and equipment additions and retirements; and industry competition, general economic and business conditions, among other factors. 
 Income Taxes 
 Accounting for income taxes requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These deferred taxes are measured by applying the provisions of tax laws in effect at the balance sheet date, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA enacted on December 22, 2017. The TCJA made broad and significant changes to the U.S. tax code that affects the year ended December 31, 2017, including, but not limited to, a change in the federal rate from 35 to 21 effective January 1, 2018. 
 We recognize in income the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the TCJA enactment date. We utilize the asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates. Until sufficient taxable income to offset the temporary timing differences attributable to operations and the tax deductions attributable to option, warrant and stock activities are assured, a valuation allowance equaling the total net current and non-current deferred tax asset is being provided. 
 Inventories 
 Inventory is valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis FIFO ), or net realizable value. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on current and anticipated customer demand, production and laboratory requirements. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Adopted 
 In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar Awards ("ASU 2024-01").

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Like virtually all commercial enterprises, we can be exposed to the risk market risk that the cash flows to be received or paid relating to certain financial instruments could change as a result of changes in interest rate, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. 
 Our operations are not subject to risks of material foreign currency fluctuations, nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our investment practices. We place our marketable investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We do not expect material losses with respect to our investment portfolio or excessive exposure to market risks associated with interest rates. The impact on our results of one percentage point change in short-term interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings, fair value, or cash flows related to investments in cash equivalents or interest-earning marketable securities. 
 Current economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance including the collection of accounts receivables, notes receivable, realization of inventory and recoverability of assets. In addition, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including a reduction in the availability of credit, financial market volatility and recession. 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer. Based on that review, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Material Weakness 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements could occur but will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with our 2023 Annual Report, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based upon that review, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, concluded that the Company s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2023 due to the material weaknesses described below. 
 
 We did not adequately review certain account reconciliations or controls over the financial statement closing process, which resulted in misstatements in account reconciliations and resulted in several proposed unadjusted journal entries. 
 
 Several errors were made related to recording revenue in the proper period, calculating current period revenue, and following Company policy regarding principal versus agent considerations, resulting in misstatements in accounts receivable, deferred revenue, and revenue for multiple subsidiaries. We relied heavily on the manual input process for these areas and it did not properly design and maintain controls to identify exceptions. In certain 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 instances where revenue is recorded based on an estimation of rates, process were not in place to properly update the rates accordingly throughout the year. 
 
 We did not design and maintain adequate controls over the identification of discrepancies relating to the calculated and recorded deferred costs and cost of sales, which such calculation and recording relied heavily on the manual input process and resulted in misstatements in deferred costs and cost of sales. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 
 We are in the process of continuing to evaluate the material weaknesses and developing a detailed plan for remediation of the material weakness. The Company has hired a third-party accounting consultant and has recently added personnel to aid in implementing additional levels of review and approval. We will not consider the material weakness remediated until the remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, that these controls are effectively designed and operating effectively. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with our future assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures throughout 2024. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may execute additional measures to address potential control deficiencies or modify the remediation plan described above. We will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal control. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above, no change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent quarter with respect to our operations, which materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we have been and may again become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently a party to any material litigation. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024, except as otherwise disclosed below. However, we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt. 
 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We had, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 17.2 million of outstanding indebtedness, net of discounts and approximately 0.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, on August 15, 2024, we entered into the Amended JXVII Note that increased the principal amount from 7.6 million to 10.0 million; and on October 22, 2024, we entered into the Term Note for cash proceeds of 500,000. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt obligations and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.
