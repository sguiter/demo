million to the Navajo Nation for CCT; (ii) million to the Navajo County communities for CCT and economic development; and (iii) million to the Hopi Tribe for CCT and economic development. The ACC also authorized million to be spent for electrification of homes and businesses on each of the Navajo Nation and Hopi reservations. Expenditure of the recoverable funds for electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation and the Hopi reservations is contingent upon completion of a census of the unelectrified homes and businesses in each that are also within APS service territory. The census work was completed in November 2022 and disbursement of the funds for electrification of homes and businesses is planned to be finalized after discussions with the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe are completed. On February 22, 2024, the ACC voted to not approve any further CCT funding. 
 
 APS filed a Notice of Direct Appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals on December 17, 2021 requesting review of certain aspects of the 2019 Rate Case. On March 6, 2023, the Court issued its opinion in this matter, affirming in part and reversing in part the ACC s decision in the 2019 Rate Case. The Court vacated the -basis-point penalty included in the ACC s allowed return on equity, as the Court determined the use of customer service metrics to justify the reduction exceeded the ACC s ratemaking authority. Additionally, the Court vacated the disallowance of million of APS s Four Corners SCR investment. The Court remanded the issue to the ACC for further proceedings. 
 
 On June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to allow recovery of the million in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners SCR, a reversal of the -basis point reduction to APS s return on equity from to as a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, and recovery of million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023.

See Court Resolution Surcharge below for more information. 
 
 Regulatory Lag Docket 
 
 On January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC s historical test year rules. The ACC requested comments from utilities and interested parties on ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years and hybrid test years. APS filed comments on June 1, 2023. On March 19, 2024, the ACC held a workshop to discuss modifying the state s rate case test year rules. Utilities, including APS, spoke about alternatives to the current rules that could reduce regulatory lag. On April 19, 2024, a letter was filed to the docket by an ACC commissioner discussing the potential benefits of modifying test year rules, including the potentiality of offering utilities to choose the type of test year that best suits them. The letter also recommended that this issue be discussed at the next possible open meeting. On July 9, 2024, at an open meeting, ACC Commissioners discussed objectives of future regulatory lag workshops and voted to schedule at least one more workshop on this topic later this year. The ACC held an additional workshop on October 3, 2024 to discuss formula rate methodologies and their use in ratemaking. The workshop included presentations from representatives of FERC, customer advocates, other stakeholders, and utilities, including APS. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

implementation plan with the ACC and seek approval for funding the upcoming year s RES budget. In 2015, the ACC revised the RES rules to allow the ACC to consider all available information, including the number of rooftop solar arrays in a utility s service territory, to determine compliance with the RES. 
 
 In June 2021, the ACC adopted a clean energy rules package which would require APS to meet certain clean energy standards and technology procurement mandates, obtain approval for its action plan included in its Integrated Resource Plan IRP ), and seek cost recovery in a rate process. Since the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original Recommended Order and Opinion, supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective. On January 26, 2022, the ACC reversed its prior decision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process. Instead, the ACC opened a new docket to consider ASRFP requirements and the IRP process. See Energy Modernization Plan below for more information. 
 
 On July 1, 2021, APS filed its 2022 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately million.

 On July 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately million, excluding any funding offsets. This budget contained funding for programs to comply with ACC-approved initiatives, including the 2019 Rate Case decision. APS s budget proposal supported existing approved projects and commitments and requested a waiver of the RES residential and non-residential distributed energy requirements for 2022. On November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2023 RES Implementation Plan, including APS s requested waiver of the distributed energy requirement for 2023. 
 
 On September 23, 2022, APS filed a community solar proposal in compliance with the ACC order that was informed by a stakeholder working group. APS proposed a small, pilot-scale program size of up to MW that would be selected through a competitive ASRFP. The ACC has not yet ruled on the proposal. However, on November 10, 2022, the ACC approved a bifurcated community solar process, directing ACC Staff to develop a statewide policy through additional stakeholder involvement and establishing a separate evidentiary hearing to define other policy components. On March 23, 2023, the ACC approved a policy statement that included information on how statewide community solar and storage programs should be structured, their location, and inclusion in ASRFPs. The remainder of the community solar program policy components were deferred to the ACC s Hearing Division so that a formal evidentiary hearing could be held to consider issues of substance related to community solar. On March 5, 2024, the ACC ordered APS to not expand or extend the APS Solar Communities program. Consistent with that decision, the Solar Communities

 Demand Side Management Adjustor Charge . The ACC Electric Energy Efficiency Standards require APS to submit a DSM Implementation Plan annually for review and approval by the ACC. Verified energy savings from APS s resource savings projects can be counted toward compliance with the Electric Energy Efficiency Standards; however, APS is not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of the achievement of performance incentives, nor may APS include savings from these system savings projects in the calculation of its LFCR mechanism. See below for discussion of the LFCR. 
 
 On December 17, 2021, APS filed its 2022 D SM Implementation Plan in accordance with an extension granted in 2021.

On November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 DSM Implementation Plan, including a proposed performance incentive. 
 
 On June 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 Transportation Electrification Plan 2023 TE Plan ). The 2023 TE Plan detailed APS s efforts to support transportation electrification in Arizona, including the Take Charge AZ Pilot Program and customer education and outreach related to transportation electrification. Subsequently, APS filed an amended 2023 TE Plan on November 30, 2022, that included a request for a million budget. On December 12, 2023, the ACC approved the 2023 TE Plan without including the Take Charge AZ Program and its budget going forward, but allowed APS to complete projects already underway. Additionally, the ACC discontinued the residential EV SmartCharger rebate and approved modifications to the EV rate plan. 
 
 On November 30, 2022, APS filed its 2023 DSM Implementation Plan, which requested a budget of million. On M ay 31, 2023, APS filed an amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan. The amended plan maintained the originally proposed budget of million. Subsequent to filing the amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan and prior to the ACC approving it, on November 30, 2023, APS filed its 2024 DSM Implementation Plan. The 2024 DSM Implementation Plan requested a total budget of million and incorporated all elements of the amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan as well as the 2024 TE Implementation Plan. On April 26, 2024, APS filed an amendment to the 2024 DSM Implementation Plan. The amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes an updated budget of million to reflect removal of incentive funds for the Level 2 Smart Charger rebate within the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot, an update on the performance incentive calculation, and the withdrawal of tranches two and three of the

 On November 30, 2021, APS filed its PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2022. That rate was per kWh, which consisted of a forward component of ) per kWh and a historical component of per kWh. The 2022 PSA rate was a per kWh increase compared to the 2021 PSA year, which is the maximum permitted under the Plan of Administration for the PSA. These rates went into effect as filed on February 1, 2022. 
 
 On April 1, 2022, the ACC filed a final report of its third-party audit findings regarding APS s fuel and purchased power costs for the period January 2019 through January 2021. The report contained an in-depth review of APS s fuel and purchased power contracts, its monthly fuel accounting activities, its forecasting and dispatching procedures, and its monthly PSA filings, among other fuel-related activities. The report found that APS s fuel processing accounting practices, dispatching procedures, and procedures for hedging activity were reasonable and appropriate. The report included several recommendations for the ACC s consideration,

per kWh, which consisted of a forward component of ) per kWh, a historical component of per kWh and a transition component of per kWh, that will continue until further notice of the ACC. The rate became effective with the first billing cycle in March 2023 and is designed to bring the PSA balancing account to near-zero over a -month period. On November 30, 2023, APS notified the ACC that it will be maintaining the current PSA rate of per kWh and an updated PSA adjustment schedule would not be filed at that time. In Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case, the ACC approved a permanent increase in the annual PSA adjustor rate cap from per kWh to per kWh and a requirement that APS report to the ACC for possible action when the overall PSA balance reaches million. As part of the 2022 Rate Case decision, the ACC also approved an overall PSA rate of per kWh, which consisted of a forward component of ) per kWh, a historical component of per kWh, and a transition component of per kWh. The overall PSA rate was reduced to offset an increase in base fuel prices. The rate became effective on March 8, 2024. 
 
 As a result of the 2022 Rate Case decision, the requirement to seek approval for recovery of costs related to third-party storage systems through the PSA adjustment mechanism was removed. Prior to this decision, APS was required to seek ACC approval to recover costs related to third-party energy storage systems through its PSA adjustment mechanism. In 2023, energy storage PPAs and their respective costs were approved for recovery through the PSA. In 2022, energy storage PPA and its costs was approved for recovery through the PSA. In 2021, energy storage PPAs and their respective costs were approved for recovery through the PSA. However, energy storage PPA that was approved in 2021 was later terminated by APS due to project delays. 
 
 Environmental Improvement Surcharge. On March 5, 2024, the ACC approved the elimination of the EIS, and the surcharge is no longer in effect. The EIS permitted APS to recover the capital carrying costs (rate of return, depreciation and taxes) plus incremental operations and maintenance expenses associated with environmental improvements made outside of a test year to comply with environmental standards set by federal, state, tribal, or local laws and regulations. APS s February 1, 2023 EIS application requested an increase in the charge to million, or million over the prior-period charge. On March 10, 2023, APS filed an amended application requesting an EIS charge of million, a decrease of million from the February EIS request and a decrease of million from the prior-period charge. The revised 2023 EIS became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2023; however, with the elimination of the surcharge, it is no longer in effect, and any remaining amounts are being collected through base rates. 
 
 Transmission Rates, Transmission Cost Adjustor and Other Transmission Matters . In July 2008, FERC approved a modification to APS s Open Access Transmission Tariff to allow APS to move from fixed rates to a formula rate-setting methodology in order to more accurately reflect and recover the costs that APS incurs in providing transmission services. A large portion of the rate represents charges for transmission services to serve APS s retail customers Retail Transmission Charges ). In order to recover the Retail Transmission Charges, APS was previously required to file an application with, and obtain approval from, the ACC to reflect changes in Retail Transmission Charges through the TCA. Under the terms of the settlement agreement entered into in 2012 regarding APS s rate case, however, an adjustment to rates to recover the Retail

million for the 12-month period beginning June 1, 2022, in accordance with the FERC-approved formula. Of this net amount, wholesale customer rates decreased by approximately million and retail customer rates would have decreased by approximately million. However, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement decreased by million, resulting in a reduction to the residential rate and increases to commercial rates. An adjustment to APS s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2022. 
 
 Effective June 1, 2023, APS s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system increased by approximately million for the 12-month period beginning June 1, 2023, in accordance with the FERC-approved formula. Of this net amount, wholesale customer rates increased by approximately million and retail customer rates would have increased by approximately million. However, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement decreased by million, resulting in reductions to the residential and commercial rates. An adjustment to APS s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2023. 
 
 Effective June 1, 2024, APS s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system increased by approximately million for the 12-month period beginning June 1, 2024 in accordance with the FERC-approved formula. Of this net amount, wholesale customer rates increased by approximately million and retail customer rates would have increased by approximately million. However, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement increased by million, resulting in an increase to residential and commercial rates over MW and a decrease to commercial rates less than or equal to MW. An adjustment to APS s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2024.

of retail revenues. Any amounts left unrecovered in a particular year because of this cap can be carried over for recovery in a future year. The kWhs lost from energy efficiency are based on a third-party evaluation of APS s energy efficiency programs. DG sales losses are determined from the metered output from the DG units. 
 
 As a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, the fixed costs recoverable by the LFCR mechanism were set at cents for lost residential kWh and cents for lost non-residential kWh as set forth in the 2019 Rate Case decision. APS s annual LFCR adjustor rate is dependent on an annual earnings test filing, which compares APS s previous year s rate of return with the related authorized rate of return. If the actual rate of return is higher than the authorized rate of return, the LFCR rate for the subsequent year is set at zero. As a result of certain changes made to the LFCR mechanism in the 2019 Rate Case decision, the mechanism no longer qualifies for alternative revenue program accounting treatment. 
 
 On February 15, 2022, APS filed its 2022 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that effective May 1, 2022, the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to million (a million increase from previous levels, which was inclusive of a million balance from APS s 2021 LFCR filing). On May 9, 2022, the ACC Staff filed its revised report and proposed order regarding APS s 2022 LFCR adjustment, concluding that APS calculated the adjustment in accordance with its Plan of Administration. On May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 LFCR adjustment, with a rate effective date of June 1, 2022. 
 
 On February 15, 2023, APS filed a letter to the ACC docket stating that, in accordance with Decision No. 78585, APS and ACC Staff have agreed to move the filing date for the annual LFCR adjustment to July 31 each year. On September 5, 2023, APS filed an updated LFCR Plan of Administration, which was approved by ACC Staff on December 8, 2023. On July 31, 2023, APS filed its 2023 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to million (a million increase from previous levels). On October 19, 2023, a request for intervention was filed, which was granted. Consistent with an October 25, 2023, Procedural Order, the parties met and conferred and conducted limited discovery. As a result of Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case, APS transferred million from the LFCR to base rates. 
 
 On March 8, 2024, APS filed conforming LFCR schedules to incorporate changes required as a result of Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case. On April 9, 2024, the ACC approved the 2023 annual LFCR adjustment, with new rates effective in the first billing cycle of May 2024. 
 
 On June 5, 2024, APS filed a revised LFCR Plan of Administration in accordance with Decision No. 79293. The ACC approved the revised Plan of Administration on October 8, 2024. 
 
 On July 31, 2024, APS filed its 2024 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that effective November 1, 2024, the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to million (an million increase from previous levels). The Commission has not yet ruled on this matter. 
 
 Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism . The TEAM helps address potential federal income tax reform and enable the pass-through of certain income tax effects to customers. The TEAM expressly applies to APS s retail rates with the exception of a small subset of customers taking service under specially-approved tariffs. As part of the 2019 Rate Case decision, there remains small true up balances in the TEAM balancing account. In the 2022 Rate Case, these true up balances are being recovered and amortized through 2032.

per kWh. The rate is designed to recover million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates. The portion of the CRS representing the recovery of the million of lost revenue between December 2021 and June 20, 2023, million of which has been collected as of September 30, 2024, will cease upon full collection of the lost revenue. Additionally, the CRS tariff was updated to remove the return on equity component and account for SCR-related depreciation and deferral adjustments approved in Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case. See 2019 Retail Rate Case above for more information. 
 
 Net Metering 
 
 The ACC s decision from APS s 2017 rate case (the 2017 Rate Case Decision provides that payments by utilities for energy exported to the grid from residential DG solar facilities will be determined using a Resource Comparison Proxy RCP methodology as determined in the ACC s generic Value and Cost of Distributed Generation docket. RCP is a method that is based on the most recent five-year rolling average price that APS incurs for utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. The price established by this RCP method will be updated annually (between general retail rate cases) but will not be decreased by more than per year. The ACC is no longer pursuing development of a forecasted avoided cost methodology as an option for utilities in place of the RCP. Commercial customers, grandfathered residential solar customers, and residential customers with DG systems other than solar facilities continue to qualify for net metering. 
 
 In addition, the ACC made the following determinations in the Value and Cost of Distributed Generation docket: 
 
 RCP customers who have interconnected a DG system or submitted an application for interconnection for DG systems will be grandfathered for a period of years from the date the customer s interconnection application was accepted by the utility (for APS residential customers, as of September 1, 2017, based on APS s 2017 Rate Case Decision); 
 
 customers with DG solar systems are to be considered a separate class of customers for ratemaking purposes; and 
 
 once an initial export price is set for utilities, no netting or banking of retail credits will be available for new DG customers, and the then-applicable export price will be guaranteed for new customers for a period of years. 
 
 This decision of the ACC addresses policy determinations only. The decision states that its principles will be applied in future general retail rate cases, and the policy determinations themselves may be subject to future change, as are all ACC policies. 
 
 On April 29, 2022, APS filed an application to decrease the RCP price from cents per kWh, which had been in effect since October 1, 2021, to cents per kWh, reflecting a annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2022. On July 12, 2022, the ACC approved the RCP as filed.

cents per kWh, reflecting a annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2023. On August 25, 2023, the ACC approved the RCP as filed. 
 
 On October 11, 2023, the ACC voted to open a new general docket to hold a hearing to explore potential future changes to the annual reduction cap in the solar export rate paid by utilities to distributed solar customers for exports to the grid and the rate lock period for those customers that were approved in the ACC s Value and Cost of Distributed Generation Docket. A procedural conference was held on November 1, 2023, to discuss the process going forward. As a result of the procedural conference, ACC Staff issued a request for information to investigate the issues related to this matter. A status conference was held on March 20, 2024 to determine if ACC Staff is prepared to present a recommendation on this matter at that time. Stakeholders provided responses to the ACC Staff s request for information on March 21, 2024. Another status conference took place on May 20, 2024 and ACC Staff issued a request for additional information to investigate the issues related to the matter on May 31, 2024. Stakeholders provided responses to the ACC Staff s request for additional information on July 1, 2024, and on October 15, 2024, the ACC Staff filed a report finding that the RCP is working as intended and recommending no changes to the RCP at this time. The ACC Staff also recommended that the ACC close the docket without a hearing or further action. The ACC has not yet acted on the ACC Staff s recommendation, and APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 On May 1, 2024, APS filed an application for revisions to the RCP. This application would decrease the RCP price to cents per kWh, reflecting a annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2024. On August 13, 2024, the ACC approved the RCP as filed. 
 
 Energy Modernization Plan 
 
 On May 26, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to review articles within the Arizona Administrative Code related to Resource Planning, the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, and Electric Energy Efficiency Standards. On January 9, 2024, the ACC approved a rulemaking process for this matter. During the ACC Open Meeting on February 6, 2024, the ACC approved motions to direct ACC Staff to include recommendations to repeal the current Electric Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard rules during the rulemaking process. On August 21, 2024, the ACC Staff filed separate reports for each set of rules, including its recommendations to repeal the Electric Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard rules along with required preliminary economic, small business, and consumer impact statements. APS and other interested parties have filed comments about the ACC Staff reports. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Integrated Resource Planning 
 
 ACC rules require utilities to develop triennial 15-year IRPs which describe how the utility plans to serve customer load in the plan time frame. The ACC reviews each utility s IRP to determine if it meets the necessary requirements and whether it should be acknowledged. In February 2022, the ACC acknowledged APS s 2020 IRP filed on June 26, 2020. The ACC also approved certain amendments to the IRP process, including, setting an energy efficiency savings of 1.3 of retail sales annually (averaged over a three-year period) and a demand-side resource capacity of 35 of 2020 peak demand by January 1, 2030.

million annually in equity infusions from Pinnacle West without seeking ACC approval. APS sought approval under Arizona Administrative Code provision R14-2-803 to receive from Pinnacle West in 2024 up to million in additional equity infusions above the currently authorized limit of million annually. The ACC approved the increased equity infusion limit for 2024 on January 9, 2024 and subsequently issued the order on January 24, 2024. 
 
 On April 19, 2024, APS submitted a request to the ACC to permanently modify Pinnacle West s permitted yearly equity infusions to equal up to of Pinnacle West s consolidated assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act 
 
 Under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 PURPA ), qualifying facilities are provided the right to sell energy and/or capacity to utilities and are granted relief from certain regulatory burdens. On December 17, 2019, the ACC mandated a minimum contract length of 18 years for qualifying facilities over 100 kW in Arizona and established that the rate paid to qualifying facilities must be based on the long-term avoided cost. Avoided cost is generally defined as the price at which the utility could purchase or produce the same amount of power from sources other than the qualifying facility on a long-term basis. 
 
 Residential Electric Utility Customer Service Disconnections 
 
 In accordance with the ACC s service disconnection rules, APS uses a calendar-based method to suspend the disconnection of customers for nonpayment from June 1 through October 15 each year Annual Disconnection Moratorium ). Customers with past due balances of or greater as of the end of the Annual Disconnection Moratorium are automatically placed on six-month payment arrangements. In addition, APS voluntarily began waiving late payment fees of its customers Late Fee Waivers on March 13, 2020. Effective February 1, 2023, late payment fees for residential customers were reinstated. Late payment fees for commercial and industrial customers were reinstated effective May 1, 2022. Since the suspensions and moratoriums on disconnections began, APS has experienced an increase in bad debt expense and the related write-offs of delinquent customer accounts. 
 
 Retail Electric Competition Rules 
 
 On November 17, 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona. On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules

million annual revenue impact that would be applied as a percentage of base rates for all applicable customers. Also, as provided for in the 2017 Rate Case Decision, APS requested that the adjustment become effective no later than January 1, 2019. The hearing for this matter occurred in September 2018. At the hearing, APS accepted ACC Staff s recommendation of a lower annual revenue impact of approximately million. The Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order finding that the costs for the SCR project were prudently incurred and recommending authorization of the million annual revenue requirement related to the installation and operation of the SCRs. The ACC did not issue a decision on this matter. APS included the costs for the SCR project in the retail rate base in its 2019 Rate Case filing with the ACC. 
 
 On November 2, 2021, the 2019 Rate Case decision was approved by the ACC allowing approximately million of SCR related plant investments and cost deferrals in rate base and to recover, depreciate and amortize in rates based on an end-of-life assumption of July 2031. The decision also included a partial and combined disallowance of million on the SCR investments and deferrals. APS believes the SCR plant investments and related SCR cost deferrals were prudently incurred, and on December 17, 2021, APS filed its Notice of Direct Appeal at the Arizona Court of Appeals requesting review of the million disallowance. The Arizona Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on November 30, 2022. On March 6, 2023, the Court of Appeals issued its order in the matter, vacating the ACC s disallowance of the SCR investment and remanding the matter back to the ACC for further review in accordance with ACC rules and the order of the Court of Appeals. On June 21, 2023, the ACC approved a joint settlement filed by APS and the ACC s Legal Division that resolved all issues relating to the 2019 Rate Case decision, including recovery of the cost of the Four Corners SCRs. See above for further discussion on the 2019 Rate Case decision. 
 
 Cholla 
 
 On September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close Unit 2 of the Cholla Power Plant Cholla and cease burning coal at the other APS-owned units (Units 1 and 3) at the plant by the mid-2020s, if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA approved a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules. On April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS s plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS s remaining investment in the unit. APS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015. In early 2017, EPA approved a final rule incorporating APS s compromise proposal, which took effect on April 26, 2017. In December 2019, PacifiCorp notified APS that it planned to retire Cholla Unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in December 2020. APS is required to cease burning coal at its remaining Cholla units by April 2025.

million as of September 30, 2024, in addition to a return on its investment. In accordance with GAAP, in the third quarter of 2014, Unit 2 s remaining net book value was reclassified from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset. In accordance with the 2019 Rate Case decision, the regulatory asset is being amortized through 2033. 
 
 On August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order associated with unrecovered book value and closure costs of the remaining Cholla units. This order would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, both the expenses necessary to close and decommission coal-fired power plant infrastructure at Cholla, including but not limited to legally required site environmental remediation, coal-combustion residual CCR corrective actions, the closure of CCR management facilities, and any unrecovered plant investment and operating costs incurred through and after April 2025. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Navajo Plant 
 
 The Navajo Plant ceased operations in November 2019. The co-owners and the Navajo Nation executed a lease extension on November 29, 2017, that allows for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations. In accordance with GAAP, in the second quarter of 2017, APS s remaining net book value of its interest in the Navajo Plant was reclassified from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset. 
 
 APS has been recovering a return on and of the net book value of its interest in the Navajo plant in base rates over its previously estimated life through 2026. Pursuant to the 2019 Rate Case decision described above, APS will be allowed continued recovery of the book value of its remaining investment in the Navajo plant, million as of September 30, 2024, in addition to a return on the net book value, with the exception of of the annual amortization expense in rates. In addition, APS will be allowed recovery of other costs related to retirement and closure, including the Navajo coal reclamation regulatory asset, million as of September 30, 2024. The disallowed recovery of of the annual amortization does not have a material impact on APS financial statements. 
 
 Fire Mitigation 
 
 On August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

 The leases terms give APS the ability to utilize the assets for a significant portion of the assets economic life, and therefore provide APS with the power to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. Predominantly due to the lease terms, APS has been deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and therefore consolidates the VIEs.

million and million respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, of million and million, respectively. The increase in net income is entirely attributable to the noncontrolling interests. Income attributable to Pinnacle West shareholders is not impacted by the consolidation. 
 
 Equity Noncontrolling interests 
 
 Assets of the VIEs are restricted and may only be used for payment to the noncontrolling interest holders. These assets are reported on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 APS is exposed to losses relating to these VIEs upon the occurrence of certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain circumstances (for example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to make specified payments to the VIEs noncontrolling equity participants and take title to the leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If such an event were to occur during the lease periods, APS may be required to pay the noncontrolling equity participants approximately million beginning in 2024, and up to million over the lease extension terms. 
 
 For regulatory ratemaking purposes, the agreements continue to be treated as operating leases and, as a result, we have recorded a regulatory asset relating to the arrangements.

 Energy Derivative Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 
 Our energy derivative transactions are typically executed under standardized or customized agreements, which include collateral requirements and, in the event of a default, would allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Agreements that allow for the offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty are considered master netting arrangements. Transactions with counterparties that have master netting arrangements are offset and reported

 Credit Risk and Credit Related Contingent Features 
 
 We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by energy derivative counterparties and have risk management contracts with many energy derivative counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, we have no counterparties with positive exposures of greater than 10 of Pinnacle West s risk management assets. Our risk management process assesses and monitors the financial exposure of all counterparties. Despite the fact that the great majority of our trading counterparties debt is rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these counterparties could default, resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a given period. Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of financial institutions, major energy companies, municipalities and local distribution companies. We maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable limits. Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition. To manage credit risk, we employ collateral requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties. 
 
 Certain of our energy derivative instrument contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, investment grade credit rating provisions, credit-related cross-default provisions, and adequate assurance provisions. Adequate assurance provisions allow a counterparty with reasonable grounds for uncertainty to demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. For those energy derivative instruments in a net liability position, with investment grade credit contingencies, the counterparties could demand additional collateral if our debt credit rating were to fall below investment grade (below BBB- for Standard Poor s or Fitch or Baa3 for Moody s).

 claims pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement, for separate time periods during July 1, 2011, through October 31, 2023. The DOE has approved and paid million for these claims (APS s share is million). The amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income. In accordance with the 2017 Rate Case Decision, this regulatory liability is being refunded to customers. See Note 4 . On 
 October 31, 2024, APS filed its eleventh claim pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014, settlement agreement in the amount of million (APS s share is million). 
 
 Nuclear Insurance 
 
 Public liability for incidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Price-Anderson Act ), which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both commercial sources and an industry-wide retrospective payment plan. This insurance limit is subject to an adjustment every five years based upon the aggregate percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The most recent adjustment took effect on January 1, 2024. As of that date, in accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, the Palo Verde participants are insured against public liability for a nuclear incident up to approximately billion per occurrence. Palo Verde maintains the maximum

 COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million, which is provided by American Nuclear Insurers . The remaining balance of approximately billion of liability coverage is provided through a mandatory, industry-wide retrospective premium program. If losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be responsible for retrospective premiums. The maximum retrospective premium per reactor under the program for each nuclear liability incident is approximately million, subject to a maximum annual premium of approximately million per incident. Based on APS s ownership interest in the Palo Verde units, APS s maximum retrospective premium per incident for all units is approximately million, with a maximum annual retrospective premium of approximately million. 
 
 The Palo Verde participants maintain insurance for property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of billion. APS has also secured accidental outage insurance for a sudden and unforeseen accidental outage of any of the units. The property damage, decontamination, and accidental outage insurance are provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited NEIL ). APS is subject to retrospective premium adjustments under all NEIL policies if NEIL s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds. The maximum amount APS could incur under the current NEIL policies totals approximately million for each retrospective premium assessment declared by NEIL s Board of Dire ctors due to losses. Additionally, at the sole discretion of the NEIL Board of Directors, APS would be liable to provide approximately million in deposit premium within days of request as assurance to satisfy any site obligation of retrospective premium assessment. The insurance coverage discussed in this, and the previous paragraph, is subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits, and exclusions. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments and Purchase Obligations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our fuel and purchased power commitments and purchase obligations have increased by billion from the information provided in our 2023 Form 10-K. The increase is primarily due to new energy storage PPAs and other purchased power commitments, in addition to three new engineering, procurement, and construction contracts relating to APS-owned capital generation projects. The majority of these changes relate to 2026 and thereafter. The purchased power commitments include certain agreements that qualify as lease agreements. See Note 14. 
 
 Other than the items de scribed above, there have been no material changes, as of September 30, 2024, outside the normal course of business in contractual obligations from the information provided in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 3 for discussion regarding changes in our short-term and long-term debt obligations. 
 
 Superfund and Other Related Matters 
 
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act Superfund or CERCLA establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil, water or air. Those who released, generated, transported to or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible (each a PRP ). PRPs may be strictly, jointly, and severally liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, EPA advised APS that EPA considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52nd Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 OU3 in Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West have agreed with EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within OU3. In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study RI/FS ). The RI/FS for OU3 was finalized and submitted to EPA at the end of 2022. EPA notified APS that the RI/FS was approved on September 11, 2024. APS s estimated costs related to this investigation and study is approximately million. APS anticipates incurring additional

 COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million in remediation legal expenses. APS is unable to predict the outcome of any further litigation related to this claim or APS s share of liability related to that claim; however, APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 On February 28, 2022, EPA provided APS with a request for information under CERCLA related to APS s Ocotillo power plant site located in Tempe, Arizona. In particular, EPA seeks information from APS regarding APS s use, storage, and disposal of substances containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl PFAS compounds at the Ocotillo power plant site in order to aid EPA s investigation into actual or threatened releases of PFAS into groundwater within the South Indian Bend Wash SIBW Superfund site. The SIBW Superfund site includes the APS Ocotillo power plant site. APS filed its response to this information request on April 29, 2022. On January 17, 2023, EPA contacted APS to inform the Company that it would be commencing on-site investigations within the SIBW site, including the Ocotillo power plant, and performing a remedial investigation and feasibility study related to potential PFAS impacts to groundwater over the next two to three years. APS estimates that its costs to oversee and participate in the remedial investigation work will be approximately million. At the present time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter, and any further expenditures related to necessary remediation, if any, or further investigations cannot be reasonably estimated. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions of both conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste, hazardous waste, and CCRs. These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on APS resulting in increased capital, operating, and other costs. Associated capital expenditures or operating costs could be material. APS intends to seek recovery of any such environmental compliance costs through our rates but cannot predict whether it will obtain such recovery. The following proposed and final rules could involve material compliance costs to APS. 
 
 Coal Combustion Waste . On December 19, 2014, EPA issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, such as fly ash and bottom ash. The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions. These criteria include standards governing location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements. The rule generally requires any existing unlined CCR surface impoundment to stop receiving CCR and either retrofit or close, and further requires the closure of any CCR landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity. Such closure requirements are deemed forced closure or closure for cause of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of the regulatory and judicial activities described below.

MW solar and battery storage facility in O ahu, Hawaii that supplies energy and capacity under a -year power purchase agreement with Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. The K pono Solar Project achieved commercial operations in June 2024. On April 18, 2023, the K pono special purpose entity entered into a million non-recourse construction financing agreement. On August 14, 2024, the construction financing converted into long-term financing in the form of a sale-leaseback. In connection with the project financing, Pinnacle West issued performance guarantees relating to the K pono Solar Project. Investments in the K pono Solar Project were included in the BCE Sale which closed on January 12, 2024, and as a result of the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West holds no equity or ownership interest in the K pono Solar Project. As of September 30, 2024, Pinnacle West continues to maintain performance guarantees relating to the K pono Solar Project sale-leaseback financing (see additional information below regarding these guarantees). See Note 16 for information relating to the BCE Sale.

million and surety bonds totaled approximately million; both will expire through 2025. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected on our balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves. 
 
 We enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements. Most significantly, APS has agreed to indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions with respect to certain tax matters. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on historical experience and evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such indemnification provisions is likely. 
 
 Pinnacle West has issued parental guarantees and has provided indemnification under certain surety bonds for APS which were not material at September 30, 2024. In connection with the sale of 4C Acquisition, LLC s interest to Navajo Transitional Energy Corporation NTEC ), Pinnacle West is guaranteeing certain obligations that NTEC will have to the other owners of Four Corners. Pinnacle West has not needed to perform under this guarantee. A maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the guarantee and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantee cannot be reasonably estimated; however, we consider the fair value of this guarantee, including expected credit losses, to be immaterial. 
 
 In connection with PNW Power s investments in minority ownership positions in the Clear Creek wind farm in Missouri and Nobles 2 wind farm in Minnesota, Pinnacle West has guaranteed the obligations of PNW Power to make production tax credit funding payments to borrowers of the projects (the PTC Guarantees ). The amounts guaranteed by Pinnacle West are reduced as payments are made under the respective guarantee agreements. As of September 30, 2024, there is approximately million of remaining guarantees relating to these PTC Guarantees that are expected to terminate by 2030. 
 
 Pinnacle West has issued various performance guarantees in connection with the K pono Solar Project investment financing and is exposed to losses relating to these guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events that we consider to be remote. Subsequent to the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West continues to maintain these guarantees. See Note 16. Pinnacle West has not needed to perform under these guarantees. Maximum obligations are not explicitly stated in the guarantees and cannot be reasonably estimated. Ameresco is obligated to reimburse Pinnacle West for any payments made by Pinnacle West under such guarantees. We consider the fair value of these guarantees, including expected credit losses, to be immaterial. The details of the guarantees are as follows: 
 
 Pinnacle West committed to certain performance guarantees tied to the K pono Solar Project achieving certain construction and operation milestones. These performance guarantees expired in August 2024. Pinnacle West has no on-going exposure under these construction-related guarantees.

 shares of Pinnacle West common stock that may be settled at our discretion no later than September 4, 2025. The forward sale price was initially per share and is subject to certain adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Equity Forward Sale Agreements through the date of settlements. On a settlement date, Pinnacle West will issue shares of common stock and receive cash at the then-applicable forward sale price. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Equity Forward Sale Agreements have not been settled. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the Equity Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of shares of common stock in exchange for cash of million. We will not receive any proceeds from the Equity Forward Sale Agreements until the settlement with shares occurs, and upon settlement, we will record the proceeds, if any, in equity. The terms of the Equity Forward Sale Agreements also allow Pinnacle West, at our option, to settle the Equity Forward Sale Agreements with the counterparties by delivering cash, in lieu of shares. 
 
 We have classified the Equity Forward Sale Agreements as an equity transaction. As a result, no amounts have been recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to the Equity Forward Sale Agreements as of September 30, 2024. Delivery of shares to settle the Equity Forward Sale Agreements will eventually result in dilution to basic earnings per share EPS upon settlement. Prior to settlement, the potentially issuable shares are reflected in our diluted EPS calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of Pinnacle West common stock used in calculating diluted EPS for a reporting period is increased by the number of shares, if any, that would be issued upon settlement less that number of shares that could be purchased by Pinnacle West in the market with the proceeds received from issuance (based on the average market price during that reporting period). Share dilution occurs when the average market price of our stock during the reporting period is higher than the adjusted forward sale price as of the end of the reporting period. 
 
 In June 2024, Pinnacle West issued million of convertible senior notes that will mature on June 15, 2027. The Convertible Notes conversion options are indexed to Pinnacle West s common stock. See Note 3.

 separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2 and related common facilities. These lessor trust entities have been deemed VIEs for which APS is the primary beneficiary. As the primary beneficiary, APS consolidated these lessor trust entities. The impacts of these sale leaseback transactions are excluded from our lease disclosures as lease accounting is eliminated upon consolidation. See Note 6 for a discussion of VIEs. 
 
 APS has purchased power lease agreements that allow APS the right to the generation capacity from certain natural-gas fueled generators during certain months of each year throughout the term of the arrangements. As APS only has rights to use the assets during certain periods of each year, the leases have non-consecutive periods of use. APS does not operate or maintain the leased assets. APS controls the dispatch of the leased assets during the months of use and is required to pay a fixed monthly capacity payment during these periods of use. For these types of leased assets, APS has elected to combine both the lease and non-lease payment components and accounts for the entire fixed payment as a lease obligation. In addition to the fixed monthly capacity payments, APS must also pay variable charges based on the actual production volume of the assets. The variable consideration is not included in the measurement of our lease obligation. 
 
 APS has executed various energy storage purchased power lease agreements that allow APS the right to charge and discharge energy storage facilities. APS pays a fixed monthly capacity price for rights to use the lease assets. The agreements generally have -year lease terms and provide APS with the exclusive use of the energy storage assets through the lease term. APS does not operate or maintain the energy storage facilities and has no purchase options or residual value guarantees relating to these lease assets. For this class of energy storage lease assets, APS has elected to separate the lease and non-lease components. These leases are accounted for as operating leases, with lease terms that commenced between September 2023 and August 2024.

Payments under most renewable purchased power lease contracts are dependent upon environmental factors, and due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reliability of the fuel source, the payments are considered variable and are excluded from the measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use lease assets. Certain of our lease agreements have lease terms with non-consecutive periods of use. For these agreements, we recognize lease costs during the periods of use. Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less are considered short-term leases and are not recorded on the balance sheets.

billion over the terms of the agreements. These arrangements primarily relate to energy storage assets. We expect lease commencement dates ranging from March 2025 through May 2027, with lease terms expiring through May 2046. The lease commencement dates for certain arrangements have experienced delays. APS is working with the lessors to determine the expected commencement dates of these arrangements which may commence prior to March 2025, subject to the lessor achieving certain operational provisions. As a result of these delays and other events, APS has received cash proceeds from certain lessors prior to lease commencement. Proceeds received from lessors relating to energy storage PPA leases are accounted for as lease incentives on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and upon lease commencement are amortized over the associated lease term. For regulatory purposes, the proceeds received by APS relating to these PPA leases are treated as a reduction to fuel and purchased power costs through the PSA in the period proceeds are received.

 APS has also recorded the initial investigation and assessment costs related to the newly signed EPA rule for Legacy Impoundments and CCRMUs. At this time, APS is still estimating the financial impacts of this final regulation on its business, with initial CCRMU site surveys due to be completed by February 2026 and final site investigation reports to be finalized by February 2027. Based on the information available to the Company at this time, APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the entire CCRMU asset retirement obligation. Depending on the outcome of those evaluations and site investigations, the costs associated with APS s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and APS s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Combined Notes that appear in Item 1 of this report. For information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see Forward-Looking Statements at the front of this report and Risk Factors in Part 1, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this report. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 Pinnacle West is an investor-owned electric utility holding company based in Phoenix, Arizona with consolidated assets of approximately 26 billion. Since 1886, Pinnacle West and our affiliates have provided energy and energy-related products to people and businesses throughout Arizona. 
 
 Pinnacle West derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary, APS. APS is Arizona s largest and longest-serving electric company that generates safe, affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 1.4 million retail customers in 11 of Arizona s 15 counties. APS is also the operator and co-owner of Palo Verde Generating Station Palo Verde a primary source of electricity for the southwestern United States. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA significantly expands the availability of tax credits for investments in clean energy generation technologies and energy storage. Key provisions that are relevant to APS s clean energy commitment include (i) an extension of tax credits for solar and wind generation, including a new option for solar investments to claim a Production Tax Credit PTC in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit ITC beginning in 2022; (ii) expansion of the ITC to cover stand-alone energy storage technology beginning in 2023; (iii) introduction of technology neutral clean energy ITCs and PTCs beginning in 2025; and (iv) introduction of a new PTC for nuclear energy produced by existing nuclear energy plants, available from 2024 through 2032. The Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury Department have issued preliminary guidance related to various provisions of the IRA that have enabled APS to claim credits related to its solar and energy storage investments. The Company continues to await regulations and other guidance, including with respect to the nuclear PTC, which will provide additional details and clarifications regarding how the Company may be able to claim IRA tax credits. See Note 17 for more information. 
 
 Strategic Overview 
 
 Our strategy is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona that delivers shareholder value and shared value by serving our customers with reliable, affordable, and clean energy. 
 
 Customer-Focused 
 
 Recognizing that creating customer value is inextricably linked to increasing shareholder value, APS s focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves. Accordingly, it is APS s goal to achieve an industry-leading, best-in-class customer experience. In furtherance of a customer-centric culture, APS 
 74 

Table of Contents 

 employees have delivered an enhanced customer experience in recent years through a number of past and ongoing initiatives, such as improving the ease-of-use of APS s automated phone system, improving the speed of answering customer calls, advancing phone advisor soft skill development through updated training curriculum, and adding 1,100-plus in-person payment locations, as well as introducing new customer payment channels. APS also implemented numerous enhancements to its website, including improving page-loading speeds, adding user-friendly dashboards, and making content more simple, relevant, and useful. APS enhanced other customer touchpoints, such as communications throughout outages and the online outage center in addition to continuing to communicate with customers in their preferred channels about topics that matter most to them, such as reliability, energy-efficiency, financial assistance, the environment, and programs that enable them to design their own personalized energy experience. To further improve customer communications, APS expanded the use of email and text alerts, notifications, and communications to customers related to outages and their account and service status. Finally, APS continues to focus on employee learning, training, tools, and resources to ensure all employees understand their role in APS customers experiences. 
 
 Additionally, APS has implemented a variety of financial assistance programs to support customers struggling to pay their energy bills. Among these assistance programs are discounts for qualified limited-income customers, including a new tier with larger discounts for APS s lowest income customers added in the second quarter of 2024 and other non-income-based assistance programs, such as flexible payment arrangements and emergency utility bill assistance. To ensure our most vulnerable customers are connected to these programs, we train and partner with more than one hundred community action agencies across our service territory. 
 
 Reliable 
 
 While our energy mix evolves, APS s commitment to deliver reliable service to our customers remains. APS is managing through significant growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area while experiencing supply chain issues similar to those experienced in other industries. 
 
 Planned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid, updating technology, accommodating customer growth, and enabling more renewable energy resources. To prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in customer energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan (the Ten-Year Transmission Plan ). The Ten-Year Transmission Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represent a significant upgrade to our transmission system. These five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Transmission Plan, will support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources. 
 
 Our advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages and control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid. The system will also integrate a new meter data management system that will increase grid visibility and give customers access to more of their energy usage data. 
 
 Wildfire safety remains a critical focus for APS and other utilities. We have increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure, continue ongoing system upgrades, build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities. We also increased spend on mitigating the risk associated with trees that could cause hazards, resulting in more of these trees being removed before they could cause outages or wildfires. These programs contribute to customer reliability, responsible forest management and safe communities. With recent wildfire events in Hawaii and across North America, we have been devoting and will continue to devote substantial efforts to analyzing and developing enhancements to our systems and processes to mitigate fire risk within our service territory and communities, including by hardening our infrastructure, deploying new technologies where 
 75

 appropriate, increasing our awareness, implementing operational changes, and enhancing our wildfire response capabilities. APS completed implementation of best-in-class fire modelling software that we are utilizing to more surgically identify and calculate risk and target future system improvement investments such as fire-resistant pole wrapping, wood to steel pole conversions, and additional remote-controllable field devices like reclosers and switches. APS also has implemented a public safety power shutoff PSPS program that began in the 2024 fire season, leveraging the additional real-time analysis provided by the new modelling software, and has educated and is continuing education outreach to customers and communities that may potentially be impacted by the PSPS program. APS continues to evaluate policy and regulatory options, as well as insurance programs, to mitigate the impact of wildfire events. 
 
 For example, on August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. See Note 4 for more information. 
 
 Additionally, APS was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy s Grid Deployment Office GDO to receive up to 70 million in federal money for fire mitigation and grid infrastructure projects. This funding is part of the GDO s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership Program and is contingent on APS negotiating and executing final grant agreements with GDO. 
 
 Maintaining reliability and affordability for customers during the clean energy transition is fundamental to APS s strategy. Serving in an essential back-up role, dispatchable natural gas generators provide energy during times when solar and wind resource output is insufficient to meet customer demand. In addition to the previously added natural gas units at the modernized Ocotillo Power Plant in 2019 and efficiency improvements to gas units at the Redhawk, Sundance, and West Phoenix Power Plants in 2024, APS has contracted for two simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 90 MW in total) at the Sundance Power Plant, which are expected to be in service in 2026, and eight simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 397 MW in total) at the Redhawk Power Plant, which are expected to be in service in 2028. APS continues to evaluate and pursue options for reliably serving growing customer energy needs and demand. 
 
 In October 2021, APS announced plans to evaluate regional market solutions as part of the Western Markets Exploratory Group WMEG ). As a member of WMEG, APS explored the potential for a staged approach to new market services, including day-ahead energy sales, transmission system expansion, and other power supply and grid solutions consistent with existing regulations and known and expected market design. APS utilizes the work done by WMEG to help identify market solutions that can help achieve carbon reduction goals while supporting reliable, affordable service for customers. APS anticipates a day ahead market selection in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 APS went live with a new Energy Management System EMS in April 2024. APS expects the new EMS to provide a better foundation which will improve future integration of the renewable and energy storage assets into APS s generation resource portfolio, allowing APS to maximize the flexibility of its resources and fully engage in the Energy Imbalance Market. APS also believes it will better position APS to participate in market opportunities that develop over the next decade. 
 
 APS s key elements to delivering reliable power include resource planning, sufficient reserve margins, partnering with customers to manage peak demand, fire mitigation, and operational preparedness, among others. Seasonal readiness procedures at APS include inspections to ensure good material conditions and critical control system surveys. APS also plans for the unexpected by conducting emergency operations drills and coordinating with federal, state, and local agencies on fire and emergency management.

 Affordable 
 
 APS continues to focus on mitigating the cost pressures related to the current inflationary environment. Overall inflation grew by 2.3 in Phoenix and 2.5 nationally over the twelve months ended August 2024. Although inflationary impacts to APS have begun to slow in 2024, APS is still managing the previously high inflationary market. 
 
 APS s customer affordability initiative includes internal opportunities, such as training and mentoring employees on identifying efficiency opportunities; maintaining an inventory to take advantage of lower pricing and avoid expediting fees; entering into long-term contracts to hedge against price volatility, which has allowed APS to mitigate against procurement spend areas such as transformers; and implementing automation technologies to enhance efficiencies and increase data-oriented decision making. 
 
 There are also external opportunities under APS s customer affordability initiative, such as APS s participation in the Western Energy Imbalance Market WEIM ). WEIM continues to be a tool for creating savings for APS s customers from the real-time, voluntary market. APS continues to expect that its participation in WEIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS s renewable resources. APS participated in market design and tariff development of Markets+, a day-ahead and real-time market offering from Southwest Power Pool that was filed with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC on March 29, 2024. The Markets+ Tariff is currently pending approval at FERC with an expected order in November 2024. APS also participated in the design and drafting of the tariff for the CAISO s Extended Day-Ahead Market, which was approved by FERC in December 2023. In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by Western Power Pool and is transitioning to full binding participation as early as summer 2027. These regional efforts are driven by three objectives of reducing customer cost, improving reliability, and incorporating more clean energy on APS s system. 
 
 In terms of generation affordability, every three years, APS performs a comprehensive study, called an Integrated Resource Plan IRP ), to identify what resources will be necessary to safely and reliably meet the demand and energy needs of its customers over the next 15 years. In November 2023, APS released its latest IRP, which identified forecasted customer demand and energy needs growing at an unprecedented rate. In developing the IRP, APS considered how factors such as forecasted economic growth, new resource technology availability, and weather impact the amount and type of resources required to reliably meet customer needs. These factors, among others, were used to develop a plan that identified a balanced mix of diverse energy generating resources to reliably serve customers future energy needs in the most affordable and sustainable manner possible. To help ensure competitive costs for resources procured by APS, APS regularly issues competitive bid solicitations through an all-source request for proposal ASRFP process, with the most recent ASRFPs being issued in 2022 and 2023. These ASRFPs are open to bids for all resource types, including customer-scale (behind the meter) and utility-scale (in front of the meter) resources. Through the ASRFP process, APS has found that clean resources like wind, solar, and energy storage technology, are important elements of a least cost portfolio. During the clean energy transition, dispatchable resources will play a vital role in maintaining grid reliability by serving as a back-up to intermittent energy resources when output is insufficient to meet customer needs. Over the long term, each resource in a balanced and diverse portfolio is expected to provide complementary value and contribute to sustained delivery of reliable electric service. 
 
 In addition to managing the cost of electricity generation, APS has continued building upon existing cost management efforts, including a customer affordability initiative launched in 2019. The initiative was implemented Company-wide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our areas ranging from our business 
 77 

Table of Contents 

 processes and organizational approaches to completing high-value work and achieving internal efficiencies. APS continues to drive this initiative by identifying opportunities to streamline its business processes, mitigate cost increases, increase employee retention, and improve customer satisfaction. 
 
 Clean Energy Commitment 
 
 We are committed to doing our part to build a clean and carbon-free future. As Arizona stewards, we do what is right for the people and prosperity of Arizona. Our vision is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona by providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy to our customers. We can accomplish our vision by collaborating with customers, communities, employees, policymakers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Our clean energy commitment is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for APS s customers. 
 
 APS s clean energy commitment consists of three parts: 
 
 A 2050 goal to provide 100 clean, carbon-free electricity; 
 A 2030 target to achieve a resource mix that is 65 clean energy, with 45 of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and 
 A plan to exit from coal-fired generation by 2031. 
 
 APS s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment depends upon a number of important external factors, including a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, development of clean energy technologies, and continued access to capital markets, among others. 
 
 2050 Goal: 100 Clean, Carbon-Free Electricity. Achieving a fully clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration. Achieving this 2050 goal will require, among other things, innovative thinking, emergent clean energy and storage technologies, upgrades and expansions to the grid, and supportive public policy. 
 
 2030 Goal: 65 Clean Energy. APS has an energy mix that is already more than 50 clean and plans to continue to add more renewables and energy storage. By building on those plans, APS intends to attain an energy mix that is 65 clean by 2030, with 45 of APS s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. Clean is measured as percent of energy mix, which includes all carbon-free resources like nuclear, renewables, and demand-side management. Renewable energy includes generation resources such as solar, wind, and biomass, and is measured in accordance with the Arizona Corporation Commission s (the ACC Renewable Energy Standard as a percentage of retail sales. This target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning, investment strategy, and customer affordability efforts as APS moves toward a 100 clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050. 
 
 2031 Goal: Exit Coal-Fired Generation. The plan to exit coal-fired generation by 2031 will require APS to stop relying on coal-generation at the Four Corners Power Plant Four Corners ). APS has permanently retired more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired electric generating capacity. These closures and other measures taken by APS have resulted in annual carbon emissions that were 36 lower in 2023 compared to 2005. In addition, APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla Power Plant units during 2025. 
 
 In June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners as early as fall 2023, subject to the necessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership. Under seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 and spring. The other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages. As of the date of this report, APS has elected not to begin seasonal operation due to market conditions. 
 
 Renewables. APS s IRP identifies a diverse mix of resources adequate to maintain grid reliability while serving increasing future customer energy needs. Our IRP shows that renewable and clean resources are an important part of a reliable, cost effective portfolio. APS seeks market-based pricing of procured resources through regular solicitation of project bids using its competitive ASRFP process. 
 
 APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned resources, including solar, wind, energy storage, nuclear, geothermal, biomass and biogas, that supports our commitment to clean energy. This commitment is already strengthened by Palo Verde, one of the nation s largest carbon-free, clean energy resources, which provides the foundation for reliable and affordable service for APS customers. APS s longer-term clean energy strategy includes pursuing the right mix of purchased power contracts for new resources, procurement of new resources to be owned by APS, and the ongoing development of distributed energy resources. Maintaining a balanced and diverse portfolio of resources will ensure continued reliable service to our customers in the most affordable manner possible. 
 
 APS uses competitive ASRFPs to pursue market-priced resources that meet its system needs and offer the best value for customers. APS selects projects based on cost, ability to meet system requirements and commercial viability, taking into consideration timing and likelihood of successful contracting and development. Under current market conditions, APS must aggressively contract for resources that can withstand supply chain and other geopolitical pressures. Guided by IRP-established timelines and quantities, APS maintains a flexible approach that allows it to optimize system reliability and customer affordability through the ASRFP process. Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection to the electric grid. 
 
 On June 30, 2023, APS issued an ASRFP (the 2023 ASRFP seeking approximately 1,000 MW of reliable capacity, including at least 700 MW of renewable resources with a focus on in-service dates between 2026 and 2028. Bids from the 2023 ASRFP were received on September 6, 2023, and APS is negotiating on multiple projects and executed agreements on multiple others. These projects include the following facilities that APS will own and operate: a 168 MW solar facility, a 150 MW battery facility, 90 MW of natural gas at the Sundance Power Plant, and 397 MW of natural gas at the Redhawk Power Plant. In addition to the APS-owned projects, APS has also contracted for 500 MW of wind resources, 2,150 MW of solar plus storage resources, 1,100 MW of stand-alone battery resources, 150 MW of solar resources, and 30 MW via an existing natural gas toll uprate.

 Palo Verde . Palo Verde, one of the nation s largest carbon-free, clean energy resources, will continue to be a foundational part of APS s resource portfolio. Palo Verde is not just the cornerstone of our current clean energy mix; it also is a significant provider of clean energy to the southwestern United States. The plant is a critical asset to the Southwest, generating more than 32 million MWh annually enough power for roughly 3.4 million households, or approximately 8.5 million people. Its continued operation is important to a carbon-free and clean energy future for Arizona and the region, a s a reliable, continuous, affordable resource and as a large contributor to the local economy. 
 
 Developing Clean Energy Technologies 
 
 Electric Vehicles 
 
 As a part of the statewide transportation electrification plan TE Plan adopted in 2021, the ACC approved a target of 450,000 light-duty electric vehicles EVs in its service territory by 2030. APS s Take Charge AZ TCAZ program has helped to deploy Level 2 EV charging stations on customer properties for fleet, public, and workplace EV charging. As of September 30, 2024, APS energized 825 Level 2 charging ports at 196 customer locations. Additionally, APS has energized direct current fast charging DCFC stations that are owned and operated by APS at five locations in Arizona: Sedona, Prescott, Globe, Show Low, and Payson. Effective December 12, 2023, the TCAZ program was discontinued by the ACC. As part of that decision, APS was permitted to complete certain projects that were in process as of December 12, 2023. 
 
 Additionally, as part of APS s DSM Implementation Plan, APS launched the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot to proactively address the growing electric demand from charging as EVs become more widely adopted. The EV programs in the DSM Implementation Plan include APS SmartCharge (an EV data gathering program), Fleet Advisory Services, and a 100 rebate to home builders for new homes to be built EV-ready with 240V receptacle. APS previously offered a 250 residential rebate to customers that purchased a qualifying home Level 2 charger. Effective December 12, 2023, APS discontinued this rebate per the ACC decision. See the discussion above. 
 
 APS filed its 2024 DSM Implementation Plan on November 30, 2023. The 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes APS s 2024 TE Plan and, among other things, proposes two new programs: an expanded residential EV Managed Charging program and a Commercial EV Make-Ready Program. On April 26, 2024, APS filed an amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan. The amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes an updated budget of 90.9 million to reflect removal of incentive funds for the Level 2 Smart Charger rebate within the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot, an update on the performance incentive calculation, and the withdrawal of tranches two and three of the residential battery pilot. The amended 2024 DSM Plan is still pending ACC review and approval. APS will not file a 2025 DSM Implementation Plan, pending ACC review of the amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan. APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. See Note 4 for more information. 
 
 Carbon Capture 
 
 Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage CCUS technologies can isolate CO 2 and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products. Currently, almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen. CCUS technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise, they are still being tested in real-world conditions. These technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired. APS will continue to monitor this emerging technology, particularly in regard to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency s EPA proposed Greenhouse Gas GHG rule. On April 25, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule that, among other 
 81 

Table of Contents 

 things, requires the installation of carbon capture technology for certain classifications of coal, oil, and natural gas fired electricity generating units dependent upon certain factors, including retirement date and operating capacity. See Note 8 for more information. 
 
 Sustainability Practices 
 
 In 2020, in support of our clean energy commitment and the growing focus on sustainability within our organization, we increased our focus on sustainability by dedicating a new Sustainability Department at Pinnacle West responsible for integrating responsible business practices into the everyday work of the Company. 
 
 The Sustainability Department engaged the Electric Power Research Institute EPRI and leveraged input from employees, large customers, limited-income advocates, economic development groups, environmental non-governmental organizations, leading sustainability academics and other stakeholders to identify and assess the sustainability issues that matter most. In total, 23 Priority Sustainability Issues PSIs were identified and prioritized. The most critical category includes four issues deemed most important and most able to be impacted by our actions: clean energy, customer experience, energy access and reliability, and safety and health. These PSIs provide the foundation for informing our strategic direction, creating a framework for incorporating best practices and driving enterprise-wide alignment and accountability. The Company also benchmarked best practices within the top four PSIs and has utilized this information to identify opportunities for improvement. 
 
 Finally, the Company maintains an annual Corporate Responsibility Report on the Pinnacle West website www.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility ). The report provides information related to the Company s sustainability practices and performance. The information on Pinnacle West s website, including the Corporate Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report. 
 
 Artificial Intelligence 
 
 To address the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology risk and opportunities, APS has developed a cross functional governance structure with leadership and experts from our information technology, cybersecurity, human resources, ethics, supply chain, legal, and nuclear generation teams. This cross functional structure assesses both the opportunities and risks during the technology intake process to ensure compliance with data security and reliability requirements, while observing market trends in this rapidly evolving area. 
 
 Regulatory Overview 
 
 2022 Retail Rate Case 
 
 APS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the 2022 Rate Case seeking an increase in annual retail base rates on the date rates become effective Day 1 of a net 460 million. This Day 1 net impact would have represented a total base revenue deficiency of 772 million, offset by proposed adjustor transfers of cost recovery to annual retail rates and adjustor mechanism modifications. The average annual customer bill impact of APS s request on Day 1 would have been an increase of 13.6 . 
 
 The principal provisions of APS s application were: 
 
 a test year comprised of twelve months ended June 30, 2022, adjusted as described below; 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 an original cost rate base of 10.5 billion, which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the book value of utility assets, net of accumulated depreciation and other credits; 
 the following proposed capital structure and costs of capital: 
 
 Capital Structure Cost of Capital Long-term debt 48.07 3.85 Common stock equity 51.93 10.25 Weighted-average cost of capital 7.17 
 
 a 1 return on the increment of fair value rate base above APS s original cost rate base, as provided for by Arizona law; 
 a rate of 0.038321 per kWh for the portion of APS s retail base rates attributable to fuel and purchased power costs; 
 modification of its adjustment mechanisms including: 
 eliminate the Environmental Improvement Surcharge EIS and collect costs through base rates, 
 eliminate the Lost Fixed Cost Recovery LFCR mechanism and collect costs through base rates and the Demand Side Management DSM Adjustment Charge DSMAC ), 
 maintain as inactive the Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism TEAM ), 
 maintain the Transmission Cost Adjustment TCA mechanism, 
 modify the performance incentive in the DSMAC, and 
 modify the Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge REAC to include recovery of capital carrying costs of APS owned renewable and storage resources; 
 changes to its limited-income program, including a second tier to provide an additional discount for customers with greater need; and 
 twelve months of post-test year plant investments to reflect used and useful projects that will be placed into service prior to July 1, 2023. 
 
 On June 5, 2023, and June 15, 2023, the ACC Staff, the Residential Utility Consumer Office RUCO and other intervenors filed their initial written testimony with the ACC. The ACC Staff recommended, among other things, (i) a 251 million revenue increase or, as an alternative, a 312 million revenue increase, (ii) a 9.6 return on equity, (iii) a 0.0 fair value increment or, as an alternative, a 0.75 fair value increment, and (iv) a continuation of a 12-month post-test year plant. RUCO recommended, among other things, (i) an 84.9 million revenue increase, (ii) an 8.2 return on equity or, as an alternative, an 8.7 return on equity if the ACC imputes a hypothetical capital structure with a 46 equity layer, (iii) a fair value increment of 0.0 , and (iv) a reduction of post-test year plant to six months. 
 
 On July 12, 2023, APS filed rebuttal testimony addressing the ACC Staff and intervenors direct testimonies. The principal provisions of APS s rebuttal testimony were: 
 
 reducing the revenue requirement increase to 383.1 million, which reduced the average annual customer bill impact to an increase of 11.3 ; 
 maintaining a return on equity request of 10.25 ; 
 reducing the increment of fair value rate base return to 0.5 from 1.0 ; 
 maintaining a post-test year plant request of 12 months, plus the Four Corners Effluent Limitation Guidelines ELG project; 
 withdrawing the Payment Fee Removal Proposal (net reduction) which was originally requested in APS s initial application; 
 maintaining the LFCR mechanism and DSMAC as separate adjustors; 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 increasing the PSA annual rate change limit from 0.004/kWh to 0.006/kWh; 
 proposing a new System Reliability Benefit SRB recovery mechanism; 
 maintaining the REAC in its current state; 
 maintaining adjustor base transfers and elimination of EIS; and 
 maintaining the request to recover CCT funding. 
 
 On July 26, 2023, the ACC Staff, RUCO and other intervenors filed their surrebuttal testimony with the ACC. The ACC Staff adjusted their initial recommendations to, among other things, (i) a 281.9 million revenue increase, (ii) a 9.68 return on equity, (iii) a 0.5 fair value increment, (iv) a continuation of a 12-month post-test year plant that includes the Four Corners ELG project, and (v) support of an increase to the annual PSA increase limit to 0.006/kWh. RUCO maintained their direct position and also recommended further review of the PSA in a second phase of the 2022 Rate Case. 
 
 On August 4, 2023, APS filed rejoinder testimony addressing the ACC Staff and intervenors surrebuttal testimonies. APS s rejoinder testimony included final post-test year plant values, reducing the revenue requirement increase to 377.7 million from 383.1 million, which reduced the average annual customer bill impact to an increase of 11.2 . All other major provisions from APS s rebuttal testimony were maintained in its rejoinder testimony. 
 
 On November 6, 2023, and November 21, 2023, APS and stakeholders filed briefs in the 2022 Rate Case. APS s briefs included the reduction of the total revenue requirement increase to 376.2 million and a resulting average annual customer bill impact increase of 11.1 . All other major provisions from APS s rejoinder testimony were maintained in its briefs. ACC Staff s briefs included a proposed total revenue requirement increase from 281.9 million to 282.7 million and also included their support of APS s SRB mechanism, contingent on increased stakeholder outreach. 
 
 On January 25, 2024, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order in the 2022 Rate Case, as corrected on February 6, 2024 (the 2022 Rate Case ROO ). The 2022 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a 523.1 million increase in the annual base rate revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55 return on equity, (iii) a 0.25 return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.36 , (v) 12 months of post-test year plant and the inclusion of the Four Corners ELG project, (vi) the approval of APS s SRB proposal with certain procedural and other modifications, (vii) no additional CCT funding, (viii) a 5.0 return on the prepaid pension asset and a return of 5.35 on the OPEB liability, and (ix) no disallowances on APS s coal contracts. 
 
 The 2022 Rate Case ROO also recommended a number of changes to existing adjustors, including (i) the approval of modified DSM performance incentives and the requested DSM transfer to base rates, (ii) the retention of 1.9 million of REAC in the adjustor rather than base rates, (iii) a partial transfer of 27.1 million of LFCR funds to base rates, and (iv) the adoption of an increase in the annual PSA cap to 0.006/kWh. 
 
 On February 22, 2024, the ACC approved a number of amendments to the 2022 Rate Case ROO that resulted in, among other things, (i) an approximately 491.7 million increase in the annual base revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55 return on equity, (iii) a 0.25 return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.39 , (v) a return set at the Company s weighted average cost of capital on the net prepaid pension asset and net other post-employment benefit liability in rate base, (vi) an adjustment to generation maintenance and outage expense to reflect a more reasonable level of test year costs, (vii) approval of the SRB mechanism with modifications to customer notifications, procedural timelines and the inclusion of any qualifying technology and fuel source bid received through an ASRFP, and (viii) recovery of all DSM costs through the DSMAC rather than through base rates.

 The ACC s decision results in an expected total net annual revenue increase for APS of approximately 253.4 million and a roughly 8 increase to the typical residential customer s bill. The ACC issued the final order for the 2022 Rate Case on March 5, 2024, with the new rates becoming effective for all service rendered on or after March 8, 2024. 
 
 Six intervenors and the Attorney General of Arizona requested rehearing on various issues included in the ACC s decision, such as the grid access charge GAC for solar customers, the SRB, and CCT funding. On April 15, 2024, the ACC granted, in part, the rehearing applications of the Attorney General, Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, Solar Energy Industries Association, and Vote Solar for the limited purpose of reviewing arguments concerning the GAC. Specifically, rehearing was ordered as to whether the GAC rate is just and reasonable, including whether it should be higher or lower, whether the GAC rate constitutes a discriminatory fee to solar customers, and whether omission of a GAC charge is discriminatory to non-solar customers. All other applications for rehearing were denied. The parties seeking rehearing had 30 days after the denial or granting of a request for rehearing to file a notice of appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals. No party filed a notice of appeal within the 30-day period. A limited rehearing was scheduled for the purpose of reviewing the GAC. Written testimony from APS and intervenors for the limited rehearing was filed on September 24, 2024, and rebuttal testimony from parties was filed on October 18, 2024. The limited rehearing began on October 28, 2024. APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. 
 
 2019 Retail Rate Case 
 
 On October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC (the 2019 Rate Case for an annual increase in retail base rates. On August 2, 2021, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order in the 2019 Rate Case (the 2019 Rate Case ROO and issued corrections on September 10 and September 20, 2021. Subsequently, the ACC approved an amended 2019 Rate Case ROO on November 2, 2021. See Note 4 for information regarding the 2019 Rate Case ROO. 
 
 After the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS filed an application for rehearing of the 2019 Rate Case and later filed a Notice of Direct Appeal by APS at the Arizona Court of Appeals, requesting review of certain matters from the 2019 Rate Case decision. The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the ACC s decision in the 2019 Rate Case, remanding the issue to the ACC for further proceedings. On June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to allow recovery of 215.5 million in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction SCR project, a reversal of the 20-basis point reduction to APS s return on equity from 8.9 to 8.7 as a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, and recovery of 59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023. The joint resolution provides for a new Court Resolution Surcharge CRS mechanism, which is designed to recover the 59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates. On June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through the CRS mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 , 22.5 million of the 59.6 million of lost revenue has been recovered. Finally, the CRS tariff has been updated to account for changes to return on equity and depreciation and deferral adjustments approved in Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case. See Note 4 for more information regarding the 2019 Rate Case and Four Corners SCR cost recovery. 
 
 Regulatory Lag Docket 
 
 On January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC s historical test year rules. The ACC requested comments from utilities and interested parties on ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years and hybrid test 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 years. APS filed comments on June 1, 2023. On March 19, 2024, the ACC held a workshop to discuss modifying the state s rate case test year rules. Utilities, including APS, spoke about alternatives to the current rules that could reduce regulatory lag. On April 19, 2024, a letter was filed to the docket by an ACC commissioner discussing the potential benefits of modifying test year rules, including the potentiality of offering utilities to choose the type of test year that best suits them. The letter also recommended that this issue be discussed at the next possible open meeting. On July 9, 2024 at an open meeting, ACC Commissioners discussed objectives of future regulatory lag workshops and voted to schedule at least one more workshop on this topic later this year. The ACC held an additional workshop on October 3, 2024 to discuss formula rate methodologies and their use in ratemaking. The workshop included presentations from representatives of FERC, customer advocates, other stakeholders, and utilities, including APS. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Cholla 
 
 On August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order associated with unrecovered book value and closure costs of the remaining Cholla units. This order would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, both the expenses necessary to close and decommission coal-fired power plant infrastructure at Cholla, including but not limited to legally required site environmental remediation, coal-combustion residual CCR corrective actions, the closure of CCR management facilities, and any unrecovered plant investment and operating costs incurred through and after April 2025. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Fire Mitigation 
 
 On August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 See Note 4 for information regarding additional regulatory matters. 
 
 Financial Strength and Flexibility 
 
 Pinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company. Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock. 
 
 Other Subsidiaries 
 
 Pinnacle West Power, LLC PNW Power . On August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary BCE to Ameresco (the BCE Sale ). The transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages. T he final closing of the BCE Sale was completed on January 12, 2024. See Note 16 for additional details. Certain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to PNW Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West. 
 
 PNW Power s investments include TransCanyon, a 50/50 joint venture that was formed in 2014 with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. TransCanyon is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western

Table of Contents 

 Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners utility affiliates. The U.S. Department of Energy s Grid Deployment Office selected TransCanyon to enter into capacity contract negotiations for up to 25 of the Cross-Tie 500-kilovolt transmission line Cross-Tie as part of the Transmission Facilitation Program. The agreement was executed on June 12, 2024. The proposed Cross-Tie project includes a 214-mile transmission line connecting Utah and Nevada that is intended to help improve grid reliability and relieve congestion on other transmission lines. 
 
 PNW Power s investments also include minority ownership positions in two wind farms operated by Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska Energy Holdings, LLC, the 242 MW Clear Creek and the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind farms. Clear Creek achieved commercial operation in May 2020; however, in the fourth quarter of 2022, PNW Power s equity method investment was fully impaired. Nobles 2 achieved commercial operation in December 2020. Both wind farms deliver power under long-term power purchase agreements PPAs ). PNW Power indirectly owns 9.9 of Clear Creek and 5.1 of Nobles 2.

 The remainder of these investment commitments will be contributed by El Dorado as each investment fund selects and makes investments. 
 
 Key Financial Drivers 
 
 In addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below. We closely monitor these factors to plan for the Company s current needs, and to adjust our expectations, financial budgets and forecasts appropriately. 
 
 Electric Operating Revenues. For the years 2021 through 2023, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 91 of our total operating revenues. Our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline, variations in weather from period to period, customer mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, distributed energy additions, electricity rates and tariffs, the recovery of PSA deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms. These revenue transactions are 
 87 

Table of Contents 

 affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions, including competition, demand, and prices. 
 
 Actual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth. Retail customers in APS s service territory increased 2.1 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior-year period. For the three-year period ended 2023, APS s customer growth averaged 2.1 per year. We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5 to 2.5 for 2024 and 2025 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 through 2027 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period. 
 
 Retail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 5.7 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior-year period. While steady customer growth was somewhat offset by weaker usage among residential customers, energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center and large manufacturing customers. 
 
 For the three-year period ended 2023, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 2.6 , adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations. Due to the expected growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 4.0 to 6.0 for 2024 and 2025 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.0 to 6.0 through 2027, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations. These projected sales growth ranges include the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to 2024 and 2025 growth in the range of 3.0 to 5.0 and to average annual growth in the range of 3.0 to 5.0 through 2027. 
 
 Longer term, APS has been preparing for and can serve significant load growth from residential and business customers. On top of these existing growth trends, APS is also now receiving unprecedented incremental requests for service from extra-large commercial energy users (over 25 MW) with very high energy demands that persist virtually around-the-clock. These incremental requests for service by extra-large energy users far exceed available generation and transmission resource capacity in the Southwest region for the foreseeable future. In April 2023, APS notified prospective extra-large customers without existing commitments from APS that it is not able to commit at this time to future extra-large projects of over 25 MW. Because of the high growth in demand for such projects, APS has developed a prioritization queue that identifies and prioritizes projects while maintaining system reliability and affordability for existing APS customers. APS is exploring available options for securing sufficient electric generation and transmission to meet these projections of future customer needs. 
 
 Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower ramp-up of and/or fewer data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in DG, responses to retail price changes, changes in regulatory standards, and impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. Based on past experience, a 1 variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 20 million, and a 1 variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately 5 million. 
 
 88 

Table of Contents 

 Weather. In forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above, we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data. Our experience indicates that typical variations from normal weather can result in increases and decreases in annual net income of up to 15 million; however, extreme weather variations have resulted in larger annual variations in net income. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Costs. Fuel and purchased power costs included on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas, changes in our generation resource allocation, our hedging program for managing such costs and PSA deferrals and the related amortization. 
 
 Operations and Maintenance Expenses . Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), inflation, unplanned outages, planned outages (typically scheduled in the spring and fall), renewable energy and DSM related expenses (which are mostly offset by the same amount of operating revenues) and other factors. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), and increases in intangible assets and changes in depreciation and amortization rates. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service Credits, Net . Pension and other postretirement non-service credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions. The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costs/credit, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term, the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. We review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary. See Note 5. 
 
 Property Taxes. Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are affected by changes in plant balances related to new investments and improvements to existing facilities, the value of property in service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax rates. The average property tax rate in Arizona for APS, which owns essentially all of our property, was 10.0 of the assessed value for 2023, 10.2 for 2022, and 10.7 for 2021. 
 
 Income Taxes . Income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income, income tax rates, certain deductions, and non-taxable items, such as allowance for funds used during construction AFUDC ). In addition, income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities. See Note 17. 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt. See Note 3 for further details. The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, equity issuances and internally generated cash flow. An allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction. We stop accruing AFUDC on a project when it is placed into service.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Pinnacle West s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily sales supplied under traditional cost-based rate regulation) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. All other segment activities are insignificant. Our regulated electricity segment activities are conducted primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS. 
 
 Operating Results Three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 395 million, compared with consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of 398 million for the prior-year period. The results reflect a decrease of approximately 3 million, primarily as a result of higher operations and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense mostly due to increased plant and intangible assets, higher interest charges, higher income taxes and the timing of recognition for permanent items, partially offset by higher tax credits. These negative factors were partially offset by the favorable impacts of new customer rates and the effects of weather. 
 
 The following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders compared with the prior year for Pinnacle West consolidated and for APS consolidated:

 Operations and maintenance . Operations and maintenance expenses increased 58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to: 
 
 an increase of 15 million related to transmission, distribution, and customer service costs; 
 
 an increase of 15 million related to employee benefit costs; 
 
 an increase of 8 million related to corporate resource costs; 
 
 an increase of 8 million related to costs for renewable energy and similar regulatory programs, which are partially offset in operating revenues and purchased power; 
 
 an increase of 4 million related to non-nuclear generation costs, primarily due to higher operating costs; 
 
 an increase of 4 million related to information technology costs; 
 
 an increase of 2 million related to nuclear generation costs; and 
 
 an increase of 2 million for other miscellaneous factors. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were 26 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to increased plant in service and intangible assets.

 Interest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds and equity funds used during construction. Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used during construction, were 12 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates in the current period. 
 
 Other income and expenses, net. Other income and expenses, net were 7 million lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the gain on the sale of BCE (see Note 16) and lower PSA interest income. The difference between APS s and Pinnacle West s other income and expense, net is primarily related to Pinnacle West s gain on the sale of BCE. 
 
 Income taxes. Income taxes were 17 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to higher pre-tax income, lower tax benefits from AFUDC and the timing of recognition for permanent items, partially offset by higher tax credits.

 Operating Results Nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 616 million, compared with consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of 502 million for the prior-year period. The results reflect an increase of approximately 114 million, primarily as a result of the impacts of new customer rates, increased customer usage and growth, the effects of weather, higher CRS revenue and LFCR revenue, and higher other income mainly due to the gain on the sale of BCE. See Note 16. These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense mostly due to increased plant and intangible assets, higher operations and maintenance expense, higher interest charges, net of AFUDC, higher income taxes, and the timing of recognition for permanent items, partially offset by higher tax credits, and lower transmission revenues. 
 
 The following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders compared with the prior year for Pinnacle West consolidated and for APS consolidated:

 Operations and maintenance . Operations and maintenance expenses increased 61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to: 
 
 an increase of 17 million related to transmission, distribution, and customer service costs; 
 
 an increase of 17 million related to employee benefit costs; 
 
 an increase of 12 million related to costs for renewable energy and similar regulatory programs, which are partially offset in operating revenues and purchased power; 
 
 an increase of 10 million related to information technology costs; 
 
 an increase of 4 million related to corporate resource costs; and 
 
 an increase of 1 million related to non-nuclear generation costs, primarily due to planned outage costs. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were 75 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to increased plant in service and intangible assets. 
 
 Other income and expenses, net. Other income and expenses, net were 16 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the gain on the sale of BCE (see Note 16) partially offset by lower PSA interest income. The difference between APS s and Pinnacle West s other income and expense, net is primarily related to Pinnacle West s gain on the sale of BCE.

 Interest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds and equity funds used during construction. Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used during construction, were 49 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates in the current period, higher allowance for borrowed funds and lower allowance for equity funds. 
 
 Income taxes. Income taxes were 37 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to higher pre-tax income, lower tax benefits from AFUDC and the timing of recognition for permanent items, partially offset by higher tax credits. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 Pinnacle West s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our Board of Directors and based on a number of factors, including our financial condition, payout ratio, free cash flow and other factors. 
 
 Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS and external debt and equity issuances. An ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40 . As defined in the related ACC order, the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. At September 30, 2024, APS s common equity ratio, as defined, was 52 . Its total shareholder equity was approximately 8.1 billion and total capitalization was approximately 15.8 billion. Under this order, APS would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately 6.3 billion, assuming APS s total capitalization remains the same. This restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle West s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders. 
 
 Dividends to Pinnacle West from APS are also dependent on a number of factors including, among others, APS s financial condition and free cash flow, the sources of which vary from quarter-to-quarter due in part to the seasonal nature of electricity demand. APS s sources of cash include cash from operations and external sources of liquidity including long- and short-term external debt financing such as commercial paper, term loan and its revolving credit facility. APS s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt. APS funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, external debt financings and equity infusions from Pinnacle West. 
 
 On December 15, 2022, the ACC issued a financing order reaffirming the previous short-term debt authorization equal to the sum of (i) 7 of APS s capitalization, and (ii) 500 million (which is required to be used for costs relating to purchases of natural gas and power) and approving APS s application filed April 6, 2022 requesting to increase the long-term debt limit from 7.5 billion to 8.0 billion and to exclude financing lease PPAs from the definition of long-term debt for purposes of the ACC financing orders. On April 19, 2024, APS submitted an application to the ACC requesting to increase the long-term debt limit from 8.0 billion to 9.5 billion. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 APS is currently authorized to receive up to 150 million annually in equity infusions from Pinnacle West without seeking ACC approval. On October 27, 2023, APS sought approval from the ACC to receive from Pinnacle West in 2024 up to an additional 500 million in equity infusions above the authorized limit of 150 million, and the ACC approved the increased equity infusion limit for 2024 on January 9, 2024 and subsequently issued the order on January 12, 2024. On April 19, 2024, APS submitted an application to the 
 95 

Table of Contents 

 ACC requesting to increase Pinnacle West s permitted yearly equity infusions to equal up to 2.5 of Pinnacle West s consolidated assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Pinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities that enhance liquidity and provide credit support for accessing commercial paper markets. These credit facilities mature in 2029. See Note 3.

 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 Nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Pinnacle West s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was 1,170 million in 2024, compared to 834 million in 2023, an increase of 336 million in net cash provided, primarily due to 205 million lower fuel and purchased power costs, 161 million higher cash receipts from electric revenues, 46 million lower payments for operations and maintenance costs, 11 million change in net collateral, 8 million lower other taxes and 37 million other changes in working capital, partially offset by 49 million higher income taxes paid, 43 million higher interest payments and 40 million lower customer advances for construction.

 Retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries. Pinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries. The requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan. We contribute at least the minimum amount required under ERISA regulations, but no more than the maximum tax-deductible amount. Under ERISA, the qualified pension plan was 110 funded as of January 1, 2024 and 112 as of January 1, 20 23. Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions. We have not made any voluntary contributions to our pension plan year-to-date in 2024. The minimum required cash contributions for the pension plan are zero for the next three years and we do not expect to make any voluntary contributions in 2024, 2025 or 2026. Regarding contributions to our other postretirement benefit plan, we have not made a contribution year-to-date in 2024 and do not expect to make any contributions in 2024, 2025 or 2026. We continually monitor financial market volatility and its impact on our retirement plans and other postretirement benefits, but we believe our liability driven investment strategy helps to minimize the impact of market volatility on our plan s funded status. For instance, our pension plan s funded status, as measured for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP purposes, was 102 funded as of December 31, 2023, and our postretirement benefit plans were 162 funded, as measured for GAAP purposes at December 31, 2023. See Note 5 for additional details. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Pinnacle West s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was 1,469 million in 2024, compared to 1,236 million in 2023, an increase of 233 million, primarily related to increased capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the BCE Sale and lower BCE investment activity. The difference between APS s and Pinnacle West s net cash used for investing activities primarily relates to the BCE Sale. See Note 16 for additional details.

 The table above does not include capital expenditures related to PNW Power projects. 
 
 Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various additions and improvements to APS s clean resources, including nuclear plants, renewables and ESS, as well as additions and improvements to existing fossil plants. We are monitoring the status of environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require modification to our planned environmental expenditures. 
 
 Distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades, capital replacements, and new customer construction. Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines, substations, and line extensions to new residential and commercial developments. 
 
 Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity 
 
 Nine -month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with nine -month period ended September 30, 2023. Pinnacle West s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was 343 million in 2024, compared to 412 million in 2023, a decrease of 69 million in net cash provided, primarily due to 642 million higher long-term debt repayments and a net decrease in short-term debt borrowings of 42 million, partially offset by 624 million in higher issuances of long-term debt. 
 
 98 

Table of Contents 

 APS s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was 403 million in 2024, compared to 347 million in 202 3, an increase of 56 million in net cash provided, primarily due to 300 million higher equity infusion and a net increase in short-term borrowings of 62 million, partially offset by 250 million higher long-term debt repayments and 50 million in lower issuances of long-term debt. 
 
 Significant Financing Activities. On October 23, 2024, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.895 per share of common stock, payable on December 2, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 4, 2024. This represents an increase in the indicated annual dividend from 3.52 per share to 3.58 per share. 
 
 On June 12, 2024, Pinnacle West contributed 450 million into APS in the form of an equity infusion. APS used this contribution to repay short-term indebtedness. 
 
 Available Credit Facilities . Pinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for their commercial paper programs, to finance indebtedness, and other general corporate purposes. See Note 3 for more information on available credit facilities. 
 
 Equity Forward Sale Agreements. On February 28, 2024, Pinnacle West entered into various equity forward sale agreements (the Equity Forward Sale Agreements ), which, at the option of Pinnacle West, may be settled in shares of Pinnacle West common stock with physical or net settlement or with cash settlement. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the Equity Forward Sale Agreements with physical delivery of 11,240,601 shares of common stock to the counterparties in exchange for cash of 725 million. See Note 10 for more information on the Equity Forward Sale agreements. 
 
 Other Financing Matters. See Note 7 for information related to the change in our margin and collateral accounts. 
 
 Debt Provisions 
 
 Pinnacle West s and APS s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants. For both Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65 . At September 30, 2024, the ratio was approximately 60 for Pinnacle West and 50 for APS. Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt. See further discussion of cross-default provisions below. 
 
 Neither Pinnacle West s nor APS s financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade. However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings. 
 
 All of Pinnacle West s loan agreements contain cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS s bank agreements contain cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements. Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings.

 Credit Ratings 
 
 The ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of October 25, 2024, are shown below. We are disclosing these credit ratings to enhance understanding of our cost of short-term and long-term capital and our ability to access the markets for liquidity and long-term debt. The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained. There is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West s or APS s securities and/or result in an increase in the cost of, or limit access to, capital. Such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments, insurance policies, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy-related contracts. On March 7, 2024, S P affirmed the ratings and revised the Company s and APS s outlooks from negative to stable. On March 20, 2024, Moody s downgraded both the Company s and APS s credit ratings by a notch and revised their outlooks from negative to stable. On March 26, 2024, Fitch affirmed APS s ratings and downgraded the Company s ratings by a notch. Fitch revised the outlook for both the Company and APS from negative to stable. At this time, we believe we have sufficient available liquidity resources to respond to a potential downward revision to our credit ratings.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our 2023 Form 10-K. See Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K for further details about our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS 
 
 Market Risks 
 
 Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trusts, other special use funds and benefit plan assets. 
 
 Interest Rate and Equity Risk 
 
 We have exposure to changing interest rates. Changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds (see Notes 11 and 12), and benefit plan assets. The nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of their equity and other non-fixed income investments. Nuclear decommissioning, coal reclamation, and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices.

Table of Contents 

 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas. Our risk management committee, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies. We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps. As part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities. 
 
 The following table shows the net pretax changes in mark-to-market of our energy derivative positions (dollars in millions):
