Warrants Associated with the December 2020 and April 2022 Public Offerings The outstanding warrants associated with the December 2020 public offering contains a provision where the warrant holder has the option to receive cash, equal to the Black-Scholes fair value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant, as cash settlement in the event that there is a fundamental transaction (contractually defined to include various merger, acquisition or stock transfer activities). Due to this provision, ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, requires that these warrants be classified as liabilities. The fair values of these warrants have been determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the changes in the fair value are recorded in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The outstanding warrants associated with the April 2022 public offering meet the definition of a derivative pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and do not meet the derivative scope exception given the warrants do not qualify under the indexation guidance. As a result, the April 2022 public offering warrants were initially recognized as liabilities and measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized gains of and million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, recognized a gain of million and a loss of million, respectively, on the warrant liabilities fair value adjustment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the warrant liabilities was million and million, respectively.

The 2024 Plan is the successor to the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan terminated on February 11, 2024 and no new grants may be made under the 2014 Plan after that date, although all outstanding awards granted under the 2014 Plan will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in the agreements evidencing such awards and the terms of the 2014 Plan. The purpose of the 2024 Plan is to allow the Company to utilize equity incentives in order to secure and retain the services of the Company's employees, directors, and consultants, and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of the Company's employees, directors, and consultants with the interests of the Company's stockholders. The aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued under the 2024 Plan will not exceed the sum of (i) new shares, plus (ii) certain shares subject to outstanding awards granted under the 2014 Plan that may become available for grant under the 2024 Plan as such shares become available from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2024 Plan.

Total liabilities 

The Company measures cash equivalents at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of cash equivalents is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. As of September 30, 2024, the cash and cash equivalents of million and the restricted cash balances of million and million within short and long term on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively, sum to the total of million as shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the warrant liabilities for which there is no current market such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value the Level 3 warrant liabilities at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This model incorporates transaction details such as the Company s stock price, contractual terms, maturity, risk free rates, as well as volatility. The unobservable input for all of the Level 3 warrant liabilities includes volatility. The historical and implied volatility of the Company, using its closing common stock prices and market data, is utilized to reflect future volatility over the expected term of the warrants. At September 30, 2024, the Level 3 volatility utilized in the Black-Scholes model to fair value the warrant liability was . At December 31, 2023, the range and weighted average of the Level 3 volatilities utilized in the Black-Scholes model to fair value the warrant liabilities were to and , respectively. The Company uses the binomial lattice valuation model to value the Level 3 derivative liabilities at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This model incorporates transaction details such as the Company s stock price, contractual terms, dividend yield, risk-free rate, adjusted equity volatility, credit rating, market credit spread, and estimated effective yield. The unobservable inputs associated with the Level 3 derivative liabilities are adjusted equity volatility, market credit spread, and

, basis points, and , respectively. The senior convertible notes are initially fair valued using the binomial lattice model and with the straight debt fair value calculated using the discounted cash flow method. The residual difference represents the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities and the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities are reassessed using the binomial lattice valuation model on a quarterly basis.

License Agreement with GSK On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into the GSK License Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the GSK License Agreement, the Company granted GSK an exclusive (even as to the Company and its affiliates), royalty-bearing, sublicensable license for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of ibrexafungerp, including the approved product BREXAFEMME, for all indications, in all countries other than Greater China and certain other countries already licensed to third parties (the GSK Territory ). If the existing licenses granted to or agreements with third parties are terminated with respect to any country, GSK will have an exclusive first right to negotiate with the Company to add those additional countries to the GSK Territory. The parties closed the transactions contemplated by the GSK License Agreement in May 2023. As previously disclosed, the Company became aware that a non-antibacterial beta-lactam drug substance was manufactured using equipment common to the manufacturing process for ibrexafungerp. Current FDA draft guidance recommends segregating the manufacture of non-antibacterial beta-lactam compounds from other compounds since beta-lactam compounds have the potential to act as sensitizing agents that may trigger hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction in some people. In the absence of the recommended segregation, there is a risk of cross contamination. It is not known whether any ibrexafungerp has been contaminated with a beta-lactam compound. Nonetheless, in light of this risk and out of an abundance of caution, BREXAFEMME (ibrexafungerp tablets) was recalled from the market and clinical studies of ibrexafungerp were placed on temporary hold. On December 26, 2023, the Company and GSK entered into a binding memorandum of understanding ("Binding MOU") for amendment to the GSK License Agreement. The GSK License Agreement was amended in connection with the delay in the commercialization of BREXAFEMME and further clinical development of ibrexafungerp associated with this event. Under the terms of the updated GSK License Agreement, as amended by Binding MOU, the Company is now eligible to receive potential: regulatory approval milestone payments of up to million (revised from up to million as provided in the GSK License Agreement); commercial milestone payments of up to million based on first commercial sale in invasive candidiasis (U.S./EU) (revised from up to million as provided in the GSK License Agreement); and and sales milestone payments of up to / / million (depending on the date of GSK s relaunch of BREXAFEMME in the U.S.) (revised from up to million as provided in the GSK License Agreement). These milestones are based on annual net sales in the GSK Territory, with a total of / / million to be paid upon achievement of multiple sales thresholds up through 200 million; a total of / / million to be paid upon achievement of multiple sales thresholds between 300 million and 500 million; and / / million to be paid at each sales threshold of 750 million and 1 billion. The Company will continue to be responsible for the execution and costs of the ongoing clinical studies of ibrexafungerp but will have the potential to receive up to million in development milestones (revised from up to million as provided in the GSK License Agreement), which comprise: million already paid; million already paid for the delivery to GSK of final clinical study reports for the completed FURI, CARES, and NATURE clinical studies; up to million for the achievement of two interim milestones associated with the Company's resumption and continued performance of the MARIO Study after the clinical hold is lifted; and million for the successful completion of the MARIO Study. In the case of each of the above milestones, such milestone events are defined in the GSK License Agreement, as amended by the Binding MOU. GSK will also pay royalties based on cumulative annual sales to us in the mid-single digit to mid-teen range. The royalty terms are not amended by the Binding MOU. The Company evaluated the GSK License Agreement in accordance with ASC 606 as it includes a customer-vendor relationship as defined under ASC 606 and meets the criteria to be considered a contract. The Company assessed the terms of the GSK License Agreement and identified the following performance obligations which include: (1) the license for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of ibrexafungerp, including the approved product BREXAFEMME, in the GSK Territory, (2) the research and development activities for the MARIO study, and (3) performance obligations for the remaining research and development activities for the ongoing clinical and preclinical studies of ibrexafungerp. As of June 30, 2023, the Company provided all necessary information to GSK for it to benefit from the license under the license term.

million in license revenue at a point in time upon the transfer of the license to GSK and completion of the initial technology transfer. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company maintains a contract asset of million and million, respectively, which is associated with the success-based milestones associated with the ongoing clinical studies of ibrexafungerp. In July 2024, the Company delivered to GSK the final clinical study reports for the completed FURI, CARES, and NATURE clinical studies, and the Company billed and received a million development milestone from GSK in the third quarter of 2024. The Company believes that the remaining million contract asset as of September 30, 2024 is collectible given the Company's probability assessment of achieving the milestone as defined in the GSK License Agreement, ongoing development activities, and other information available to the Company. The Company reassessed the transaction price as of September 30, 2024, including estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and the remaining milestones continued to be constrained. The Company recognizes the revenue associated with the MARIO study and the remaining ongoing clinical and preclinical studies of ibrexafungerp over time using an input method. The input method is based on the actual costs incurred as a percentage of total budgeted costs towards satisfying the performance obligation as this method provides the most faithful depiction of the Company s performance in transferring control of the services promised to GSK and represents the Company s best estimate of the period of the obligation. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million and million of license agreement revenue, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there is million and million of current and long-term deferred revenue, respectively, which is expected to be recognized by the end of 2025. License Agreement with Hansoh In February 2021, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement (the Hansoh Agreement with Hansoh (Shanghai) Health Technology Co., Ltd., and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company Limited (collectively, Hansoh ), pursuant to which the Company granted to Hansoh an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in the Greater China region, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (the Territory ). The Company also granted to Hansoh a non-exclusive license to manufacture ibrexafungerp solely for development and commercialization in the Territory. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was license agreement revenue recognized associated with the Hansoh Agreement given the variable consideration was fully constrained as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Overview 
 SCYNEXIS, Inc. is pioneering innovative medicines to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant infections. We are developing our proprietary antifungal platform fungerps , a novel class of antifungal agents called triterpenoids, that are a structurally distinct glucan synthase inhibitors and have generally shown in vitro and in vivo activity against a broad range of human fungal pathogens such as Candida and Aspergillus genera, including multidrug-resistant strains, as well as Pneumocystis , Coccidioides , Histoplasma and Blastomyces genera and in vivo activity against most common mucorales species. 
 Ibrexafungerp is the first representative of this novel class of antifungals. In June 2021 and December 2022, we announced that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BREXAFEMME (ibrexafungerp tablets) for treatment of patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), also known as vaginal yeast infection, and for the reduction in the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), respectively. Oral ibrexafungerp is also under development for other systemic fungal diseases. SCY-247, a second-generation antifungal compound from this novel class, is in preclinical development stage. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1 study for SCY-247 in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The FDA has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations to ibrexafungerp for the indications of VVC (including the prevention of recurrent VVC), invasive candidiasis (IC) (including candidemia), and invasive aspergillosis (IA), and has granted Orphan Drug designations for the IC and IA indications. The European Medicines Agency has granted Orphan Medicinal Product designation to ibrexafungerp for IC. We anticipate that the FDA may grant QIDP and Fast Track designations for the IV and oral formulations of SCY-247. These designations may provide us with additional market exclusivity and expedited regulatory paths. 
 In March 2023, we entered into a license agreement (the GSK License Agreement) with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property (No. 3) Limited (GSK) in which we granted GSK an exclusive (even as to us and our affiliates), royalty-bearing, sublicensable license for the development and commercialization of ibrexafungerp, including the approved product BREXAFEMME, for all indications, in all countries other than Greater China and certain other countries already licensed to third parties. In July 2024, we delivered to GSK the final clinical study reports for the completed FURI, CARES, and NATURE clinical studies and we received a 10.0 million development milestone in the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have received 125.0 million in upfront and development milestones under the GSK License Agreement. See further details of the GSK License Agreement, including financial terms, as described in Note 11 of Item 1 on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Product Recall and Clinical Hold 
 Following a review by GSK of the manufacturing process and equipment at the vendor that manufactures the ibrexafungerp drug substance, we became aware that a non-antibacterial beta-lactam drug substance was manufactured using equipment common to the manufacturing process for ibrexafungerp. Current FDA draft guidance recommends segregating the manufacture of non-antibacterial beta-lactam compounds from other compounds since beta-lactam compounds have the potential to act as sensitizing agents that may trigger hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction in some people. In the absence of the recommended segregation, there is a risk of cross contamination. It is not known whether any ibrexafungerp has been contaminated with a beta-lactam compound and we have not received any reports of adverse events due to the possible

Table of Contents 

beta-lactam cross contamination. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution and in line with GSK s recommendation, we have recalled BREXAFEMME (ibrexafungerp tablets) from the market and placed a temporary hold on clinical studies of ibrexafungerp, including the Phase 3 MARIO study. 
 The patient-level and clinical product recall is ongoing and we are working with an experienced vendor to manage the process. In September 2023, after we announced our voluntary clinical hold, the FDA concurred with our voluntary hold and placed a clinical hold. We are working with the FDA to discuss paths for resolution of this issue. The clinical hold and recall affected two ongoing clinical studies: the Phase 3 MARIO study and a Phase 1 lactation study. The clinical hold does not impact the completed FURI, CARES, VANQUISH and SCYNERGIA clinical studies. The NATURE study, which is an observational study in patients with IC treated with standard of care antifungals (not ibrexafungerp), is also not affected by this hold. The FDA determined that the compassionate use program for ibrexafungerp, which provides ibrexafungerp to patients with limited or no other treatment options, can continue provided the patient s treating physician concludes a favorable benefit-risk assessment and the patient is made aware of and consents to the risk. This applies to patients currently in the program as well as for new patients, pending confirmation of available supply. Our preclinical stage compound, SCY-247, is not affected by these developments. 
 In response to the hold on clinical studies of ibrexafungerp by the FDA due to possible beta-lactam cross contamination, we have entered into certain new manufacturing agreements with third-party contract manufacturers to begin producing new batches of ibrexafungerp which we believe will allow us to lift the clinical hold and restart our impacted clinical studies, the Phase 3 MARIO study and a Phase 1 lactation study. We are working on the resolution of this issue and we anticipate the restart of the MARIO study, after FDA's lifting of the clinical hold, in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 On November 7, 2023, a securities class action was filed by Brian Feldman against us and certain of our executives in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, alleging that, during the period from March 31, 2023 to September 22, 2023, we made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operations, and prospects, alleging specifically that we failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the equipment used to manufacture ibrexafungerp was also used to manufacture a non-antibacterial beta-lactam drug substance, presenting a risk of cross-contamination; (2) that we did not have effective internal controls and procedures, as well as adequate internal oversight policies to ensure that its vendor complied with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP); (3) that, due to the substantial risk of cross-contamination, we were reasonably likely to recall its ibrexafungerp tablets and halt its clinical studies; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, our statements about our business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, fees and costs on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased and/or acquired shares of our common stock between March 31, 2023 to September 22, 2023. On May 1, 2024, and again on June 4, 2024, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey. The complaints name our directors and certain of our officers and assert state and federal claims based on the same alleged misstatements as the securities class action complaint. We disagree with the allegations and intend to defend these litigations vigorously . 
 Repaid Loan Agreement 
 We, Hercules Capital, Inc. (Hercules Capital) and Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. (now a division of First Citizens Bank, SVB) were parties to a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of May 13, 2021 (the Loan Agreement), pursuant to which Hercules Capital, SVB and each of the other lenders from time-to-time party to the Loan Agreement (collectively, the Lenders) loaned to us 35 million. In connection with the entering into of the License Agreement, we entered into a First Amendment and Consent to Loan and Security Agreement with the Lenders pursuant to which the Lenders consented to us entering into the License Agreement and we agreed to pay to the Lenders an amount equal to the sum of (i) all outstanding principal plus all accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the amounts loaned under the Loan Agreement (approximately 35.4 million), (ii) the prepayment fee payable under Loan Agreement 262,500), (iii) the final payment payable under Loan Agreement 1,382,500), and (iv) all other sums, if any, that shall have become due and payable with respect to loan advances under the Loan Agreement. These payments became due upon the earliest of (A) one business day following receipt by us of the 90 million upfront payment payable to us under the License Agreement, (B) June 1, 2023, or (C) the termination of the License Agreement. 
 Following the closing of the transactions under the GSK License Agreement, in May 2023, we received the upfront payment pursuant to the terms of the GSK License Agreement, which triggered the obligation of us to repay the amounts due under the terms of the First Amendment. In connection with the repayment of those amounts due, in May 2023, we and the Lenders executed a payoff letter confirming the amounts due under the First Amendment, and our confirmation that the Loan Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, was terminated.

Liquidity 
 We have operated as a public entity since we completed our initial public offering in May 2014, which we refer to as our IPO. We also completed a follow-on public offering of our common stock in April 2015 and public offerings of our common stock and warrants in June 2016, March 2018, December 2019, December 2020, and April 2022. Our principal source of liquidity is cash, cash equivalents, and investments which totaled 84.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 372.1 million. We expect we will continue to incur significant research and development expense as we continue to execute our research and drug development strategy. Consistent with our operating plan, we also expect that we will continue to incur significant selling, general and administrative expenses to support our public reporting company operations and ongoing operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more of equity offerings, debt financings, other non-dilutive third-party funding (e.g., grants), strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements. We may offer shares of our common stock pursuant to our effective shelf registration statements. 
 Collaborations and Licensing Agreements 
 We are party to a number of licensing and collaboration agreements with partners in human health, including: (1) GSK, a pharmaceutical company, which we exclusively (even as to us and our affiliates) provide a, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of ibrexafungerp, including the approved product BREXAFEMME, for all indications, in the GSK Territory; (2) Merck, a pharmaceutical company, under which we exclusively licensed the rights to ibrexafungerp in the field of human health, and agreed to pay Merck milestones upon the occurrence of specified events as well as tiered royalties based on worldwide sales of ibrexafungerp when and if it is approved (in 2014, Merck assigned to us the patents related to ibrexafungerp that it had exclusively licensed to us and, as contemplated by the agreement, we will continue to pay milestones and royalties); (3) Hansoh, a pharmaceutical company, which we exclusively provide a license from us to research, develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in the Greater China region, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, under which we are entitled to receive development and commercial milestones and royalties; (4) R-Pharm, CJSC, or "R-Pharm," a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, granting it exclusive rights in the field of human health to develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in Russia and several non-core markets, under which we are entitled to receive potential milestones and royalties and reimbursement for certain development costs incurred by us (this agreement is not material to our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, or statements of cash flows); (5) Waterstone, an international pharmaceutical business, granting Waterstone exclusive worldwide rights to development and commercialization of SCY-635 for the treatment of viral diseases in humans, under which we are entitled to receive potential milestones and royalties; and (6) Cypralis Limited, or "Cypralis," a life sciences company, transferring to it certain cyclophilin inhibitor assets of ours, under which we are eligible to receive milestone payments upon the successful progression of certain Cypralis clinical candidates into later stage clinical studies and royalties payable upon product commercialization. 
 Components of Operating Results 
 Revenue 
 Revenue consists of license agreement revenue associated with GSK and product sales of BREXAFEMME. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our product (loss) revenue, net comprised of sales of BREXAFEMME that we sold as principal given we control BREXAFEMME product until delivery to our wholesalers at which point control is transferred. 
 Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue consists primarily of distribution, freight expenses, royalties due to Merck, and other manufacturing costs associated with BREXAFEMME. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover, develop, or improve potential product candidates we seek to develop. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing and other development efforts, and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of: 
 costs related to executing preclinical and clinical trials, including development milestones, drug formulation, manufacturing and other development; 

salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits and any stock-based compensation, for personnel in research and development functions; 

20 

Table of Contents 

fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product candidate development and intellectual property protection; 

medical affairs related expense and salary that is incurred to discover, develop, or improve potential product candidates; 

other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our products; and 

allocated overhead. 

Ibrexafungerp and SCY-247 were the only key research and development project during the periods presented. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expense for the foreseeable future as we continue our effort to develop ibrexafungerp and SCY-247, and to potentially develop our other product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding. 
 The successful development of product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources, business development, medical affairs, marketing and commercial, and administrative support functions. Other expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and legal services, consulting costs for general and administrative purposes, information systems and marketing efforts. 
 Other Expense (Income) 
 All of our other expense (income) recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, interest income, interest expense, the warrant liabilities fair value adjustment, and the derivative liabilities fair value adjustment. 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax (benefit) expense recognized consists primarily of a (benefit) expense for U.S. federal income tax.

Revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue primarily consists of 0.7 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in license agreement revenue associated with the GSK License Agreement. 
 Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consists primarily of distribution, freight, and royalty costs associated with BREXAFEMME. 
 Research and Development. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased to 8.1 million compared to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.6 million, or 25 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by an increase of 2.2 million in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expense, an increase of 0.9 million in preclinical expense, and a net increase in other research and development expense of 0.4 million, offset in part by a decrease of 1.6 million in clinical expense and a decrease of 0.3 million in salaries primarily associated with medical affairs. 
 The 2.2 million increase in CMC expense is primarily associated with a 2.1 million increase in expense associated with the manufacturing of drug product for SCY-247 and ibrexafungerp. The 0.9 million increase in preclinical expense was primarily associated with certain preclinical costs associated with the continued development of SCY-247. The 1.6 million decrease in clinical expense was primarily due to a 1.4 million decrease in clinical expense for the Phase 3 MARIO study and a 0.2 million decrease in clinical expense associated with the Phase 1 lactation study. 
 Selling, General Administrative . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 2.9 million from 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2.1 million, or 42 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease of 1.5 million in professional fees and a decrease of 0.5 million in commercial expense due to the costs incurred in the prior period associated with BREXAFEMME. The 1.5 million decrease in professional fees was primarily due to a 0.8 million nonrecurring legal expense incurred in the prior period. 
 Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs and Discount . For both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0.4 million in amortization of debt issuance costs and discount. The debt issuance costs and discount for our March 2019 convertible notes primarily consisted of an allocated portion of advisory fees and other issuance costs and the initial fair value of the derivative liability. 
 Interest Income . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.0 million and 1.3 million, respectively, in interest income on our money market funds and investments. 
 Interest Expense . For both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0.2 million in interest expense on our March 2019 convertible notes. 
 Warrant Liabilities Fair Value Adjustment . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of 6.8 million and 7.5 million, respectively, in the fair value adjustment related to the warrant liabilities primarily due to the decrease in our stock price during the periods. 
 Derivative Liabilities Fair Value Adjustment. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of 0.2 million in the fair value adjustment related to the derivative liability primarily due to the decrease in our stock price during the period. 
 Income Tax Benefit . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 0.4 million income tax benefit for U.S. federal income tax.

Revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue consists of the 2.8 million in license agreement revenue associated with the GSK License Agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue primarily consists of the 130.1 million recognized upon the transfer of the license associated with the GSK License Agreement in May 2023. 
 Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consists primarily of distribution, freight, and royalty costs associated with BREXAFEMME. 
 Research and Development. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased to 22.1 million compared to 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.7 million, or 9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by an increase of 4.4 million in CMC expense and an increase of 1.8 million in preclinical expense, offset in part by a decrease of 3.5 million in clinical expense and a decrease of 1.0 million in salaries primarily associated with medical affairs. 
 The 4.4 million increase in CMC expense is primarily associated with a 1.5 million expense for drug product purchased in the current period and a 2.6 million increase in expense associated with the manufacturing of drug product for SCY-247 and ibrexafungerp. The 1.8 million increase in preclinical expense was primarily associated with certain preclinical costs associated with the continued development of SCY-247. The 3.5 million decrease in clinical expense was primarily due to a 2.2 million decrease in clinical expense for the Phase 3 MARIO study, a 0.8 million decrease in expense associated with a Phase 1 study of oral ibrexafungerp that was substantially completed in the prior period and is intended to support the potential NDA filing for the treatment of IC, and a 0.6 million decrease in clinical expense associated with the Phase 1 lactation study. 
 Selling, General Administrative . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 9.7 million from 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 7.6 million, or 44 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease of 5.7 million in professional fees, a decrease of 1.2 million in commercial expense due to the costs incurred in the prior period associated with BREXAFEMME, and a net decrease of 0.7 million in other selling, general, and administrative expense. The 5.7 million decrease in professional fees was primarily due to a 3.1 million expense incurred during the prior period for business development associated with the GSK License Agreement, a 0.8 million nonrecurring legal expense incurred in the prior period, a 0.7 million decrease in legal costs associated with the GSK License Agreement, and a 0.5 million expense recognized in the prior period to write off a deferred asset for certain commitment fees associated with the Loan Agreement. 
 Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs and Discount . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.3 million and 2.6 million in amortization of debt issuance costs and discount. The decrease of 1.4 million, or 
 23 

Table of Contents 

52 , was primarily driven by the recognition, in the prior period, of 2.0 million in amortization for the remaining debt issuance costs and discount associated with the Loan Agreement which was fully paid in May 2023. The debt issuance costs and discount for our March 2019 convertible notes primarily consisted of an allocated portion of advisory fees and other issuance costs and the initial fair value of the derivative liability. 
 Interest Income . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 3.4 million and 2.6 million in interest income, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the interest income being earned on our money market funds and investments for the full period in 2024. 
 Interest Expense . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0.6 million and 2.9 million in interest expense, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the repayment of the Loan Agreement in May 2023. 
 Warrant Liabilities Fair Value Adjustment . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a gain of 10.6 million and a loss of 6.0 million, respectively, in the fair value adjustment related to the warrant liabilities primarily due to the decrease and increase in our stock price during the periods, respectively. 
 Derivative Liabilities Fair Value Adjustment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a gain of 0.2 million and a loss of 0.2 million, respectively, in the fair value adjustment related to the derivative liabilities primarily due to the decrease and increase in our stock price during the periods, respectively. 
 Income Tax Expense . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 0.1 million income tax expense for U.S. federal income tax. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of 84.9 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 98.0 million as of December 31, 2023. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to fund our on-going operations for a period of at least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 372.1 million. 
 Consistent with our operating plan, we expect to incur significant research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result of our continued significant expenses, we may need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more of equity offerings, debt financings, or other non-dilutive third-party funding, strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth the significant sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Operating Activities 
 The 82.0 million decrease in net cash (used in) provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the 115.0 million in upfront and development milestones received under the GSK License Agreement in the prior period and the continued development costs associated with SCY-247 and ibrexafungerp in the current period, offset in part by the 10.0 million development milestone received under the GSK License Agreement in the current period. 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisted of the 16.9 million net loss adjusted for non-cash charges that included the gain on change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of 10.6 million, stock-based compensation expense of 2.4 million, and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount of 1.3 million, partially offset by a net favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of 10.8 million. The net favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of 10.8 million is due to a favorable change of 16.2 million due to the 
 24 

Table of Contents 

decrease in operating assets, offset by an unfavorable change of 5.4 million due to the decrease in operating liabilities The net 16.2 million decrease in operating assets is primarily due to a decrease of 9.9 million in the license agreement contract asset given the receipt of the 10.0 million development milestone associated with the GSK License Agreement in the current period, a 2.3 million decrease in the license agreement receivable associated with the GSK License Agreement which was collected in the current period, and a 4.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses, other assets, deferred costs, and other. The 4.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses, other assets, deferred costs, and other was primarily due to the collection of a 4.4 million unbilled receivable in the current period from GSK. The net unfavorable change of 5.4 million in operating liabilities is primarily due to the 2.2 million decrease in accounts payable and a 2.0 million decrease in accrued expenses primarily due to the 1.0 million decrease in accrued research and development expenses. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 67.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisted of the 86.6 million net income adjusted for non-cash charges that included the loss on change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of 6.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of 2.1 million, and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount of 2.6 million, partially offset by a net unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of 30.3 million. The net unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities was due to a net decrease in operating liabilities of 0.4 million and by a net increase of 30.0 million in operating assets. The net 30.0 million increase in operating assets is primarily due to a 19.3 million increase in license agreement contract asset associated with the GSK License Agreement, a 7.4 million increase in inventory for raw material purchased in the current period, and an increase in accounts receivable and license agreement receivable of 2.5 million. The 0.4 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, other liabilities, and other was primarily due to the decrease of 5.8 million in other liabilities associated with the deferred fees due to Amplity that were fully paid as of February 2023 and a decrease of 2.5 million in accounts payable, offset primarily by a 4.1 million increase in deferred revenue associated with the GSK License Agreement and a 3.9 million increase in accrued expenses due to the 3.5 million increase in expense for product recall. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of purchases and maturities of investments of 28.0 million and 36.8 million, respectively. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of purchases and maturities of investments of 73.3 million and 40.6 million, respectively. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 16,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted primarily of the proceeds from employee stock purchase plan issuances. 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 36.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted primarily of the full repayment of the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB in May 2023. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We expect to incur expenses in connection with our efforts to further development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, product candidates. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing future operations. 
 We are continually evaluating our operating plan and assessing the optimal cash utilization for our SCY-247 and ibrexafungerp development strategy. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses necessary to complete the development of product candidates. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 our ability to successfully achieve the development, regulatory, and commercial milestones under our GSK License Agreement; 

the progress, and costs, of the clinical development of SCY-247 and ibrexafungerp; 

the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and any other regulatory approvals; 

the ability of product candidates to progress through clinical development successfully; 

our need to expand our research and development activities; 

the costs associated with securing, establishing and maintaining commercialization and manufacturing capabilities; 

25 

Table of Contents 

our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; 

our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel; 

our need to implement additional, as well as to enhance existing, internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting processes and systems and the associated compliance costs; and 

the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of net proceeds from equity offerings, debt financings, or other non-dilutive third-party funding (e.g., grants), strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, in particular the GSK License Agreement. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, similar to our Loan Agreement or the convertible senior notes we sold in March 2019 and April 2020, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through sales of assets, other third-party funding, strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 Significant Estimates and Judgments 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our critical estimates and judgments are described within Item 7 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosure about Market Risk. 
 This item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 
 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1.	Leg al Proceedings. 
 On November 7, 2023, a securities class action was filed by Brian Feldman against us and certain of our executives in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, alleging that, during the period from March 31, 2023 to September 22, 2023, we made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operations, and prospects, alleging specifically that we failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the equipment used to manufacture ibrexafungerp was also used to manufacture a non-antibacterial beta-lactam drug substance, presenting a risk of cross-contamination; (2) that we did not have effective internal controls and procedures, as well as adequate internal oversight policies to ensure that its vendor complied with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP); (3) that, due to the substantial risk of cross-contamination, we were reasonably likely to recall its ibrexafungerp tablets and halt its clinical studies; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, our statements about our business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, fees and costs on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased and/or acquired shares of our common stock between March 31, 2023 to September 22, 2023. On May 1, 2024, and again on June 4, 2024, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey. The complaints name our directors and certain of our officers and assert state and federal claims based on the same alleged misstatements as the securities class action complaint. We disagree with the allegations and intend to defend these litigations vigorously . 
 Item 1A.	Ri sk Factors. 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
