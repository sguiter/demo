 months. The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the net present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the Company s estimate of the fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. 
 In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company uses a number of sources, including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms. The Company also considers information and other factors including market conditions, the industry that the tenant operates in, characteristics of the real estate (e.g., location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates), tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business. Additionally, the Company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company uses the information obtained as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence as part of its consideration of the accounting

 or more tenant renewal options. The Company s leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments) and generally provide for increases in rent based on fixed contractual terms or as a result of increases in the Consumer Price Index. 
 Substantially all of the leases are triple-net, which means that the lessees are responsible for paying all property operating expenses, including maintenance, insurance, utilities, property taxes and, if applicable, ground rent expense; therefore, the Company is generally not responsible for repairs or other capital expenditures related to the properties while the triple-net leases are in effect and, at the end of the lease term, the lessees are responsible for returning the property to the Company in a substantially similar condition as when they took possession. Some of the Company s leases provide that in the event the Company wishes to sell the property

 Since lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the lessee, the preceding table presents future minimum base rental payments to be received during the initial non-cancelable lease term only. In addition, the future minimum lease payments exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be collected from certain tenants based on provisions related to performance thresholds and exclude increases in annual rent based on future changes in the Consumer Price Index, among other items.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company s ROU assets and lease liabilities were million and million, respectively. These amounts are included in rent receivables, prepaid expenses and other assets, net and accrued liabilities and other payables on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
 The discount rate applied to measure each ROU asset and lease liability is based on the Company s incremental borrowing rate ("IBR"). The Company considers the general economic environment and its historical borrowing activity and factors in various financing and asset specific adjustments to ensure the IBR is appropriate to the intended use of the underlying lease. As the Company did not elect to apply hindsight, lease term assumptions determined under ASC 840 were carried forward and applied in calculating the lease liabilities recorded under ASC 842. Certain of the Company s ground leases offer renewal options which it assesses against relevant economic factors to determine whether it is reasonably certain of exercising or not exercising the option.

 You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future events or of our performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes, except as required by law. 
 Because we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment, new risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can management assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

 Overview 
 We are an internally managed real estate company that acquires, owns and manages primarily single-tenant properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to middle-market companies operating service-oriented or experience-based businesses. We generally invest in and lease freestanding, single-tenant commercial real estate facilities where a tenant services its customers and conducts activities that are essential to the generation of the tenant s sales and profits. As of September 30, 2024, 93.2 of our 438.0 million of annualized base rent was attributable to properties operated by tenants in service-oriented and experience-based businesses. "Annualized base rent" means annualized contractually specified cash base rent in effect on September 30, 2024 for all of our leases (including those accounted for as loans or direct financing leases) commenced as of that date and annualized cash interest on our mortgage loans receivable as of that date. 
 We were organized on January 12, 2018 as a Maryland corporation. We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2018, and we believe that our current organization, operations and intended distributions will allow us to continue to so qualify. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EPRT . 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value by generating attractive risk-adjusted returns through owning, managing and growing a diversified portfolio of commercially desirable properties. As of September 30, 2024, we had a portfolio of 2,053 properties (inclusive of 149 properties which secure our investments in mortgage loans receivable) that was diversified by tenant, industry, concept and geography, had annualized base rent of 438.0 million and was 99.9 occupied. Our portfolio is built based on the following core investment attributes: 
 Diversification. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was 99.9 occupied by 407 tenants operating 583 different brands, or concepts, in 16 industries across 49 states, with none of our tenants contributing more than 4.3 of our annualized base rent. Our goal is that, over time, no more than 5 of our annualized base rent will be derived from any single tenant or more than 1 from any single property. 
 Long Lease Term. As of September 30, 2024, our leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 14.1 years (based on annualized base rent), with 3.9 of our annualized base rent attributable to leases expiring prior to January 1, 2029. Our properties generally are subject to long-term net leases that we believe provide us a stable base of revenue from which to grow our portfolio. 
 Significant Use of Sale-Leaseback Investments. We seek to acquire properties owned and operated by middle-market businesses and lease the properties back to the operators pursuant to our standard lease form. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 89 of our investments were sale-leaseback transactions. 
 Significant Use of Master Leases. As of September 30, 2024, 65.6 of our annualized base rent was attributable to master leases. 
 Contractual Base Rent Escalation. As of September 30, 2024, 98.6 of our leases (based on annualized base rent) provided for increases in future base rent at a weighted average rate of 1.7 per year. 
 Smaller, Low Basis Single-Tenant Properties. We generally invest in freestanding small-box single- tenant properties. As of September 30, 2024, our average investment per property was 2.7 million (which equals our aggregate investment in our properties (including transaction costs, lease incentives and amounts funded for 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 construction in progress) divided by the number of properties owned at such date), and we believe investments of similar size allow us to grow our portfolio without concentrating a large amount of capital in individual properties and limit our exposure to events that may adversely affect a particular property. Additionally, we believe that many of our properties are generally fungible and appropriate for multiple commercial uses, which reduces the risk that a particular property may become obsolete and enhances our ability to sell a property if we choose to do so. 
 
 Healthy Rent Coverage Ratio and Tenant Financial Reporting. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio s weighted average rent coverage ratio was 3.6x, and 99.0 of our leases (based on annualized base rent) obligate the tenant to periodically provide us with specified unit-level financial reporting. "Rent coverage ratio" means, as of a specified date, the ratio of (x) tenant-reported or, when unavailable, management's estimate (based on tenant-reported financial information) of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and cash rent attributable to the leased property (or properties, in the case of a master lease) to (y) the annualized base rental obligation. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from our competitors and allow us to compete effectively in the single-tenant, net-lease market: 
 Carefully Constructed Portfolio of Recently Acquired Properties Leased to Service-Oriented or Experience-Based Tenants. We have strategically constructed a portfolio that is diversified by tenant, industry, concept and geography and generally avoids exposure to businesses that we believe are subject to pressure from e-commerce. Our properties are generally subject to long-term net leases that we believe provide us with a stable and predictable base of revenue from which to grow our portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we had a portfolio of 2,053 properties, with annualized base rent of 438.0 million, which was purposefully selected by our management team in accordance with our focused and disciplined investment strategy. Our portfolio is diversified with 407 tenants operating 583 different concepts across 49 states and in 16 distinct industries. None of our tenants contributed more than 4.3 of our annualized base rent as of September 30, 2024, and our strategy targets a scaled portfolio that, over time, derives no more than 5 of our annualized base rent from any single tenant or more than 1 from any single property. 
 We focus on investing in properties leased to tenants operating in service-oriented or experience-based businesses such as car washes, restaurants (primarily quick service restaurants), early childhood education, medical and dental services, convenience stores, automotive services, equipment rental, entertainment and health and fitness, which we believe are generally more insulated from e-commerce pressure than many others. As of September 30, 2024, 93.2 of our annualized base rent was attributable to tenants operating service-oriented and experience-based businesses. 
 We believe that our portfolio s diversity and our rigorous underwriting decrease the impact on us of an adverse event affecting a specific tenant, industry or region, and our focus on leasing to tenants in industries that we believe are well-positioned to withstand competition from e-commerce businesses increases the stability and predictability of our rental revenue. 
 Differentiated Investment Strategy. We seek to acquire and lease freestanding, single-tenant commercial real estate facilities where a tenant services its customers and conducts activities at the property that are essential to the generation of its sales and profits. We primarily seek to invest in properties leased to unrated middle-market companies that we determine have attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories. We believe middle-market companies are underserved from a capital perspective and that we can offer them attractive real estate financing solutions while allowing us to enter into lease agreements that provide us with attractive risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, many net-lease transactions with middle-market companies involve properties that are individually relatively small, which allows us to avoid concentrating a large amount of capital in individual properties. We maintain close relationships with our tenants, which we believe allows us to source additional investments and become the capital provider of choice as our tenants businesses grow and their real estate needs increase.

 Disciplined Underwriting Leading to Strong Portfolio Characteristics. We generally seek to invest in single assets or portfolios of assets through transactions which range in aggregate purchase price from 2 million to 100 million. Our size allows us to focus on investing in a segment of the market that we believe is underserved from a capital perspective and where we can originate or acquire relatively smaller assets on attractive terms that provide meaningful growth to our portfolio. In addition, we seek to invest in commercially desirable properties that are suitable for use by different tenants, offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and possess characteristics that reduce our real estate investment risks. 
 Experienced and Proven Management Team. Our senior management has significant experience in the net-lease industry and a track record of growing net-lease businesses to significant scale. 
 Our senior management team has been responsible for our focused and disciplined investment strategy and for developing and implementing our investment sourcing, underwriting, closing and asset management infrastructure, which we believe can support significant investment growth without a proportionate increase in our operating expenses. As of September 30, 2024, exclusive of our initial investment in a portfolio of 262 net leased properties, consisting primarily of restaurants, that we acquired on June 16, 2016 as part of the liquidation of General Electric Capital Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of 279.8 million (including transaction costs) (the "Initial Portfolio"), 91.8 of our portfolio s annualized base rent was attributable to internally originated sale-leaseback transactions. The substantial experience, knowledge and relationships of our senior leadership team provide us with an extensive network of contacts that we believe allows us to originate attractive investment opportunities and effectively grow our business. 
 
 Scalable Platform Allows for Significant Growth. Building on our senior leadership team s experience in net-lease real estate investing, we have developed leading origination, underwriting, financing and property management capabilities. Our platform is scalable, and we seek to leverage our capabilities to improve our efficiency and processes to continue to seek attractive risk- adjusted growth. While we expect that our general and administrative expenses could increase as our portfolio grows, we expect that such expenses as a percentage of our portfolio and our revenues will decrease over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale. 
 Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting Supports Active Asset Management. We seek to enter into lease agreements that obligate our tenants to periodically provide us with corporate and/or unit-level financial reporting, which we believe enhances our ability to actively monitor our investments, manage credit risk, negotiate lease renewals and proactively manage our portfolio to protect stockholder value. As of September 30, 2024, leases contributing 99.0 of our annualized base rent required tenants to provide us with specified unit-level financial information, and leases contributing 99.0 of our annualized base rent required tenants to provide us with corporate-level financial reporting. 
 Our Business and Growth Strategies 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value by generating attractive risk-adjusted returns through owning, managing and growing a diversified portfolio of commercially desirable properties. We intend to pursue our objective through the following business and growth strategies. 
 Structure and Manage Our Diverse Portfolio with Focused and Disciplined Underwriting and Risk Management. We seek to maintain the stability of our rental revenue and maximize the long-term return on our investments while continuing our growth by using our focused and disciplined underwriting and risk management expertise. When underwriting assets, we focus on commercially desirable properties, with strong operating performance, healthy rent coverage ratios and tenants with attractive credit characteristics. 
 Leasing . In general, we seek to enter into leases with (i) relatively long terms (typically with initial terms of 15 years or more and tenant renewal options); (ii) attractive rent escalation provisions; (iii) healthy rent coverage ratios; and (iv) tenant obligations to periodically provide us with financial information, which provides us with information about the operating performance of the leased property and/or tenant and allows us to actively monitor the security of payments under the lease on an ongoing basis. We strongly prefer to use master lease structures, pursuant to which we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on a unitary (i.e., all or none basis. In addition, in the context of our sale-leaseback investments, we generally seek to establish contract rents that are at or below prevailing market rents, which we believe enhances tenant retention and reduces our releasing risk if a lease is rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding or expires.

Table of Contents 

 Diversification . We monitor and manage the diversification of our portfolio in order to reduce the risks associated with adverse developments affecting a particular tenant, property, industry or region. Our strategy targets a portfolio that, over time, will (1) derive no more than 5 of its annualized base rent from any single tenant or more than 1 of its annualized base rent from any single property, (2) be primarily leased to tenants operating in service-oriented or experience- based businesses and (3) avoid significant industry, concept or geographic concentration. While we consider these criteria when making investments, we may be opportunistic in managing our business and make investments that do not meet one or more of these criteria if we believe the opportunity presents an attractive risk-adjusted return. 
 Asset Management. We are an active asset manager and regularly review each of our properties to evaluate various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the business performance at the property, credit of the tenant and local real estate market conditions. Among other things, we use Moody s Analytics RiskCalc, which is a model for predicting private company defaults based on Moody s Analytics Credit Research Database, to proactively detect credit deterioration. Additionally, we monitor market rents relative to in-place rents and the amount of tenant capital expenditures in order to refine our tenant retention and alternative use assumptions. Our management team utilizes our internal credit diligence to monitor the credit profile of each of our tenants on an ongoing basis. We believe that this proactive approach enables us to identify and address issues in a timely manner and to determine whether there are properties in our portfolio that are appropriate for disposition. 
 In addition, as part of our active portfolio management, we may selectively dispose of assets that we conclude do not offer a return commensurate with the investment risk, contribute to unwanted geographic, industry or tenant concentrations, or may be sold at a price we determine is attractive. We believe that our underwriting processes and active asset management enhance the stability of our rental revenue by reducing default losses and increasing the likelihood of lease renewals. 
 Focus on Relationship-Based Sourcing to Grow Our Portfolio by Originating Sale-Leaseback Transactions. We plan to continue our disciplined growth by originating sale-leaseback transactions and opportunistically making acquisitions of properties subject to net leases that contribute to our portfolio s tenant, industry and geographic diversification. As of September 30, 2024, exclusive of the Initial Portfolio, 91.8 of our portfolio s annualized base rent was attributable to internally originated sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, we seek to leverage our relationships with our tenants to facilitate investment opportunities, including selectively agreeing to reimburse certain of our tenants for development costs at our properties in exchange for contractually specified rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding. We believe our senior management team s reputation, in-depth market knowledge and extensive network of longstanding relationships in the net lease industry provide us access to an ongoing pipeline of attractive investment opportunities. 
 Focus on Middle-Market Companies in Service-Oriented or Experience-Based Businesses. We primarily focus on investing in properties that we lease on a long-term, triple-net basis to middle- market companies that we determine have attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories. Properties leased to middle-market companies may offer us the opportunity to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns as a result of our extensive and disciplined credit and real estate analysis, lease structuring and portfolio composition. We believe our capital solutions are attractive to middle- market companies, as such companies often have limited financing options as compared to larger, credit rated organizations. We also believe that, in many cases, smaller transactions with middle- market companies will allow us to maintain and grow our portfolio s diversification. Middle-market companies are often willing to enter into leases with structures and terms that we consider attractive (such as master leases and leases that require ongoing tenant financial reporting) and believe contribute to the stability of our rental revenue. 
 In addition, we emphasize investments in properties leased to tenants engaged in service-oriented or experience-based businesses, such as car washes, restaurants (primarily quick service restaurants), early childhood education, medical and dental services, convenience stores, automotive services, equipment rental, entertainment and health and fitness, as we believe these businesses are generally more insulated from e-commerce pressure than many others. 
 Internal Growth Through Long-Term Triple-Net Leases That Provide for Periodic Rent Escalations. We seek to enter into long-term (typically with initial terms of 15 years or more and tenant renewal options), triple-net leases that provide for periodic contractual rent escalations. As of September 30, 2024, our leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 14.1 years (based on annualized base rent), with only 3.9 of our 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 annualized base rent attributable to leases expiring prior to January 1, 2029, and 98.6 of our leases (based on annualized base rent) provided for increases in future base rent at a weighted average of 1.7 per year. 
 Actively Manage Our Balance Sheet to Maximize Capital Efficiency. We seek to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity financing and to maintain funding sources that lock in long-term investment spreads and limit interest rate sensitivity. We target a level of net debt that, over time, is generally less than six times our annualized adjusted EBITDA re (as defined in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below). We seek to maintain access to multiple sources of debt capital, including the investment grade-rated unsecured bond market and bank debt, through our revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loan facilities.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the net investment value of our income property portfolio totaled 5.3 billion, consisting of investments in 2,053 properties (inclusive of 149 properties which secure our investments in mortgage loans receivable), with annualized base rent of 438.0 million. Substantially all of our cash from operations is generated by our investment portfolio. 
 The liquidity requirements for operating our Company consist primarily of funding our investment activities, servicing our outstanding indebtedness and paying our general and administrative expenses and dividends as declared by our board of directors. The occupancy level of our portfolio is high (99.9 as of September 30, 2024) and, because substantially all of our leases are triple-net (whereby our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance costs for operating the property, and insurance and property taxes associated with the leased properties), our liquidity requirements are not significantly impacted by property costs. When a property becomes vacant, we are required to pay the property costs not paid by a tenant, as well as those property costs accruing during the time it takes to locate a new tenant or to sell the property. As of September 30, 2024, three of our investment properties were vacant, significantly less than 1 of our portfolio, and all remaining properties were subject to a lease or mortgage loan receivable. We expect to incur property costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being marketed for lease or sale. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations. The amount of such property costs can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of property vacancies and the level of underperforming properties; however, we do not expect that such costs will be significant to our operations. 
 We intend to continue to grow through additional investments in stand-alone single tenant properties. To accomplish this objective, we seek to invest in real estate utilizing a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that we do not distribute to our stockholders. When we sell properties, we generally reinvest the cash proceeds from our sales in new single tenant properties. Our short-term liquidity requirements also include the funding needs associated with 103 properties where we have agreed to reimburse the tenant for certain development, construction, or renovation costs or to provide construction financing in exchange for contractual payments of interest or increased rent that generally increases in proportion with our level of funding. As of September 30, 2024, we agreed to provide construction financing or reimburse the tenant for certain development, construction and renovation costs in an aggregate amount of 621.7 million, and, as of such date, we have funded 415.1 million of this commitment. We expect to fund the remaining commitment totaling approximately 206.6 million by September 30, 2025.

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, as of October 18, 2024, we were under contract to acquire 13 properties with an aggregate purchase price of 31.5 million, subject to completion of our due diligence procedures and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including our construction financing and tenant reimbursement obligations and potential investment in future single tenant properties, primarily with our cash and cash equivalents, net cash from operating activities, issuance of common stock subject to outstanding forward purchase commitments, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and potentially through proceeds generated from asset sales and our 2024 ATM Program, under which we may issue common stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to 160.0 million as of October 18, 2024. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of the funds necessary to make additional investments and repay indebtedness. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including net cash from operating activities, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, future debt financings, proceeds from the sale of our common stock and proceeds from the sale of selected properties in our portfolio. However, at any point in time, there may be a number of factors that could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including unfavorable conditions in the overall equity and credit markets, our level of leverage, the portion of our portfolio that is unencumbered, our credit ratings, borrowing restrictions imposed by our existing debt agreements, general market conditions for real estate and potentially REITs specifically, our operating performance, our liquidity and general market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to access these various capital sources to fund our future investments and thereby grow our cash flows. 
 An additional liquidity need is funding the required level of distributions, generally 90 of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain), that are among the requirements for us to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Holders of OP Units are entitled to distributions per unit equivalent to those paid by us per share of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Board declared total cash distributions of 0.865 per share of common stock/OP Unit totaling 152.5 million and 51.1 million is payable as of September 30, 2024. To continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. As a result of this requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our business needs to the same extent as other entities that are not REITs. If we do not have sufficient funds available to us from our operations to fund our business needs, we will need to find alternative ways to fund those needs. Such alternatives may include, among other things, selling properties (whether or not the sales price is optimal or otherwise meets our strategic long-term objectives), incurring additional indebtedness or issuing equity securities in public or private transactions. The availability and attractiveness of the terms of these potential sources of financing cannot be assured. 
 Generally, our short-term debt capital needs are provided through the use of our Revolving Credit Facility. We manage our long-term leverage position through the issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt on an unsecured or secured basis. Generally, we will seek to issue long-term debt on an unsecured basis as we believe this facilitates greater flexibility in the management of our portfolio and our ability to retain optionality in our overall financing and growth strategy. By seeking to match the expected cash inflows from our long-term income producing investments with the expected cash outflows for our long-term debt, we seek to "lock in," for as long as is economically feasible, the expected positive spread between our scheduled cash inflows from our investments and the cash outflows on our debt obligations. In this way, we seek to reduce the risk that increases in interest rates would adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations. Our ability to execute leases that contain annual rent escalations also contributes to our ability to manage the risk of a rising interest rate environment. We use various financial instruments designed to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. Although we are not required to maintain a particular leverage ratio and may not be able to do so, we generally consider that, over time, a level of net debt (which includes recourse and non-recourse borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash available for future investment) that is less than six times our annualized adjusted EBITDA re is prudent for a real estate company like ours. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of our long-term debt was fixed-rate debt or was effectively converted to a fixed-rate for the term of the debt though hedging strategies, and our weighted average debt maturity was 4.3 years. As we continue to invest in real estate properties and grow our real estate portfolio, we intend to manage our long-term debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of our debt will mature in any single year in the future.

 Future sources of debt capital may include public issuances of senior unsecured notes, term loan borrowings, mortgage financing of a single-asset or a portfolio of assets and CMBS borrowings. These sources of debt capital may offer us the opportunity to lower our cost of funding and further diversify our sources of debt capital. Over time, we may choose to issue preferred equity as a part of our overall strategy for funding our business. As our outstanding debt matures, we may refinance it as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that the cash generated by our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, our borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, issuance of common stock subject to outstanding forward purchase commitments, and our potential access to additional sources of capital, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and allow us to invest in the real estate for which we currently have made commitments. 
 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which, unless otherwise specified, will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. At September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership had issued and outstanding 400.0 million of senior notes. The obligations of the Operating Partnership under the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company. The guarantee is full and unconditional, and the Operating Partnership is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company s consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is full and unconditional and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership have not been presented. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi), the Company has excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership as the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and not provide incremental value to investors.

 Revolving Credit Facility and Credit Facility Term Loans 
 Through our Operating Partnership, we are party to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a group of lenders, which was amended on July 11, 2024 (the "Credit Agreement") and provides for revolving loans of up to 600.0 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and an additional 1.3 billion of term loans, consisting of a 400.0 million term loan (the "2028 Term Loan"), a 450.0 million term loan (the 2029 Term Loan and a 450.0

Table of Contents 

 million term loan (the "2030 Term Loan" and, together with the 2028 Term Loan and 2029 Term Loan, the CF Term Loans ). All principal amounts available under the 2028 Term Loan were drawn in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. All principal amounts available under the 2029 Term Loan were drawn in the third and fourth quarters of 2023. All principal amounts available under the 2030 Term Loan were drawn in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility matures on February 10, 2026, with two extension options of six months each, exercisable by the Operating Partnership, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The 2028 Term Loan matures on January 25, 2028, the 2029 Term Loan has an original maturity of three years, plus extension options at the Operating Partnership's election, which can extend the maturity to February 24, 2029 and the 2030 Term Loan has an original maturity of three years, plus extension options at the Operating Partnership's election, which can extend the maturity to January 11, 2030. The loans under each of the Revolving Credit Facility and the CF Term Loans initially bear interest at an annual rate of applicable Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin (which applicable margin varies between the Revolving Credit Facility and the CF Term Loans). The Adjusted Term SOFR is a rate with a term equivalent to the interest period applicable to the relevant borrowing. In addition, the Operating Partnership is required to pay a revolving facility fee throughout the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin and the revolving facility fee rate are a spread and rate, as applicable, set according to the credit ratings provided by S P, Moody's and/or Fitch. 
 Each of the Revolving Credit Facility and the CF Term Loans is freely pre-payable at any time. Outstanding credit extensions under the Revolving Credit Facility are mandatorily payable if the amount of such credit extensions exceeds the revolving facility limit. The Operating Partnership may re-borrow amounts paid down on the Revolving Credit Facility prior to its maturity. Loans repaid under the CF Term Loans cannot be reborrowed. The Credit Agreement has an accordion feature to increase, subject to certain conditions, the maximum availability of credit (either through increased revolving commitments or additional term loans) by up to 500.0 million. 
 The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Credit Agreement, and we and certain of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own a direct or indirect interest in an eligible real property asset are guarantors under the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary restrictive financial and nonfinancial covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain certain leverage ratios, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios, secured borrowing ratios. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders under certain circumstances. However, we may make distributions to the extent necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code. In addition to the financial covenants described above, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit or restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and liens, consummate mergers or other fundamental changes, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, make certain investments, modify our organizational documents, transact with affiliates, change our fiscal periods, provide negative pledge clauses, make subsidiary distributions, enter into certain new lines of business or engage in certain activities, and fail to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. 
 2027 Term Loan 
 On February 18, 2022, we, through our Operating Partnership, amended our existing 430.0 million term loan credit facility (the "2027 Term Loan") to, among other things, reduce the Applicable Margin, extend the maturity date to February 18, 2027 and make certain other changes consistent with market terms and conditions. In August 2022, the 2027 Term Loan was further amended to revise the applicable margin grid such that the applicable pricing is based on the credit rating of the Company s long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt for borrowed money (subject to a single step-down in the applicable pricing if the Company achieves a consolidated leverage ratio that is less than 0.35 to 1:00 while maintaining a credit rating of BBB/Baa2 provided by S P, Moody's and/or Fitch). 
 The borrowings under the 2027 Term Loan, as amended, bear interest at an annual rate of applicable Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin. The Adjusted Term SOFR is a rate with a term equivalent to the interest period applicable to the relevant borrowing. The applicable margin was initially a spread set according to a leverage-based pricing grid. In May 2022, the Operating Partnership made an irrevocable election to have the applicable margin be a spread set according to the Company s corporate credit ratings provided by S P, Moody s and/or Fitch. The 2027 Term Loan is pre-payable at any time by the Operating

 Partnership without penalty. The 2027 Term Loan has an accordion feature to increase, subject to certain conditions, the maximum availability of the facility up to an aggregate of 500 million. 
 The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the 2027 Term Loan, and we and certain of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own a direct or indirect interest in an eligible real property asset are guarantors under the facility. Under the terms of the 2027 Term Loan, we are subject to customary restrictive financial and nonfinancial covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain certain leverage ratios, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios, and secured borrowing ratios. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 The 2027 Term Loan restricts our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders under certain circumstances. However, we may make distributions to the extent necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code. The 2027 Term Loan contains certain additional covenants that, subject to exceptions, limit or restrict our incurrence of indebtedness and liens, disposition of assets, transactions with affiliates, mergers and fundamental changes, modification of organizational documents, changes to fiscal periods, making of investments, negative pledge clauses and lines of business and REIT qualification. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 On June 22, 2021, the Operating Partnership issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.950 Senior Notes due 2031 (the "2031 Notes"), resulting in net proceeds of 396.6 million. The 2031 Notes were issued by the Operating Partnership and the obligations of the Operating Partnership under the 2031 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company. 
 The indenture and supplemental indenture creating the 2031 Notes contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 32.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and 6.1 million of restricted cash, as compared to 36.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and 5.9 million of restricted cash as of September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 221.4 million and our net income was 148.1 million. Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates specified in our leases, the interest on our loans and direct financing lease receivables, the collectability of rent and interest and the level of our operating expenses and general and administrative costs. Our cash inflows from operating activities reflect adjustments to net income for non-cash items of 82.1 million, including i) depreciation and amortization of tangible, intangible and right-of-use real estate assets and amortization of deferred financing costs and other non-cash interest expense of 93.9 million, ii) our provision for impairment of real estate of 12.3 million and iii) non-cash equity-based compensation expense of 8.2 million, reduced by i) our 1.4 million gain on dispositions of real estate, net, and ii) 31.5 million related to the recognition of straight-line rent receivables. Additional outflows were from our decrease in accrued liabilities and other payables of 2.5 million and the increase in our rent receivables, prepaid expenses and other assets, net of 6.2 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 848.5 million. Our net cash used in investing activities generally reflects our investment in real estate, including capital expenditures and construction in progress, in lease incentives and in loans receivable, which totaled 892.7 million in the aggregate for the quarter. These cash outflows were partially offset by 36.2 million of proceeds from sales of investments, net of disposition costs, and 8.0 million of principal collections on our loans and direct financing lease receivables. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 616.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected net cash inflows of 244.7 million from the issuance of common stock, 360.0 million of borrowings 
 51

 under the Revolving Credit Facility, and 174.6 million of borrowings under the 2030 Term Loan. These cash inflows were partially offset by the payment of 148.5 million in dividends, repayment of 10.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the payment of 3.3 million in taxes related to the net settlement of equity awards upon vesting.

 (1) Includes obligations to reimburse certain of our tenants for development, construction and renovation costs that they incur related to properties leased from the Company in exchange for contractual payments of interest or increased rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding. 
 (2) Includes 21.1 million of rental payments due under ground lease arrangements where our tenants are directly responsible for payment. 
 Additionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operation of our business. These commitments generally have terms of one-year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures as adjusted for growth. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions include, among other things, subjective judgments regarding the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation and lease classification purposes, the collectability of receivables and asset impairment analysis. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We have not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this quarterly report.

Our 407 tenants operate 583 different concepts in 16 industries across 49 states. None of our tenants represented more than 4.3 of our portfolio at September 30, 2024, and our top ten largest tenants represented 17.7 of our annualized base rent as of that date.

 As of September 30, 2024, 96.4 of our leases (based on annualized base rent) were triple-net, and the tenant is typically responsible for all improvements and is contractually obligated to pay all operating expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, utility and tax expense, related to the leased property. Due to the triple-net structure of our leases, we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures relating to our triple-net leased properties, and the potential impact of inflation on our operating expenses is reduced.

 Implied Tenant Credit Ratings 
 Tenant financial distress is typically caused by consistently poor or deteriorating operating performance, near-term liquidity issues or unexpected liabilities. To assess the probability of tenant insolvency, we utilize Moody s Analytics RiskCalc, which is a model for predicting private company defaults based on Moody s Analytics Credit Research Database, which incorporates both market and company-specific risk factors. The following table illustrates the portions of our annualized base rent as of September 30, 2024 attributable to leases with tenants having specified implied credit ratings based on their Moody s RiskCalc scores:

 Revenues: 
 Rental revenue . Rental revenue increased by 23.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in rental revenue was driven primarily by the growth in our real estate investment portfolio which grew by 249 rental properties, or 15 , since September 30, 2023. A portion of our real estate investments were acquired throughout the periods presented and were not all owned by us for the entirety of the applicable periods; accordingly, a significant portion of the increase in rental revenue between periods is related to recognizing revenue in 2024 from acquisitions that were made during 2023 and early 2024. 
 Interest on loans and direct financing lease receivables. Interest on loans and direct financing lease receivables increased by 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in our mortgage loans receivable portfolio during 2024, which led to a higher average daily balance of loans receivable outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other revenue, net . Other revenue increased by approximately 23,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the receipt of lean termination fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Expenses: 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expense increased by 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in salary expense and professional fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Property expenses . Property expenses increased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in property expenses was primarily due to increased reimbursable property taxes and property-related operational costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 4.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in proportion to the increase in the size of our real estate portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for impairment of real estate . Impairment charges on real estate investments were 5.7 million and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate on seven and one of our real estate investments, respectively. We strategically seek to identify non-performing properties that we may re-lease or dispose of in an effort to improve our returns and manage risk exposure. An increase in vacancy associated with our disposition or re-leasing strategies may trigger impairment charges when the expected future cash flows from the properties from sale or re-lease are less than their net book value. 
 Change in provision for credit losses. The change in our provision for credit losses in our loan portfolio increased by 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Under ASC 326, we are required to re-evaluate the expected loss on our portfolio of loans and direct financing lease receivables at each balance sheet date. Changes in our provision for credit losses are driven by revisions to global and asset-specific assumptions in our credit loss model and by changes in the size of our loan and direct financing lease portfolio. 
 Other operating income: 
 (Loss) gain on dispositions of real estate, net. (Loss) gain on dispositions of real estate, net, decreased by 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We disposed of nine and 10 real estate properties during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other (expense)/income: 
 Interest expense . Interest expense increased by 9.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in our outstanding debt balance and increased interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income . Interest income increased by 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in our short term investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased by approximately 3,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We are organized and operate as a REIT and are generally not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. However, the Operating Partnership is subject to taxation in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose income taxes on a partnership.

 Revenues: 
 Rental revenue . Rental revenue increased by 66.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in rental revenue was driven primarily by the growth in the size of our real estate investment portfolio, which generated additional revenues. Our real estate investment portfolio grew from 1,648 rental properties, representing 4.3 billion in net investments in real estate, as of September 30, 2023 to 1,899 rental properties, representing 5.3 billion in net investments in real estate, as of September 30, 2024. Our real estate investments were acquired throughout the periods presented and were not all owned by us for the entirety of the applicable periods; accordingly, a significant portion of the increase in rental revenue between periods is related to recognizing revenue in 2024 from acquisitions that were made during 2023 and early 2024. 
 Interest on loans and direct financing lease receivables. Interest on loans and direct financing lease receivables increased by 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in investments in loans receivable during 2024, leading to a higher average daily balance of loans receivable outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other revenue, net . Other revenue decreased by 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the receipt of insurance claim proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Expenses: 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in non-cash share-based compensation, salary expense, and professional fees incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Property expenses . Property expenses increased by 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in property expenses was primarily due to increased reimbursable property taxes and property-related operational costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense . Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 14.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in proportion to the increase in the size of our real estate portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for impairment of real estate . Impairment charges on real estate investments were 12.3 million and 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a provision for impairment of real estate on 17 and five of our real estate investments, respectively. We strategically seek to identify non-performing properties that we may re-lease or dispose of in an effort to improve our returns and manage risk exposure. An increase in vacancy associated with our disposition or re-leasing strategies may trigger impairment charges when the expected future cash flows from the properties from sale or re-lease are less than their net book value. 
 Change in provision for loan losses. The change in our provision for credit losses in our loan portfolio increased by 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

(Loss) gain on dispositions of real estate, net, decreased by 17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We disposed of 22 and 43 real estate properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other (expense)/income: 
 Interest expense . Interest expense increased by 17.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in our outstanding debt balance and increased interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest income . Interest income increased by 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in our short term investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 1.5 million of other income related to the settlement of litigation with a former tenant. Substantially all of this amount relates to proceeds received to recoup legal fees and other related expenses previously incurred associated with enforcing our rights under the leases with the former tenant. 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased by approximately 2,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures: funds from operations FFO ), core funds from operations Core FFO ), adjusted funds from operations AFFO ), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), EBITDA further adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses EBITDA re ), adjusted EBITDA re , annualized adjusted EBITDA re , net debt, net operating income NOI and cash NOI Cash NOI ). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO is used by management, and may be useful to investors and analysts, to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains and losses on sales (which are dependent on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions). 
 We compute Core FFO by adjusting FFO, as defined by NAREIT, to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that we believe are infrequent and unusual in nature and/or not related to our core real estate operations. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the equity REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a metric to assist in their evaluation of our operating performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of our peers, because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact our operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core FFO is used by management in evaluating the performance of our core business operations. Items included in calculating FFO that may be excluded in calculating Core FFO include certain transaction related gains, losses, income or expense or other non-core amounts as they occur. 
 To derive AFFO, we modify our computation of Core FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, including straight-line rental revenue, non-cash interest, non-cash compensation expense, other amortization expense, other non-cash charges and capitalized interest expense. Such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows or long-term operating performance. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider when assessing our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash items and certain other revenues and expenses. 
 FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income, they do not represent cash generated from operating activities and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Additionally, our computation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating these metrics used by other equity REITs and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other equity REITs.

 We compute EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. In 2017, NAREIT issued a white paper recommending that companies that report EBITDA also report EBITDA re . We compute EBITDA re in accordance with the definition adopted by NAREIT. NAREIT defines EBITDA re as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding gains (or losses) from the sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses. We present EBITDA and EBITDA re as they are measures commonly used in our industry. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and analysts because they provide supplemental information concerning our operating performance, exclusive of certain non-cash items and other costs. We use EBITDA and EBITDA re as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity. 
 EBITDA and EBITDA re do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income, they do not represent cash generated from operating activities and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Additionally, our computation of EBITDA and EBITDA re may differ from the methodology for calculating these metrics used by other equity REITs and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other equity REITs.

 We further adjust EBITDA re for the most recently completed quarter (i) based on an estimate calculated as if all re-leasing, investment and disposition activity that took place during the quarter had been made on the first day of the quarter; (ii) to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that we believe are infrequent and unusual in nature; and (iii) to eliminate the impact of lease termination fees and contingent rental revenue from certain of our tenants, which is subject to sales thresholds specified in the applicable leases Adjusted EBITDA re ). We then annualize quarterly Adjusted EBITDA re by multiplying it by four Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re ), which we believe provides a meaningful estimate of our current run rate for all of our investments as of the end of the most recently completed quarter. You should not unduly rely on this measure, as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDA re for future periods may be significantly less than our current Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re .

 (1) Adjustment assumes all re-leasing activity, investments in and dispositions of real estate and loan repayments completed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 had occurred on July 1, 2024. 
 (2) Adjustment is made to i) exclude non-core adjustments made in computing Core FFO, ii) exclude changes in our provision for credit losses and iii) eliminate the impact of seasonal fluctuation in certain non-cash compensation expense recorded in the period. 
 (3) Adjustment excludes lease termination or loan prepayment fees and contingent rent (based on a percentage of the tenant's gross sales at the leased property) where payment is subject to exceeding a sales threshold specified in the lease, if any. 
 We calculate our net debt as our gross debt (defined as total debt plus net deferred financing costs on our secured borrowings) less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash available for future investment. We believe excluding cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash available for future investment from gross debt, all of which could be used to repay debt, provides an estimate of the net contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid, which we believe is a beneficial disclosure to investors and analysts.

 We compute NOI as total revenues less property expenses. NOI excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income or loss, in accordance with GAAP. Cash NOI further excludes non-cash items included in total revenues and property expenses, such as straight-line rental

 revenue and other amortization and non-cash charges. We believe NOI and Cash NOI provide useful and relevant information because they reflect only those revenue and expense items that are incurred at the property level and present such items on an unlevered basis. 
 NOI and Cash NOI are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. You should not consider our NOI and Cash NOI as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our computation of NOI and Cash NOI may differ from the methodology for calculating these metrics used by other equity REITs, and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other equity REITs.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Over time, we generally seek to match the expected cash inflows from our long-term leases and loans receivable with the expected cash outflows for our long-term debt. To seek to achieve this objective, we issue senior unsecured notes and borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility and through term loans.

Table of Contents 

 While our borrowings under the the 2027 Term Loan, 2028 Term Loan, 2029 Term Loan and 2030 Term Loan are variable-rate, we have effectively fixed the interest rate under these term loans by entering into interest rate swap agreements where we pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate equal to the rate we pay on the respective loan. At September 30, 2024, our aggregate liability in the event of the early termination of our swaps was 23.1 million. 
 Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility from time to time bear interest at a variable rate equal to 1-month SOFR plus a leverage-based credit spread. Therefore, an increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease to our interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility. We monitor our market interest rate risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Based on the results of a sensitivity analysis, which assumes a 100-basis point adverse change in interest rates, the estimated market risk exposure for our variable rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk between the time we enter into a sale-leaseback transaction, acquire a leased property or invest in a loan receivable and the time we finance the related asset with long-term fixed-rate debt. In addition, when our long-term debt matures, we may have to refinance the debt at a higher interest rate. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows. 
 In addition to amounts that we borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, we may incur variable-rate debt in the future that we do not choose to hedge. Additionally, decreases in interest rates may lead to increased competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate we have targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to acquire real estate with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 
 Fair Value of Fixed-Rate Indebtedness 
 The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate indebtedness under our senior unsecured notes is calculated based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The following table discloses fair value information related to our fixed-rate indebtedness as of September 30, 2024: 
 (in thousands) Carrying Value (1) 
 Estimated Fair Value Senior unsecured notes 400,000 347,696

 (1) Excludes net deferred financing costs of 3.2 million and net discount of 0.5 million. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance. 
 68 

Changes in Internal Control 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subject to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. Management does not believe that the resolution of any of these matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, from time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings for which third parties, such as our tenants, are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. In some of these matters, the indemnitors may have insurance for the potential damages. In other matters, we may be being defended by tenants who may not have sufficient insurance, assets, income or resources to satisfy their defense and indemnification obligations to us. The unfavorable resolution of such legal proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect the indemnitors' ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. It is management's opinion that there are currently no such legal proceedings pending that will, individually or in the aggregate, have such a material adverse effect. Despite management's view of the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings, we may have significant legal expenses and costs associated with the defense of such matters. Further, management cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings and if management's expectation regarding such matters is not correct, such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 15 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. These risk factors may not describe every risk facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 None of our directors or officers , modified or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
