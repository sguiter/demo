 Revenues by customer-type, contract-type and geographic location exclude lease income of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, respectively. 
 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 Performance obligations are satisfied either over time as work progresses or at a point in time. Firm-fixed-price contracts are typically billed to the customer using milestone payments while cost-reimbursable and time and materials contracts are typically billed to the customer on a monthly or bi-weekly basis as indicated by the negotiated billing terms and conditions of the contract. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition, customer billings and cash collections for each contract results in a net contract asset or liability at the end of each reporting period. 
 Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables, which is the amount of revenue recognized that exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Unbilled receivables exclude amounts billable where the right to consideration is solely subject to the passage of time. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue, which represents cash advances received prior to performance for programs and billings in excess of revenue recognized. 
 Contract liabilities - current: Deferred revenue (1) 
 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Contract liabilities - non-current: Deferred revenue (1) 
 Other long-term liabilities 
 (1) Certain contracts record revenue net of cost of revenues, and therefore, the respective deferred revenue balance will not fully convert to revenue. 
 The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to revenue recognized on certain contracts, partially offset by the timing of billings. The decrease in deferred revenue was primarily due to revenue recognized during the period, offset by the timing of advanced payments from customers. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, million and million, respectively, of revenue recognized was included as a contract liability at December 29, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, million and million, respectively, of revenue recognized was included as a contract liability at December 30, 2022.

 We evaluate qualitative factors that could cause us to consider whether the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units may be lower than the carrying value and trigger a quantitative assessment, including, but not limited to (i) macroeconomic conditions, (ii) industry and market considerations, (iii) our overall financial performance, including an analysis of our current and projected cash flows, revenues and earnings, (iv) a sustained decrease in share price and (v) other relevant entity-specific events including changes in management, strategy, partners or litigation. 
 Operations of the Security Enterprise Solutions SES reporting unit rely heavily on the sales and servicing of security and detection products, which prior to fiscal 2024, have been negatively impacted due to delays in airline travel infrastructure projects as customer budgets recover from the pandemic. During fiscal 2023, the SES reporting unit refined its portfolio and made strategic business decisions to exit certain product offerings, and cease operations in certain countries in order to align the operations of the reporting unit with its strategic business plan. These decisions, along with the delays in airline travel infrastructure projects and higher than anticipated servicing costs, contributed to a significant reduction in the reporting unit s forecasted revenue and cash flows. Accordingly, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of million at the SES reporting unit during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023. The impairment was recorded within the Commercial International reportable segment in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In the event that there are significant unfavorable changes to the forecasted cash flows, forecasted revenue, terminal growth rates or the cost of capital used in the fair value estimates, we may be required to record an additional impairment of goodwill at a future date. 
 In conjunction with the change in reportable segments in fiscal 2024, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment both before and after the segment change and determined that goodwill was not impaired.

 Our strategic decisions regarding SES product offerings and operating regions (see the goodwill discussion above) caused certain technology and in-process research and development intangible assets to be abandoned and the carrying values of certain program intangible assets to become unrecoverable. As a result, for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million. The impairment was recorded to Asset impairment charges in the condensed consolidated statements of operations within the Commercial International reportable segment. 
 Amortization expense was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, respectively. 
 Program intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives in proportion to the pattern of economic benefit based on expected future discounted cash flows.

As of September 27, 2024, and December 29, 2023, our derivatives primarily consisted of the cash flow interest rate swaps on million of the variable rate senior unsecured term loan (see "Note 5 Derivative Instruments"). The fair value of the cash flow interest rate swaps is determined based on observed values for underlying interest rates on the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate (Level 2 inputs). 
 The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, other than derivatives, which include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are reasonable estimates of their related fair values. 
 As of September 27, 2024, and December 29, 2023, the fair value of debt was billion for both periods, and the carrying amount was billion for both periods (see "Note 6 Debt"). The fair value of long-term debt is determined based on current interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to our existing debt arrangements and our credit rating (Level 2 inputs). 
 During the three months ended September 29, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of SES' goodwill (see "Note 3 Goodwill and Intangible Assets"). The fair values of the assets and liabilities of the SES reporting unit were determined using a blended approach, including discounted cash flow models and market earnings multiples. The market approach estimates fair value based on profitability and valuation metrics for peer companies and applies a multiple to the reporting unit's operating performance. The income approach estimates fair value by discounting the reporting unit's estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital reflecting current market conditions as well as the risk profile of the reporting unit. Future cash flows are based on estimates of economic and market assumptions made using the best judgment of management, including growth rates in revenue and margins, and future changes in tax rates and cash expenditures. Other significant assumptions and estimates include estimates of future capital expenditures, terminal value growth rates, and changes in future working capital requirements. The fair value of the SES reporting unit was determined using Level 3 inputs.

(1) As of December 29, 2023, the cash flow interest rate swaps were reported in the "other long-term assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 The cash flows associated with the interest rate swaps are classified as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 We have interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of million of the variable rate senior unsecured term loan (the "Variable Rate Loan"). These interest rate swap agreements have a maturity date of August 2025 and a fixed interest rate of . The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Variable Rate Loan. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we will receive monthly variable interest payments based on the one-month SOFR and will pay interest at a fixed rate. 
 The interest rate swap transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The gain/loss on the swaps is reported as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and is reclassified into earnings when the interest payments on the underlying hedged items impact earnings. A qualitative assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed on a quarterly basis, unless facts and circumstances indicate the hedge may no longer be highly effective.

 The following discussion and analysis of Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s ("Leidos") financial condition, results of operations, and quantitative and qualitative discussion about business environment and trends should be read in conjunction with Leidos' condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
 The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our intent, belief or current expectations with respect to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations, backlog, our industry, the impact of our merger and acquisition activity, government budgets and spending, our business contingency plans, interest rates and uncertainties in tax due to new tax legislation or other regulatory developments. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as will, expect, estimate, plan, potential, continue or similar expressions. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by the risk factor in this report under Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and as may be further updated in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Due to such uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to update these factors or to publicly announce the results of any changes to our forward-looking statements due to future events or developments. 
 Unless indicated otherwise, references in this report to "we," "us" and "our" refer collectively to Leidos and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 Leidos, a member of the Fortune 500 , is a dynamic innovation company that is at the forefront of addressing the world s most challenging issues in national security and health sectors. With a global workforce of approximately 48,000, Leidos is committed to developing smarter technology solutions, particularly for customers in highly regulated industries. We bring domain-specific capability and cross-market innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging five technical core capabilities: digital modernization, cyber operations, mission software systems, integrated systems and mission operations. Our customers include the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and many other U.S. civilian, state and local government agencies, foreign government agencies and commercial businesses. 
 Beginning in fiscal 2024, we realigned our business and operate in four reportable segments that are focused on specific, defined capability sets we bring to our customers. As a result of this change, prior year segment results and disclosures have been recast to reflect the current reportable segment structure. We now operate in the following reportable segments: National Security Digital, Health Civil, Commercial International and Defense Systems. We also separately present the unallocable costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate (see "Note 10 Business Segments"). 
 
 Business Environment and Trends 
 U.S. Government Markets 
 During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, we generated approximately 87 of total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, as compared to 87 and 86 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, respectively. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially on national security, homeland security and intelligence, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government. 
 On September 26, 2024, Congress avoided a federal government shutdown by passing a continuing resolution that provides government funding through December 20, 2024. The continuing resolution gives lawmakers additional time after the November elections to consider the 12 appropriations bills for government fiscal year 2025, emergency supplemental funding for the recent hurricanes and wildfires, and organize new leadership of the House of Representatives and Senate. Failure to pass the appropriation bills or another continuing resolution by December 20, 2024, will result in a partial or complete federal government shutdown.

International Markets 
 Sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 8 of total revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 9 for both the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies. Our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks. 
 Changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials, may increase the procurement cost of certain IT hardware used both on our contracts and internally. However, we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our cost-plus contracts. We are currently evaluating the impact of higher tariffs, and do not expect the tariffs to have a significant impact to our business.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had 1,185 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility which can provide up to 1 billion in additional borrowing, if required. As of September 27, 2024, and December 29, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 
 We had outstanding debt of 4.7 billion at both September 27, 2024, and December 29, 2023. 
 We have a commercial paper program in which we may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes ("Commercial Paper Notes") and have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. As of September 27, 2024, and December 29, 2023, we did not have any Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. 
 We made principal payments, excluding the impacts of our Commercial Paper Notes, on our debt of 5 million and 14 million during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, respectively, and 5 million and 2,041 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, respectively. The activity for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, included a 1,210 million payment to discharge the 1.9 billion 5.77 senior unsecured term loan facility, a 498 million payment to discharge the 500 million 2.95 notes, due May 2023, and a required principal payment of 320 million to discharge the 364-day term loan credit agreement.

 Summary of Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities

 (257) (249) (644) (470) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 139 million during the three months ended September 27, 2024, when compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital, partially offset by higher earnings and the timing of payroll and employee benefit accruals. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 232 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024, when compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings and lower tax payments of 49 million primarily due to payments made in the prior year for the TCJA provision and payroll taxes related to the CARES act. 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 29 million and 79 million during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The decreases were primarily due to lower capital expenditures of 27 million and 66 million for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, respectively. 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 8 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to a 202 million increase in stock repurchases, partially offset by 200 million in commercial paper net proceeds received in the prior year. 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 174 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, when compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 425 million increase in stock repurchases, a 31 million increase in shares withheld for tax obligations, partially offset by a decrease of 291 million in net payments made on debt activities. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in "Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, operations or financial condition.
