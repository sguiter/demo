Based on current operating levels, the Company will need to raise additional funds in the next 12 months by selling additional equity or incurring debt. As the Company gains traction in the market with its new technology and continues to invest capital in transitioning and scaling the business from research and development of new technologies to commercial production, there can be no assurance that its available resources and revenue generated from its business operations will be sufficient to sustain its operations. Accordingly, the Company expects to pursue additional financing, which could include offerings of equity or debt securities, bank financings, commercial agreements with customers or strategic partners, and other alternatives, depending upon market conditions. There is no assurance that such financing will be available on terms that the Company would find acceptable, or at all. If the Company is unsuccessful in implementing this plan, the Company will be required to make further cost and expense reductions or modifications to its on-going and strategic plans. The market for products using the Company s technology is broad and evolving, but remains nascent and unproven, so the Company s success is dependent upon many factors, including customer acceptance of its existing products, technical feasibility of future products, regulatory approvals, the development of complementary technologies, competition and global market fluctuations.

 warrants to purchase up to shares of its common stock. The 2023 Warrants have a term and were exercisable upon issuance on March 28, 2023. Each 2023 Warrant was initially exercisable for share of the Company s common stock at a price of per share. As of September 30, 2024, the exercise price was adjusted to per share (subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances, including in the event of stock dividends and splits; recapitalizations; change of control transactions; and issuances or sales of, or agreements to issue or sell, shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the then-applicable exercise price for the 2023 Warrants, including sales under the ATM Program, the Exercise Price ). In the event of certain transactions such as a merger, consolidation, tender offer, reorganization, or other change in control, if holders of common stock are given any choice as to the consideration to be received, the holder of each 2023 Warrant shall be given the same choice of alternate consideration. In the event of certain transactions that are not within the Company s control, such as a merger, consolidation, tender offer, reorganization, or other change in control of the Company, each holder of a 2023 Warrant shall be entitled to receive the same form of consideration at the Black Scholes value of the unexercised portion of the 2023 Warrant that is being offered and paid to holders of common stock, including the option to exercise the 2023 Warrants on a cashless basis . If the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for a consideration per share less than the Exercise Price, then such Exercise Price will be reduced to a new lower price pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Warrants. Additionally, if the Exercise Price of any outstanding derivative securities is modified by the Company such that such security s modified exercise price is below the Exercise Price, the Exercise Price will adjust downward pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Warrant. This provision would not apply for stock or stock equivalents which fall under shares that qualify for exempt issuance, such as if the Company adjusted the option exercise price for an option granted to an employee, officer, or director. The Company accounted for the 2023 Warrants in accordance with the derivative guidance contained in ASC 815-40, as the warrants did not meet the criteria for equity treatment. The Company believes that the adjustments to the Exercise Price is based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed option as defined under ASC 815-40, and thus the 2023 Warrants are not eligible for an exception from derivative accounting. As such, the 2023 Warrants were initially measured at fair value and recorded as a liability in the amount of million. As of September 30, 2024, all 2023 Warrants were outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the warrant liability was million. The Company recorded a change in fair value of the warrant liability of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded a change in fair value of the warrant liability of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. Although we believe that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time the estimates and assumptions were made. Actual results could differ from those estimates. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, management believes there have been no significant changes to the items that we disclosed within our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Results of Operations Costs and Expenses Cost of revenue consists of direct materials, direct labor and overhead for our production-level wireless charging systems. Research and development expenses include costs associated with our efforts to develop our technology, including personnel compensation, consulting, engineering supplies and components, intellectual property costs, regulatory expense and general office expenses specifically related to the research and development department. Sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with selling and marketing our technology to our customers, including personnel compensation, public relations, graphic design, tradeshow, engineering supplies utilized by the sales team and general office expenses specifically related to the sale and marketing department. General and administrative expenses include costs for general and corporate functions, including personnel compensation, facility fees, travel, telecommunications, insurance, professional fees, consulting fees, general office expenses, and other overhead.

 Revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded revenue of 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of transmitter sales volume versus the majority of revenue being derived from non-recurring engineering fees and the sale of semiconductor chips during the same period in 2023. This shift in revenue focus represents the beginning of the Company s transition from research and development to commercial production of its PowerBridge transmitters. Costs and Expenses and Loss from Operations. Costs and expenses are made up of cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and severance expense. Loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.6 million and 5.1 million, respectively. Cost of Revenue: 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Cost of sales 306 48 258 538 Percent of total revenue 133 28 Cost of revenue was 0.3 million and less than 0.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase is primarily due to the cost of transmitters sold, as the initial sales of 2-watt PowerBridge transmitters that were shipped during the third quarter of 2024 were built in-house. We believe the cost of producing these transmitters will decrease in future quarters, as we utilize a contract manufacturer more often. During the same period in 2023, revenue generated by transmitter sales represented a small percentage of the total revenue for that period, as the revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted mainly of non-recurring engineering fees for which the cost was included in research and development costs.

The changes for both periods were due to a lower market value of our common stock. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10,000 as compared to interest income of 179,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a lower average cash balance in our savings account during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. Net Loss. As a result of the above, net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.4 million as compared to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded revenue of 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The decrease is due to a decrease in non-recurring engineering revenue. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of transmitter sales volume versus the majority of revenue being derived from non-recurring engineering fees and the sale of semiconductor chips during the same period in 2023. This shift in revenue focus represents the beginning of the Company s transition from research and development to commercial production of its PowerBridge transmitters. Costs and Expenses and Loss from Operations. Costs and expenses are made up of cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and severance expense.

The decrease of 1.9 million is primarily due to a 1.2 million decrease in employee compensation, consisting primarily of a 0.9 million decrease in personnel-related expenses and a 0.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a 0.4 million decrease in software and maintenance costs, a 0.1 million decrease in test development costs, a 0.1 million decrease in consulting and third-party expenses and a 0.1 million decrease in travel and miscellaneous office expenses, partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in engineering components and circuit boards.

The decrease of 0.7 million is primarily due to a 0.7 million decrease in employee compensation, consisting of a 0.6 million decrease in personnel related expenses due to a lower headcount within the department and a 0.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a 0.1 million decrease in tradeshow expense and a 0.1 million decrease in software, travel and miscellaneous office expenses, partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in consulting fees.

 General and administrative costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.4 million and 5.8 million, respectively. The decrease of 1.3 million is primarily due to a 0.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a 0.3 million decrease in insurance premiums, a 0.3 million decrease in consulting and third-party service fees, a 0.2 million decrease in legal fees, a 0.1 million decrease in computer software and support and a 0.1 million decrease in travel and miscellaneous office expenses, partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in public relations and annual meeting costs.

We did not incur such cost during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other income resulting from the change in fair value of the warrant liability was 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes for both periods were due to a lower market value of our common stock Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million as compared to interest income of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a lower average cash balance in our savings account during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. Net Loss. As a result of the above, net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.3 million as compared to 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded revenue of 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively. We incurred net losses of 14.3 million and 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was 14.9 million and 15.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 1.5 million. We are currently meeting our liquidity requirements through the proceeds of securities offerings that raised net proceeds of 2.5 million during 2024. Based on current operating levels, we will need to raise additional funds in the next 12 months by selling additional equity or incurring debt. As we gain traction in the market with our new technology and continue to invest capital in transitioning and scaling the business from research and development of new technologies to commercial production, there can be no assurance that our available resources and revenue generated from our business operations will be sufficient to sustain our operations.

If we are unsuccessful in implementing this plan, we will be required to make further cost and expense reductions or modifications to our on-going and strategic plans.
