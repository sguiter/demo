SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report (the Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, will, would and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading Risk Factors . Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. These risks and others described under Risk Factors may not be exhaustive. 
 By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The goodwill impairment analysis referenced above used the discounted cash flow model (income approach) utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs. Significant assumptions in this analysis included, but were not limited to, future cash flow projections, the weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the tax rate. Estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and planned business strategies. These estimates could be negatively affected by changes in federal, state, or local regulations or economic downturns. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from estimates. We believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Loss per Common Share Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including those related to our outstanding warrants and stock equity plans, to the extent dilutive. For all periods presented, these shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share of common stock because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for all periods presented.

We generate revenue in domestic and foreign regions and attribute net revenue to individual countries based on the location of the contracting entity. We derived over of our net revenues from within the United States for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue consists of customer billings or payments received in advance of the recognition of revenue under the arrangements with customers. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when revenue recognition criteria are met. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized revenue of that was included in our deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023. Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations were as of September 30, 2024 , of which we expect to recognize approximately as revenue over the next months and the remainder thereafter. 

 in a private placement. The 2022 Promissory Note was sold with an original issue discount of and we paid, at closing, issuance costs totaling . After deducting all transaction fees paid by us at closing, net cash proceeds to the Company at closing were . No interest was to accrue on the 2022 Promissory Note. Beginning on November 1, 2022, our monthly amortization payment was approximately , which includes a premium until the original maturity date of July 1, 2023. We had the right to defer any monthly payment by up to twelve times so long as certain conditions, as defined in the 2022 Promissory Note, were satisfied. In the event we exercised the deferral right, the outstanding balance would automatically increase by . On March 15, 2023, we elected to defer monthly payment obligations for April, May, June and July 2023, as permitted, at the time, by the 2022 Promissory Note. In connection therewith, we entered into a waiver agreement with the holder waiving the Payment Deferral Conditions, as defined in the 2022 Promissory Note. For agreeing to waive the Payment Deferral Conditions, we agreed to compensate the noteholder an amount equal to of the outstanding balance immediately before entering into the waiver agreement. We evaluated the modification in accordance with the guidance as in ASC 470 - Debt , and we concluded that the modification was not an extinguishment of the original debt; therefore, no gain or loss was recognized upon modification. On August 14, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the 2022 Promissory Note with the noteholder. The amendment extended the maturity date to May 31, 2024 and provided that effective August 1, 2023, we were required to make monthly amortization payments of at least commencing on August 31, 2023 until the 2022 Promissory Note was paid-in-full. Furthermore, the amendment removed the required payment due on August 1, 2023. We also granted the holder certain limited conversion rights, subject to advance payment and volume conditions. Conversions into shares of our common stock made pursuant to the limited conversion rights were calculated on a conversion price equal to of the lower of (i) the closing trading price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date for such conversion or (ii) the average closing trading price of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date for such conversion. If the holder elected to convert pursuant to the limited conversion option, such conversions would reduce the current month s monthly amortization payment. Any conversions in any given month in excess of the monthly payment would be applied to reduce the following month s required monthly amortization payment. In connection with the amendment, we agreed to pay an extension fee equal to approximately . The amendment also provided that the outstanding balance was to accrue interest at a rate of beginning on August 1, 2023, and payment deferrals were no longer permitted.

, or approximately , of the outstanding balance of the 2022 Promissory Note. The fee was added to the outstanding balance of the 2022 Promissory Note. During the first quarter of 2024, we issued shares of our common stock to the holder of the 2022 Promissory Note, which amounted to aggregate principal and interest payments in the amount of . These conversions were made pursuant to the terms of the amended 2022 Promissory Note. In addition, conversions were made in connection with the Company granting the holder additional conversion rights. As a result, the noteholder agreed to waive an aggregate of in principal and accrued interest. As a result of the conversions, the 2022 Promissory Note has been paid-in-full. Interest Expense Interest expense amounted to and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

actions were then removed to arbitration. Phunware sought affirmative relief in these actions, as stated in the complaints, for damages according to proof, interest and costs of suit. WSGR filed crossclaims against Phunware in these actions related to services provided by WSGR to Phunware and sought to recover fees related to the services at issue in these actions and interest. In March 2024, WSGR and Phunware settled their claims in the arbitration proceeding relating to Case No. 21CV381517 and Phunware paid approximately of the outstanding amount alleged to be owed by Phunware to WSGR in that proceeding. The Phunware and WSGR claims related to Case No. 21CV386411 remain pending in arbitration and the remaining balance of the payables amount alleged to be owed by Phunware will continue to be arbitrated. On August 16, 2024, the Company and WSGR entered into an agreed stay of that arbitration proceeding, which provides for a mutually agreed upon stay of that proceeding until the earlier to occur of (a) August 30, 2025 (subject to either party's right to move to lift the stay earlier than that date for good cause) and (b) the settlement or issuance of a judgment in the Wild Basin litigation, as more fully described below. The outcome of this proceeding and the related Phunware and WSGR claims is uncertain. There is and

million from the Company s insurers to the Plaintiffs, the payment of million from the insurers to Phunware and the release of the insurers subrogation claims against Phunware recoveries from WSGR or its insurers in the WSGR arbitration proceeding. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an accrual within accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in the aggregate amount of million, as well as a million receivable for loss recovery within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for the insurance proceeds related to the settlement. Further, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million charge and an offsetting million recovery in other income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to reflect the settlement and insurance proceeds receivable, respectively. The Plaintiffs claims against Phunware in this lawsuit remain in effect and the case remains scheduled for bench trial in March 2025. We intend to vigorously defend against the remaining claims in this lawsuit and any appeals. We have not recorded a liability related to this matter because any potential loss is not currently probable or possible to reasonably estimate. Additionally, we cannot presently estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this lawsuit. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters, or other similar matters, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, we are and may become involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period. In addition, for the matters disclosed above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies.

Key Business Metrics 
 Our management regularly monitors certain financial measures to track the progress of our business against internal goals and targets. We believe that the most important of these measures include backlog and deferred revenue. 
 Bookings, Backlog and Deferred Revenue. We define these measures and purpose as follows: 
 Bookings represents actual contracted value for a period, whether invoiced or not, to be invoiced and recognized as revenue over time. We believe that bookings reflects the current demand for our products and services and provides us insight into how well our sales and marketing efforts are performing. 

Backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our active contracts. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, accounts receivable or elsewhere in our condensed consolidated financial statements and are considered by us to be backlog. We expect backlog to fluctuate up or down from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer contracts, varying billing cycles and the timing and duration of customer renewals. We reasonably expect approximately 38 of our backlog as of September 30, 2024 will be invoiced during the subsequent 12-month period, primarily due to the fact that our contracts are typically one to three years in length. 

Deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenues as of the end of a reporting period. Together, the sum of deferred revenue and backlog represents the total billed and unbilled contract value yet to be recognized in revenues and provides visibility into future revenue streams.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior period results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted gross profit (derived from the GAAP measure of gross profit), adjusted gross margin (derived from the GAAP measure of gross margin) and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA (derived from the GAAP measure of net loss from continuing operations) (our non-GAAP financial measures ). Management uses these measures (i) to compare operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate incentive compensation for our employees, (iii) for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of operational strategies. 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to revenue or net loss, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: 
 Non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; 

17 

Table of Contents 

Our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and 

Other companies in our industry may calculate our non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 

We compensate for these limitations to our non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using our non-GAAP financial measures only for supplemental purposes. Our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items that may not occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other peer companies over time. For example, it is useful to exclude non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and these expenses can vary significantly across periods due to timing of new stock-based awards. We may also exclude certain discrete, unusual, one-time, or non-cash costs in order to facilitate a more useful period-over-period comparison of our financial performance. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph help management with a measure of our operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses. 
 The following tables set forth the most comparable GAAP financial measures from which our non-GAAP financial measures are derived as well as the non-GAAP financial measures we monitor.

(1) Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin provide supplemental information with respect to gross profit and gross margin regarding ongoing performance. We define adjusted gross profit as net revenues less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude one-time revenue adjustments, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We define adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net revenues. 

(2) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of our business that is not dependent on (i) the impact of our capitalization structure and (ii) items that are not part of day-to-day operations. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation, and further adjusted for (iv) non-cash impairment, (v) valuation adjustments and (vi) stock-based compensation expense.

Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue and Gross Profit 
 There are a number of factors that impact the revenue and margin profile of the services and technology offerings we provide, including, but not limited to, solution and technology complexity, technical expertise requiring the combination of products and types of services provided, as well as other elements that may be specific to a particular client solution. 
 Platform Subscriptions and Services 
 Subscription revenue is derived from software license fees, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers licensing our Software Development Kits (SDKs), that include access to our platform. Services revenue is derived from development services around designing and building new applications or enhancing existing applications. Support revenue is comprised of support and maintenance fees of customer applications, software updates and technical support for application development services for a support term. 
 Subscriptions and services gross profit is equal to subscriptions and services revenue less the cost of personnel and related costs for our support and professional services employees, external consultants, stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Costs associated with our development and project management teams are generally recognized as incurred. Costs directly attributable to the development or support of applications relating to platform subscription customers are included in cost of sales, whereas costs related to the ongoing development and maintenance of our software platform are expensed in research and development. As a result, platform subscriptions and services gross profit may fluctuate from period to period. 
 Application Transaction Revenue 
 We also generate revenue by charging advertisers to deliver advertisements (ads) to users of digitally connected devices. Depending on the specific terms of each advertising contract, we generally recognize revenue when the ad loads onto the device of a user. We generally sell our ads by cost per thousand impressions and generally, an impression results when the user has the potential to see the ad. 
 Application transaction gross profit is equal to application transaction revenue less cost of revenue associated with application transactions. Application transaction gross profit is impacted by the cost of advertising traffic we pay to our suppliers and amount of traffic which we can purchase from those suppliers. As a result, our application transaction gross profit may fluctuate from period to period due to variable costs of advertising traffic. 
 Gross Margin 
 Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross margin is generally impacted by the same factors that affect changes in the mix of platform and hardware revenue. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses include sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, in sales and marketing expense, commissions. 
 19 

Table of Contents 

Sales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense is comprised of compensation, commission expense, variable incentive pay and benefits related to sales personnel, along with travel expenses, other employee related costs, including stock-based compensation and expenses related to marketing programs and promotional activities. In order to grow revenues, we may increase the size and spend of our sales and marketing organization. As a result, our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense is comprised of compensation and benefits of administrative personnel, including variable incentive pay and stock-based compensation, bad debt expenses and other administrative costs such as facilities expenses, professional fees and travel expenses. We incur general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and listing standards of Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect, over time, to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. As a result, our general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period. 
 Research and Development Expense. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs and overhead allocation. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important for our growth. As a result, our research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense includes interest related to our outstanding debt, including amortization of discounts and deferred issuance costs. 
 Refer to Note 5 Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our debt offerings. 
 We also may seek additional debt financing to fund the expansion of our business or to finance strategic acquisitions in the future, which may have an impact on our interest expense.

Net revenues decreased 0.6 million, or (46.9) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as a result of additional development fees recognized in 2023 and timing of advertising campaigns. 
 Net revenues decreased 1.3 million, or (33.3) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to 0.3 million due to a specific customer contract termination, 0.2 million in revenue recognized in 2023 related to a customer onboarding and 0.2 million for customers who were customers in 2023, but are no longer customers in 2024.

 Sales and marketing expense decreased 0.2 million, or (26.2) and 1.2 million, or (41.1) , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses as a result of lower headcount. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense decreased 0.7 million, or (26.3) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, due to a 0.5 million decrease in payroll and related expenses as a result of lower headcount, 0.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and 0.1 million in facilities costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 0.3 million decrease in professional expenses, mainly related to legal fees. 
 General and administrative expense decreased 4.3 million, or (38.1) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, due to 1.8 million decrease in payroll and related expenses as a result of lower headcount, 1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, 0.7 million decrease in professional expenses, mainly related to legal fees and 0.3 million decrease in facilities expenses. 
 Research and Development

 Impairment of goodwill

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded other income of 0.4 million, primarily as a result of interest income from cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we incurred a 2.8 million charge related to a partial settlement of a lawsuit with an offsetting 2.8 million recovery to reflect proceeds to be paid by insurance carriers related to the settlement. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies , in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion related to the settlement and insurance recovery. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded other expense of approximately 0.4 million, primarily as a result of interest expense and a loss on extinguishment of debt on our 2022 Promissory Note, as amended. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded other income of 1.3 million, primarily as a result of interest income and a recognized gain on the extinguishment of the 2022 Promissory Note. In addition, we incurred a 2.8 million charge related to a partial settlement of a lawsuit with an offsetting 2.8 million recovery to reflect proceeds to be paid by insurance carriers related to the settlement. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies , in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion related to the settlement and insurance recovery. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded other income of 4.2 million, primarily as a result of gains on sales of our digital asset holdings. This was partially offset due to interest expense related to the 2022 Promissory Note. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held total cash of 35.5 million, all of which was held in the United States. We have a history of operating losses and negative operating cash flows. As we continue to focus on growing our revenues, we expect these trends to continue into the foreseeable future. 
 On February 1, 2022, we filed a Form S-3, which was subsequently declared effective by the SEC on February 9, 2022, pursuant to which we could issue up to 200 million in common stock, preferred stock, warrants and units. Contained therein, was a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we could sell up to 100 million of our common stock in an at the market offering pursuant to an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement we entered into with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright on January 31, 2022. We terminated our agreement with Wainwright effective June 3, 2024. 
 On July 6, 2022, we entered into a note purchase agreement and completed the sale of an unsecured promissory note (referred to herein as the 2022 Promissory Note) with an original principal amount of 12.8 million in a private placement. After deducting all transaction fees paid by us at closing, net cash proceeds to us at closing were 11.8 million. No interest was to accrue on the 2022 Promissory Note. On August 14, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the 2022 Promissory Note with the noteholder. The amendment extended the maturity date to June 1, 2024 and provided that effective August 1, 2023, we were required to make monthly amortization payments of at least 800 thousand commencing on August 31, 2023 until the 2022 Promissory Note is paid-in-full. We also granted the noteholder certain limited conversion rights, which if elected by the noteholder, would reduce the required monthly payment. The limited conversion rights were subject to advance payment and volume conditions. The amendment also provided that the outstanding balance shall accrue interest at a rate of 8 and payment deferrals are no longer permitted under the 2022 Promissory Note. During the first quarter of 2024, we issued 336,550 shares of our common stock to the holder of the 2022 Promissory Note. These conversions were 
 23 

Table of Contents 

made pursuant to the terms of the amended 2022 Promissory Note. In addition, conversions were made in connection with the Company granting the holder additional conversion rights. As a result of the conversions, the 2022 Promissory Note has been paid-in-full. 
 On August 22, 2023, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park ), which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park up to 30.0 million in value of shares of our common stock from time to time over the 24-month term of the purchase agreement. Concurrently with entering into the purchase agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park pursuant to which the Company agreed to register the sale of the shares of the Company s common stock that have been and may be issued to Lincoln Park under the purchase agreement pursuant to the Company s existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares to Lincoln Park. On October 24, 2024, we terminated the common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park effective October 25, 2024. 
 On January 16, 2024, we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 800,000 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 950,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 7 million. The holders of the pre-funded warrants have exercised their rights to purchase all of the underlying common stock. 
 On January 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 1,096,000 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 24,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 5.6 million. The holders of the pre-funded warrants have exercised their rights to purchase all of the underlying common stock. 
 On February 9, 2024, we consummated a registered public offering of an aggregate of 800,000 shares of our common stock. We entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors, and as a result of the registered public offering, we raised gross proceeds of approximately 10 million. 
 On June 4, 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord Genuity LLC Canaccord ), as representative of certain agents, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to 120 million, through the agents. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 3,611,187 shares of our common stock under our At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with Wainwright and Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord for aggregate gross cash proceeds of approximately 22.2 million. Transaction costs were 0.7 million. From October 1, 2024 through the date of this Report, we sold additional shares of our common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement, as amended, with Canaccord for aggregate gross proceeds 81.1 million. On November 1, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord, as representative of certain agents, pursuant to which we increased the aggregate amount of shares of our common stock that we may sell under our at-the-market facility to an aggregate offering price of 171,520,779. As of the date of this Report, up to 70.8 million of shares of our common stock remain available for offer and sale pursuant to the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord. Refer to Note 10 Subsequent Events in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord. 
 Although we expect to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future, based on the financing events described above, management believes it has sufficient cash on hand for at least one year following the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of growth, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spend to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the market acceptance of our products and services. We believe that it is likely we will in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing, or issue securities under our effective registration statement described above. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and/or on acceptable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Operating Activities 
 The primary source of cash from operating activities is receipts from sales of our various product and service offerings to customers. The primary uses of cash from operating activities are payments to employees for compensation and related expenses, publishers and other vendors for the purchase of digital media inventory and related costs, sales and marketing expenses and general operating expenses. 
 We utilized 10.6 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a net loss of 7.7 million. The net loss included non-cash charges of 1.6 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation. In addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a cash decrease of 4.3 million, primarily relating to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and lease liability payments. 
 We utilized 15.9 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of 21.8 million. The net loss included non-cash charges of 9.0 million primarily related to an impairment of goodwill and stock-based compensation, offset by gain on the sale of digital assets. In addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a cash decrease of 1.7 million, primarily relating to a decrease in deferred revenue and lease liability payments. Further cash decreases were the result of 1.3 million from the discontinued operations of Lyte. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted mainly of the sales of our digital asset holdings. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of various sales of our common stock. 
 Our financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 6.9 million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock. We also had payments on our 2022 Promissory Note of 5.1 million and 0.5 million for repurchases of shares of our common stock. 
 Refer to the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on the Company's financing activities. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Information set forth in Note 6, Leases, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Through September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, solutions to be provided by the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain current and former officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of, or are related to, their status or service as directors, officers or employees.

 Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for analysis of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Except for the changes described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qual itative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying Officers (as defined below), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the design of information technology general controls ITGCs related to user access, program change and appropriate segregation of duties for certain IT applications. Further, as a result of cost cutting measures and headcount turnover in our accounting function, business process controls across the Company s financial reporting processes were not effectively designed and implemented due to a lack of segregation of duties between preparer and reviewer. 
 We are actively engaged in the implementation of a remediation plan to ensure that controls contributing to the material weakness described above are designed appropriately and will operate effectively. We implemented additional ITGCs to manage user access and program changes across our key systems. Further, we have implemented additional review controls to ensure proper segregation of duties in our financial reporting processes. However, on November 1, 2024, Troy Reisner, notified the Company he intends to step down as Chief Financial Officer and depart the Company on or after November 15, 2024 and prior to November 30, 2024. This may result in a delay in the completion of the implementation of this remediation plan. 
 Management believes that the remediation measures described above, if successfully implemented, will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness we have identified. However, the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the new controls are fully implemented, in operation for a sufficient period of time, tested and concluded by management to be designed and operating effectively. 
 Management is committed to continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our financial reporting controls and procedures. However, we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. Management will test, evaluate and audit the implementation of these new processes and internal controls to ascertain whether they are designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that they will prevent or detect a material error in the Company s financial statements. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in conjunction with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Certifying Officers, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent 
 27 

Table of Contents 

limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
