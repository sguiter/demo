Customer Deposits 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Corning had customer deposits of approximately billion. Most of these customer deposits were non-refundable and allowed customers to secure rights to products produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements, generally over a period of up to ten years. As products are delivered to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , customer deposits recognized were million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , customer deposits recognized were million and million, respectively.

 Deferred Revenue 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Corning had deferred revenue of approximately million and million, respectively. Deferred revenue was primarily related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by HSG from its customers under long-term supply agreements. 
 
 Deferred revenue is tracked on a per-customer contract-unit basis. As customers take delivery of the committed volumes under the terms of the contract, a per-unit amount of deferred revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer based upon the units delivered compared to the remaining contractual units. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the amount of deferred revenue recognized in the consolidated statements of (loss) income was not material.

of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation Dow Corning ). On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning. Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in Dow Corning. With the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow for of Dow Corning s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and limits. In January 2024, we entered into an agreement to settle the Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters and the settlement amount was not material. 
 
 Dow Corning Environmental Claims 
 
 Beginning in September 2019, Dow formally notified Corning of certain environmental matters for which Dow asserts that it has or will experience losses arising from remediation and response at a number of sites. Subject to certain conditions and limits, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow for up to of such losses. As of September 30, 2024 , Corning has determined a potential liability for these environmental matters is probable and the amount reserved was not material. 
 
 Environmental Litigation 
 
 Corning has been designated by federal or state governments under environmental laws, including Superfund, as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste sites. It is Corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to such hazardous waste sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Corning had accrued approximately million and million, respectively, for the estimated undiscounted liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company s liability.

Cross Currency Swap Contracts 
 
 Since inception of the Company s Japanese yen-denominated debt, the Japanese yen has weakened and the US dollar value of these liabilities has decreased, generating unrealized foreign exchange gains that have been recognized over time in the consolidated statements of (loss) income. In the second quarter of 2024, to economically lock in unrealized foreign exchange gains, the Company entered into a 23 billion, or million, fixed rate, three -year cross currency swap contract relating to a portion of the Company s Japanese yen-denominated debt due in 2027. At inception of this instrument, Corning received a net million from the counterparty, representing an exchange of the notional amounts at a fixed foreign exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollar and was initially recorded as a derivative liability. As of September 30, 2024 , the fair value of this derivative liability is million. 

Net Investment Hedges 
 
 In May 2023, the Company designated the full amount of its euro-denominated 2026 Notes and 2031 Notes with a total notional amount of 850 million, which are non-derivative financial instruments, as net investment hedges against our investments in certain European subsidiaries with euro functional currencies. As of September 30, 2024 , the net investment hedges are deemed to be effective. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , foreign currency losses of million and million, respectively, associated with these net investment hedges were recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).

The constant-currency rates established for our core performance measures are internally derived long-term management estimates, which are closely aligned with our hedging instrument rates. These hedging instruments may include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange forward or option contracts and foreign-denominated debt. The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand segment results without the volatility of currency fluctuation, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts. 
 
 Constant-currency rates used are as follows and are applied to all periods presented and to all foreign exchange exposures during the period, even though we may be less than 100 hedged: 
 
 Currency Japanese yen Korean won Chinese yuan New Taiwan dollar Euro Mexican peso 
 Rate 107 1,175 6.7 NT 31 0.81 MX 20 

In addition, certain income and expenses are excluded from segment net income (loss) and included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income (loss) to net (loss) income attributable to Corning Incorporated. These items are not used by the CODM in allocating resources or evaluating the results of the segments and include the following: the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt; the impact of the translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs; certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits; certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters; pension mark-to-market adjustments; and other non-recurring non-operational items. Although these amounts are excluded from segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results. 
 
 Corning s administrative and staff functions are performed on a centralized basis and such costs and expenses are allocated among the segments differently than they would be for stand-alone financial reporting purposes. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal, finance and supply chain management. Expenses that are not allocated to the segments are included in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income (loss) to net (loss) income attributable to Corning Incorporated. Segment net income (loss) may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

Forward-Looking Statements 

OVERVIEW 
 
 Corning is vital to progress. We are the world leaders in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics along with four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and we apply our capabilities to invent and make category-defining, highly engineered products; drive profitable and durable growth; and create long-term value. Today, our markets include optical communications, mobile consumer electronics, display, automotive, solar, semiconductor and life sciences. 
 
 Progress on our three-year Springboard plan 
 
 Springboard is our plan to add more than 3 billion in annualized core sales and to achieve a core operating margin of 20 by the end of 2026. We expect a number of upward cyclical factors and secular trends to drive growth across our Market-Access Platforms. As we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incremental profit and cash flow; we already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place, and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. With the success of the plan, we also expect to be able to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we continued making strong progress on Springboard - most notably in Display Technologies and Optical Communications. 

In Display Technologies, our Springboard plan is centered on maintaining stable U.S. dollar net income. To achieve this, we are raising glass prices. We expect that our price actions, in combination with the hedges we have in place through 2026, will deliver consistent profitability in the segment. In the segment, we expect to deliver segment net income of 900 to 950 million next year and to deliver segment net income margin of 25 , consistent with the last five years. We expect our price increases to offset the weaker yen in our hedges, and enable us to maintain the same profitability. Most importantly, we will continue to be the low-cost technology and market leader in Display. 

In Optical Communications, our Springboard plan is about revenue growth. When we introduced new Generative AI products in June of 2024, we said we expected to grow our Enterprise business at a 25 CAGR over the next four years, and strong demand for these products drove record Enterprise sales in the second and third quarter of 2024.

 Refer to Note 15 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net sales. 

Optical Communications 
 The increase in segment net sales for the three- and nine-month periods was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of AI-related connectivity solutions in our Enterprise business. Our Carrier business had an increase in volume in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in prior year as demand begins to recover. 
 
 Display Technologies 
 The increase in segment net sales for both the three- and nine-month periods was due to higher sales volume, attributable to increased panel maker utilization, as well as pricing actions taken in the second half of 2023 and currency-based price adjustments implemented in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Specialty Materials 
 Segment net sales for the three-month period slightly decreased as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in segment net sales for the nine-month period was due to continued strong demand for premium glass for mobile devices as well as semiconductor-related products. 
 
 Environmental Technologies 
 The decrease in segment net sales for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily due to a decline in heavy-duty diesel, reflecting the continued impact of the Class 8 truck downcycle in North America. 
 
 Life Sciences 
 The increase in segment net sales for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily due to increased demand as customers are completing their inventory drawdowns. 
 
 Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses 
 The decrease in segment net sales for the three-month period was primarily due to a decrease in our HSG business driven by lower pricing for solar-grade polysilicon, partially offset by an increase in our Automotive Glass Solutions business. The decrease in segment net sales for the nine-month period was primarily due to a decrease in our HSG business driven by lower pricing for solar-grade polysilicon and lower sales in our Pharmaceutical Technologies business due to the completion of volume commitments for COVID-related products.

 Refer to Note 15 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to net (loss) income attributable to Corning Incorporated. 

Optical Communications 
 The increase in segment net income for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily driven by strong incremental profit on higher sales volume, as outlined above. 
 
 Display Technologies 
 The increase in segment net income for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily driven by the increase in sales, as outlined above. 
 
 Specialty Materials 
 Segment net income for the three-month period was flat with the prior year. The increase in segment net income for the nine-month period was primarily driven by the increase in sales, as outlined above, and manufacturing improvements. 
 
 Environmental Technologies 
 The decrease in segment net income for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily driven by the decrease in sales, as outlined above. 
 
 Life Sciences 
 The increase in segment net income for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily driven by profitability improvements from productivity actions taken. 
 
 Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses 
 The decrease in segment net income for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily driven by our HSG and Pharmaceutical Technologies businesses due to lower sales, as outlined above.

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
 
 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures included in our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at our core performance measures. These items include the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt, the impact of the translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits, certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect the ongoing operating results of the Company. 
 
 In addition, because a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, management utilizes constant-currency reporting for the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment. In addition, effective January 1, 2024, the Company began utilizing constant-currency reporting for the Optical Communications segment to exclude the impact from the Mexican peso on segment results. Prior periods were not recast as the impact was not material. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen exposure within the Display Technologies segment. 
 
 The constant-currency rates established for our core performance measures are internally derived long-term management estimates, which are closely aligned with our hedging instrument rates. These hedging instruments may include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange forward or option contracts and foreign-denominated debt. For details of the rates used, please see the footnotes to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures section. We believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts. 
 
 Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We provide investors with these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our results as we believe they are indicative of our core operating performance and provide greater transparency to how management evaluates our results and trends and makes financial and operational decisions. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because management does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of management s control. As a result, management is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis. 
 
 For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.

Core Net Sales 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated core net sales of 3.7 billion compared to 3.5 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase in core net sales of 274 million was primarily driven by increased segment sales of 328 million in Optical Communications and 43 million in Display Technologies, partially offset by decreased segment sales of 67 million in Environmental Technologies and 29 million in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Net sales by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are discussed in detail in the Segment Analysis section of our MD A. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated core net sales of 10.6 billion compared to 10.3 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase in core net sales of 287 million was primarily driven by increased segment sales of 238 million in Display Technologies, 180 million in Optical Communications and 111 million in Specialty Materials, partially offset by decreased segment sales of 185 million in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses and 69 million in Environmental Technologies. Net sales by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are discussed in detail in the Segment Analysis section of our MD A. 
 
 Core Net Income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated core net income of 465 million compared to 386 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 79 million was primarily due to higher segment net income of 84 million in Optical Communications and 43 million in Display Technologies, partially offset by lower segment net income of 24 million in Environmental Technologies. Net income by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are discussed in detail in the Segment Analysis section of our MD A. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated core net income of 1.2 billion compared to 1.1 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase of 78 million was primarily due to higher segment net income of 134 million in Display Technologies, 35 million in Specialty Materials and 28 million in Optical Communications, offset by lower segment net income of 79 million in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Net income by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are discussed in detail in the Segment Analysis section of our MD A.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
 We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of (loss) income or statements of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of (loss) income or statements of cash flows. 
 
 Core net sales, core net income and core earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in our operations. 
 
 The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share amounts):

Table of Contents 

Items Adjusted from GAAP Measures 
 
 Items adjusted from GAAP measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows: 

(1) 
 Constant-currency adjustment : As a significant portion of revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. The Company utilizes constant-currency reporting for Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment. In addition, effective January 1, 2024, the Company began utilizing constant-currency reporting for the Optical Communications segment to exclude the impact from the Mexican peso on segment results. Prior periods were not recast as the impact was not material. The constant-currency rates established for our core performance measures are internally derived long-term management estimates, which are closely aligned with our hedging instrument rates. These hedging instruments may include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange forward or option contracts and foreign-denominated debt. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the adjustment primarily relates to our Japanese yen exposure due to the difference in the average spot rate compared to our core rate. We believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuation, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts. Constant-currency rates used are as follows and are applied to all periods presented and to all foreign exchange exposures during the period, even though we may be less than 100 hedged: 

Currency 
 
 Japanese yen 
 
 Korean won 
 
 Chinese yuan 
 
 New Taiwan dollar 
 
 Euro 
 
 Mexican peso 

Rate 
 
 107 
 
 1,175 
 
 6.7 
 
 NT 31 
 
 0.81 
 
 MX 20 

(2) 
 Translation of Japanese yen-denominated debt, net : Amount reflects the gain or loss on the translation of our yen-denominated debt to U.S. dollars, net of a 10 million and 3 million gain, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to the change in the fair value of our cross currency swap contracts. 

(3) 
 Translated earnings contract : Amount reflects the impact of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro and New Taiwan dollar-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, as well as the unrealized gains and losses of our British pound and Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings. 

(4) 
 Acquisition-related costs : Amount reflects intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs, as well as other transaction related costs. 

(5) 
 Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments : Amount reflects certain discrete period tax items such as changes in tax law, the impact of tax audits, changes in tax reserves and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, as well as other tax-related adjustments. 

(6) 
 Restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits : Amount reflects certain restructuring, impairment losses and other charges and credits, as well as other expenses, including severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and facility repairs resulting from power outages, and the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments upon the substantial liquidation of a foreign entity, which are not related to ongoing operations. 

(7) 
 Pension mark-to-market adjustment : Amount primarily reflects defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates. 

(8) 
 Loss (gain) on investments : Amount reflects the loss or gain recognized on investments due to mark-to-market adjustments for the change in fair value or the disposition of an investment. 

(9) 
 Loss (gain) on sale of assets : Amount represents the loss or gain recognized for the sale of assets. 

(10) 
 Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters : Amount reflects developments in commercial litigation, intellectual property disputes, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our financial condition and liquidity are strong. We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix of such resources. 
 
 Our major sources of funding for 2024 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and meet our obligations for the foreseeable future. Such obligations may include requirements for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchases. We will continue to generate cash from operations and maintain access to our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as discussed in more detail below. 
 
 Key Balance Sheet Data 
 
 We fund our working capital with cash from operations and, periodically, short-term and long-term borrowings. In addition, from time to time, we receive upfront cash from customers relating to long-term supply agreements, as well as cash incentives from government entities generally for capital expansion and related expenses.

We perform comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments to identify potential customer credit issues. We are not aware of any customer credit issues that could have a material impact on our liquidity. 
 
 We participate in accounts receivable management programs, including factoring arrangements to sell certain accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions or accelerate collections through our customer s supply chain financing arrangements. Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. By utilizing these types of programs, we have accelerated the collection of 380 million, 389 million and 267 million of accounts receivable during the three months ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. We believe these accounts receivable would have been collected during the normal course of business in the following quarter.

 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 improved by 233 million when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower capital expenditures of 400 million, partially offset by 67 million in proceeds from the sale of equipment in the prior period and 31 million less realized gains on our translated earnings contracts. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 424 million when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by the 918 million in proceeds from the issuance of euro-denominated notes in 2023, partially offset by 507 million in payments for the redemption of preferred stock in 2023 and 135 million in purchases of common stock in 2024 compared to no repurchases in 2023.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 51 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, Corning had approximately 1.4 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes. We do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings for which we asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested. 
 
 Debt Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity 
 
 We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 1.5 billion. Under this program, we may issue commercial paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have outstanding commercial paper. 
 
 Our 1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, if needed. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. 

35

Table of Contents 

Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60 . As of September 30, 2024, our leverage using this measure was approximately 39 . As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance. 
 
 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default exceeding a specified amount on one debt obligation, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such provisions.

 Uses of Cash 
 
 Share Repurchase Agreement 
 
 Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement SRA with Samsung Display Co., Ltd.

Corning may, at its sole discretion, elect to repurchase such common shares.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the liability associated with this option, measured using Level 2 inputs, was not material.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates that are considered by management to be the most critical to the understanding of the consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since the date of the Company s most recent Annual Report, there were no material changes in the Company s critical accounting estimates or assumptions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As noted in the 2023 Form 10-K, we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects: 

Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and 

Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 

For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risk and how we mitigate that risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks, contained in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of Corning s management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. Corning s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning s management, including Corning s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 An evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting was performed to determine whether any changes have occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that there was no change in Corning s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations, is remote. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in Corning s 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially impact the Company s business, financial condition or future results. Risks disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may materially adversely impact Corning s business, financial condition or operating results.
