Holders of Class A shares and Class B shares vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by the A R LLC Agreement. We do not intend to list the Class B shares on any stock exchange. As of September 30, 2024, all of our Class B shares are owned by LandBridge Holdings.

RSUs issued to participants are recorded on grant date at fair value. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award) as either other operating and maintenance expense or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Therefore, compensation cost previously recognized for an award that is forfeited because of failure to satisfy a service condition will be reversed in the period of the forfeiture. RSUs include dividend equivalent rights that permit holders of granted but unvested RSUs to receive nonforfeitable distributions alongside common equity holders of the Company as if such RSUs were granted as of the applicable record date for such distribution.

 million of deferred tax assets included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded income tax benefit of million and income tax expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded income tax benefit of million and income tax expense of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon currently known facts and circumstances and applies that rate to its year-to-date earnings or losses. The Company s effective tax rate is based on expected income and statutory tax rates and takes into consideration permanent differences between financial statement and tax return income applicable to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effect of discrete items, such as changes in estimates, changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status, and unusual or infrequently occurring events, is recognized in the interim period in which the discrete item occurs. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or as the result of new judicial interpretations or regulatory or tax law changes. The Company s interim effective tax rate, inclusive of any discrete items, was for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the noncontrolling interest adjustment as the income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is pass-through income. Our predecessor, OpCo, is a Delaware limited liability company treated as a partnership, or, prior to the offering, a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, has not been subject to U.S. federal income tax at an entity level. As a result, the consolidated net income (loss) in our historical financial statements does not reflect the tax expense (benefit) we would have incurred if we were subject to U.S. federal income tax at an entity level during the periods prior to the Offering. OpCo continues to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to members, including the Company, and, except for Texas franchise tax, any taxable income of OpCo is reported in the respective tax returns of its members. OpCo recorded million related to its Texas margin tax liability as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which is included within other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company had no activity or holdings prior to the Offering.

Interest on all outstanding base rate loans shall be payable on the first day of each calendar quarter. Our Credit Facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries, which are party to our Credit Facilities as guarantors. Subject to certain exceptions and materiality qualifiers, our Credit Facilities include certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, which, among other things, restrict our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur debt, grant liens, make restricted payments and investments, issue equity, sell or lease assets, dissolve or merge with another entity, enter into transactions with affiliates or restrictive agreements, change our business, prepay debt and amend our organizational documents and material agreements. Our Credit Facilities allow us to make cash dividends to our shareholders so long as (i) no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom, (ii) the pro forma leverage ratio is less than :1.00 and (iii) pro forma liquidity is at least million . In addition, we are required to comply with the following financial maintenance covenants: (i) a maximum leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of (a) prior to the consummation of the Offering, no greater than :1.00 for the period of the last four consecutive fiscal quarters, or (b) following the consummation of the Offering, :1.00 for the period of the last four consecutive fiscal quarters (subject, in either case, to (x) a :1.00 leverage step-up for any qualified acquisition for the fiscal quarter in which such qualified acquisition occurs and the immediately following two fiscal quarters, at the Company s election, (y) cap of :1.00 on such step-up regardless of the total number of qualified acquisitions and certain other limitations set forth therein, and (z) an additional step up of for the second quarter of 2024 in connection with consummation of the East Stateline Acquisition; (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after the date of the closing of the Offering; and (iii) a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to the date on which the Offering is consummated. Our Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, including for our failure and the failure of other loan parties to comply with the various financial, negative and affirmative covenants under our Credit Facilities (subject to the cure provisions set forth therein). During the existence of an event of default (as defined under our Credit Facilities), the agent, with the consent of or at the direction of the requisite lenders thereunder, has a right to, among other available remedies, terminate the commitments and/or declare all outstanding loans and accrued interest and fees under our Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable. The principal outstanding amount of the Credit Facilities approximates the estimated fair value because the interest rates applicable to such amounts are variable and reflective of market rates and the debt may be repaid, in full or in part, at any time without penalty.

 Overview 
 Land is critical to energy development and production. Access to expansive surface acreage is necessary for oil and natural gas development, solar power generation, power storage, data centers and non-hazardous oilfield reclamation and solid waste facilities. Further, the significant industrial economy that exists to service and support energy development requires access to surface acreage to support those activities. These dynamics drove our acquisition and ownership of approximately 221,000 surface acres in Texas and New Mexico located in and around the Delaware sub-basin of the prolific Permian Basin, which is among the most economic, liquids-rich hydrocarbon resources in the United States. Our strategy is to actively manage our land and resources to support and encourage oil and natural gas development and other land uses that will generate long-term revenue and Free Cash Flow for us and returns to our shareholders. 
 We take an active approach to the commercial development of our land, seeking to maximize the long-term value of our surface acreage and our resources by identifying and seeking commercial partners looking to invest in developing and operating long-term assets within and beyond the oil and gas value chain on our land. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 11.5 million and 40.5 million, respectively, of non-oil and gas royalty revenue, or 159 and 562, respectively, per owned surface acre. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we increased non-oil and gas royalty revenue to 25.6 million and 61.9 million, respectively, or 116 and 409, respectively, per owned surface acre. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the effects of the Acquisitions beginning on March 18, 2024, in the case of the Lea County Acquisition, and May 10, 2024, in the case of the May 2024 Acquisitions. We measure our revenue divided by our total acreage as a performance metric, which we refer to as surface use economic efficiency. Further, we are actively pursuing additional revenue streams beyond the hydrocarbon value chain to maximize utilization of our land and resources. We have entered into, or are currently pursuing, primarily long-term commercial relationships with businesses focused on solar power generation, power storage, cryptocurrency mining and data management, as well as other renewable energy production, among other industries and applications. Similar to the other operations conducted on our land, we expect to enter into surface use or similar agreements with the owners of these projects from which we expect to receive surface use fees and other payments in connection with the utilization of our land, but we do not expect to own or operate such projects or expect to incur significant capital expenditures in connection therewith.

We share a financial sponsor, Five Point, and our management team with WaterBridge. WaterBridge is one of the largest water midstream companies in the United States and operates a large-scale network of pipelines and other infrastructure in the Delaware Basin that, as of September 30, 2024, handles approximately 2.3 million bpd of water associated with oil and natural gas production, with approximately 3.4 million bpd of total handling capacity. WaterBridge operates primarily under long-term agreements with E P companies to provide critical produced water handling throughout the full life cycle of its customers oil and natural gas wells. These relationships provide our shared management team visibility into key areas of oil and natural gas production and long-term trends, which we leverage to encourage and support the development of critical infrastructure on our land and generate additional revenue for us. As of September 30, 2024, WaterBridge has constructed or acquired approximately 0.6 million bpd of water handling capacity on our land, with approximately 1.5 million bpd of permitted capacity available for future development on our land. We receive royalties for each barrel of produced water that WaterBridge handles on our land as well as surface use payments for infrastructure constructed on our land.

 Commercial Developments 
 On November 6, 2024, we entered into a lease development agreement for the development of a data center and related facilities on approximately 2,000 acres of our land in Reeves County, Texas. The counterparty to the agreement is a joint venture between a third-party developer and funds affiliated with our financial sponsor, Five Point Energy LLC. The lease development agreement includes, among other things, a non-refundable 8.0 million deposit due in December 2024 for a two-year site selection and pre-development period. The counterparty is obligated to meet certain timing milestones to maintain its lease, to include the commencement of site development within a two-year period and construction of the data center within a subsequent four-year period. Upon initiation of construction of a data center, the counterparty will make escalating annual lease payments along with additional payments based on 
 29 

net revenue received with respect to the power generation facilities to be located on the leased property. Approval of the lease development agreement and related transactions were referred to an independent Conflicts Committee of the Company s Board of Directors for approval. 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a third-party private seller to acquire approximately 5,800 surface acres in Lea County, New Mexico, for a total purchase price of 26.5 million. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Market Condition and Outlook 
 Over the last several years, the global economy, and more specifically the oil and natural gas industry, has experienced significant volatility, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery, the Russia-Ukraine war and the related sanctions imposed on Russia, as well as the Israel-Hamas conflict and heightened tensions in the Middle East, domestic political uncertainty, the activities of OPEC, a potential economic recession and elevated inflation, interest rates and costs of capital and industry consolidation. More recently, high levels of activity in the Delaware Basin have resulted in labor and supply chain challenges, which has impacted drilling, completion and production activity. This volatility has driven material swings in WTI pricing, which has subsequently impacted development and production decisions of E P companies. 
 Despite these challenges, we believe the outlook for the oil and natural gas industry, particularly within the Permian Basin, remains positive. Within the Delaware Basin, the most active sub-region within the Permian Basin, oil production increased at a CAGR of 23 from 2016 through the first half of 2024, while water production increased at a CAGR of 21 during the same period. According to Enverus, as of September 30, 2024, there were 170 active drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin, and further, according to the EIA, oil production in the Permian Basin is expected to average 6.3 million bpd in 2024, which is higher than the average daily production of any prior year in the Permian Basin. The EIA expects this growth to continue into 2025 with the Permian Basin increasing oil production by an additional 230,000 bpd. This drilling activity requires significant build out of related infrastructure in the region and access to surface acreage to support such operations. 
 In addition to positive momentum within the oil and natural gas industry, we expect to benefit from advancements in clean energy alternatives. In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA contains hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, amongst other provisions. While these incentives could further accelerate the transition of the U.S. economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, like oil and natural gas, clean energy technologies often require access to material surface acreage and supporting infrastructure, which we are well positioned to facilitate. 
 Third Quarter Results 
 Significant financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2024 include: 
 Revenues of 28.5 million, an increase of 60 as compared to the third quarter of 2023; 

Net loss of 2.8 million as compared to net income of 16.6 million in the third quarter of 2023; 

Net loss margin of 10 as compared to net income margin of 93 in the third quarter of 2023; 

Adjusted EBITDA (1) of 25.0 million, an increase of 62 as compared with the third quarter of 2023; 

Adjusted EBITDA Margin (1) of 88 , an increase of 1 as compared with the third quarter of 2023; 

Cash flow from operating activities of 7.5 million, a decrease of 54 as compared to the third quarter of 2023; 

Free Cash Flow (1) of 7.1 million, a decrease of 55 as compared to the third quarter of 2023; 

Operating cash flow margin of 26 , a decrease of 65 as compared to the third quarter of 2023; and 

Free Cash Flow Margin (1) of 25 , a decrease of 65 as compared to the third quarter 2023; 

(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for more information regarding these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. See also How We Evaluate Our Operations for more information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin. 
 Net loss and net loss margin for the third quarter of 2024 include non-cash share-based compensation expense of 11.6 million, of which 1.8 million is attributable to RSUs issued by the Company and 9.8 million is attributable to Incentive Units issued by LandBridge Holdings. Net income and net income margin for the third quarter of 2023 include non-cash share-based compensation income of 6.9 million attributable to the NDB Incentive Units. Subsequent to the Offering, any actual cash expense associated with such Incentive Units is borne solely by LandBridge Holdings and not the Company. Distributions attributable to Incentive Units are based on returns received by investors of LandBridge Holdings once certain return threshold have been met and are neither an obligation of the Company nor taken into consideration for distributions to investors in the Company. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 Share-Based Compensation to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding Incentive Units.

How We Generate Revenue 
 We generate revenue from multiple sources, including the use of our surface acreage, the sale of resources from our land and oil and gas and mineral royalties. The fees, royalty rates, payment structure and other related terms in our contracts are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the surface use of our land, the type of resources extracted, the amount of use expected to be made of our land, and the amount of resources to be produced and/or extracted. In any given period, the amount and sources of revenues we receive from any particular customer can fluctuate based on the nature, timing and scope of such customer s activities on our land. For example, during the initial phase of a customer s activities on our land, we would generally expect to receive usage-based fees and revenues under our surface use royalty agreements SURAs and surface use agreements SUAs related to installation of infrastructure necessary to support long-term operations. Over time, these revenues would generally be expected to migrate to royalty revenue and resource sales based on such customer s use of our land and resources. Our revenue consists of the principal components discussed below. 
 Surface Use Royalties and Revenues 
 Surface Use Royalties . We enter into SURAs and certain overarching SUAs with operators that require royalty payments to us based on a percentage of the customer s gross revenues derived from use of our land and/or volumetric use of infrastructure installed on our land in exchange for rights of use of our land. Our SURAs typically obligate the operator to meter its volumetric utilization of infrastructure installed on our land and to include a report of such utilization for our review along with its periodic payment. Royalties we receive from operations under our SURAs include produced water transportation and handling operations, skim oil recovery and produced water throughput and waste reclamation. Our SURAs generally have terms ranging from a minimum of five years to 10 years and impose only nominal obligations on us. As of September 30, 2024: (i) produced water royalties under our SURAs ranged from 0.10 per barrel to 0.25 per barrel; and (ii) skim oil royalties under our SURAs ranged from 15 to 50 of net proceeds. However, the terms of our SURAs are negotiated on a customer-by-customer basis. Our SURAs typically do not include minimum purchase or use commitments by our customers but do generally provide for automatic renewal-based increases in royalties that are tied to the Consumer Price Index CPI or are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, depending on a number of factors, such as general economic conditions, the surface use of our land, competitor pricing and/or customer specific considerations. Our contractual provisions providing for inflation escalators are generally based on CPI or a specified fixed percentage, which may limit the amount of any single pricing increase. Such provisions may also vary as to the commencement date of such increases and the timing and calculation of the applicable adjustment based on the term of the agreement or particular use of our land. Our SURAs generally include standard provisions relating to maintenance by our customers of insurance of specified types and amounts, environmental, health and safety covenants and indemnification of us for the unauthorized use of hazardous material or environmental claims. 
 Easements and other surface-related income . SUAs permit operators to install drilling sites, pipelines, roadways, electric lines and other facilities and equipment on land owned by us. We typically receive a per-rod or per-acre fee when the contract is executed, based on the aggregate amount of our land that is utilized under such SUA, and we often receive additional fees at the beginning of each renewal period or on a monthly or annual basis. Such agreements typically include pre-defined terms for fees that we will receive for our customers development and use of drilling sites, new and existing roads, pipeline easements and electric transmission easements. Our SUAs generally require our customers to use the resources from our land, such as brackish water and sand, for their operations on our land, for which we receive our customary fees. Our SUAs generally have terms ranging from a minimum of five years to 10 years, with early termination rights for non-use over a pre-determined period of time, typically 12 to 18 months. Beyond making our land available in accordance with our SUAs, our SUAs impose only nominal obligations on us. As of September 30, 2024: (i) standard pipeline easements ranged from 20 per rod to 450 per rod based, in part, on the diameter of the pipeline and the easement term; (ii) road easements for new roads ranged from 75 per rod to 150 per rod based, in part, on the easement term; (iii) utility line easements ranged from 20 per rod to 150 per rod based, in part, on capacity and width of the utility line and the easement term; and (iv) well pads ranged from 7,000 per acre to 12,000 per acre. However, the terms of our SUAs are negotiated on a customer-by-customer basis. Our SUAs typically do not include minimum commitments with respect to the type and amount of infrastructure to be installed on our property or the amount of revenue to be received by us, but do generally provide for automatic renewal-based increases in royalties that are tied to the CPI or negotiated on a case-by-case basis, depending on a number of factors, such as general economic conditions, the surface use of our land, competitor pricing and/or customer specific considerations. Our contractual provisions providing for inflation escalators are generally based on CPI or a specified fixed percentage, which may limit the amount of any single pricing increase. Such provisions may also vary as to the commencement date of such increases and the timing and calculation of the applicable adjustment based on the term of the agreement or particular use of our land. Our SUAs generally include standard provisions relating to maintenance by our customers of insurance of specified types and amounts, environmental, health and safety covenants and indemnification of us for environmental claims. 
 31 

Resource Sales and Royalties 
 Resource Sales . Resource sales generally include brackish water to be used primarily in well completions in exchange for a per barrel fee, which is negotiated and varies depending on the destination of the brackish water. We have strong relationships with, and contractual commitments from, many of the E P companies in the Stateline Position. Additionally, the immediate proximity of our Stateline Position to the Texas-New Mexico state border provides us the ability to deliver brackish water volumes into the otherwise constrained market in New Mexico. Similarly, our customers buy other surface composite materials from us for the construction of access roads and well pads for which we receive a fixed-fee per cubic yard extracted from our surface acreage. Our agreements related to the sale of resources generally have terms ranging from a minimum of five years to 10 years, with early termination rights for non-use over a pre-determined period of time, typically 12 to 18 months. As of September 30, 2024: (i) per barrel prices for brackish water sold to third parties on a spot basis ranged from 0.50 to 1.10; (ii) per barrel prices for brackish water sold to oil and gas producers ranged from 0.35 to 0.95; (iii) per barrel prices for brackish water sold to resellers for delivery into New Mexico ranged from 0.15 to 0.35; and (iv) prices for caliche ranged from 5 per cubic yard to 10 per cubic yard. Such agreements may include certain exclusivity rights, such as the exclusive right to require the purchase of the subject resource for any operations on our land, and may include minimum commitments that are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the amount of activity on our land, the specific use of our land and any resultant production thereon, among other things. These agreements typically provide rights to monitor activities on our land and contain standard provisions relating to confidentiality, indemnification of us for environmental claims and maintenance of insurance of specified types and amounts. 
 Resource Royalties . We lease our surface acreage to customers to construct and operate at their expense brackish water wells and sand mines to provide in-basin water and sand for use in oil and natural gas completion operations. Such customers hold the exclusive right to the water and sand they extract from the leased surface acreage and may be required to make minimum royalty payments as a result. The agreements pursuant to which we receive resource royalties have varying primary terms of at least one year, and contain rights for renewal so long as the customer continues to operate on our land. We typically receive a fee when the contract is executed and a fixed royalty per barrel of water or ton of sand extracted. In situations where our customers do not operate brackish water wells on our surface but require the use of water for their operations, they generally must acquire such water from us for our customary fee. Such fees are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, depending on a number of factors, such as general economic conditions, the type of resources extracted, the amount of use expected to be made of our land or the amount of resources to be produced and/or extracted, competitor pricing and/or customer specific considerations. As of September 30, 2024, resource royalties received per ton of sand extracted ranged from 2.00 to 3.00, subject to certain minimum payment obligations, and resource royalties received per barrel of brackish water extracted ranged from 0.15 to 0.40. These leases generally do not impose minimum production requirements on our customers. These lease agreements contain standard provisions relating to confidentiality, indemnification of us for the unauthorized use of hazardous material or environmental claims and maintenance of insurance of specified types and amounts. 
 Oil and Gas Royalties 
 Oil and Gas Royalties . Oil and gas royalties are received in connection with oil and natural gas mineral interests owned by us. Oil and gas royalties are recognized as revenue as oil and gas are produced or severed from the mineral lease. The oil and gas royalties we receive are dependent upon market prices for oil and natural gas, and producer specific location and contractual price differences. Oil and gas royalties also include mineral lease bonus revenues. We receive lease bonus revenue by leasing our mineral interests to E P companies. When we execute a mineral lease contract, the lease generally transfers the rights to any oil or natural gas discovered to the E P company and grants us the right to a specified royalty interest payable on future production. Mineral lease bonuses are nonrefundable. Royalties from oil and natural gas production are generally negotiated on a case-by-case basis, depending on the particular mineral interests and holder of such mineral interests. 
 32 

We expect our fee-based revenues to grow over time relative to our oil and gas royalties. While our focus is on fee-based arrangements, our oil and gas royalties fluctuate with market prices for oil and natural gas. The following table presents the amount and relative percentage of each component of our revenues for the following periods:

Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of the activity level of producers on and around our land, the development of new revenue streams, commodity prices, changes in volumes produced on our land and our acquisition strategy, among other things, and are significantly dependent on our customers activities on and around our land. For example, oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. Lower commodity prices may decrease our revenues as customers on and around our land decrease their activity levels in response to low commodity prices. Although we intend to pursue additional opportunities to increase our revenue streams and introduce additional revenue components, including through solar power generation, power storage and battery projects, water treatment and desalination facilities, fueling stations, data centers, telecommunication towers and equipment and other opportunities, there can be no assurance that such revenue streams will materially diversify our revenue streams. 
 33 

Costs of Conducting our Business 
 Our costs consist primarily of resource sales-related expenses, other operating and maintenance expenses to maintain our surface acreage and general administrative expenses. Our principal costs are as follows: 
 Resource Sales-Related Expenses . Resource sales-related expenses are costs incurred for utilization and maintenance of our assets and facilities in the extraction or production of resources available on our land that are sold by us. These costs generally include utilities to operate our facilities and assets and repairs and maintenance expenses related to those assets. 
 Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses . Operating and maintenance expenses are costs incurred for maintaining our surface acreage and other assets, including field operating overhead and supervision, production taxes, insurance costs, ad valorem and property taxes, and repairs and maintenance expense. 
 General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses include a corporate shared services allocation from WaterBridge, directly incurred corporate costs and share-based compensation expense. Corporate shared services generally include the cost of shared management and administrative services. The corporate shared service allocation is based on an approximation of time spent on activities supporting us as well as by underlying business activities. The shared service allocation expense is reimbursed to WaterBridge through our shared services agreement. Direct corporate costs are incurred for direct corporate employees, including payroll, benefits and other employee-related expenses of our direct corporate staff, professional services that generally consist of audit, tax, legal and valuation services and expenses for corporate insurance policies. 
 Prior to the Offering, share-based compensation expense only included expense allocated to us for NDB LLC s Incentive Unit plan. The NDB Incentive Unit awards were classified as liability awards by NDB LLC and required periodic remeasurement. On July 1, 2024, in accordance with the Division, the holders of the NDB Incentive Units were issued an identical number of Incentive Units at LandBridge Holdings. As of the date of the Division, the Incentive Units held at LandBridge Holdings are the only incentive units attributable and allocated to the Company. The Incentive Units are accounted for as a modification and have been transitioned to equity award accounting and, as such, do not require periodic remeasurements. The share-based compensation for the Incentive Units is fully allocated to the noncontrolling interest as the contractual obligation to satisfy the Incentive Units exists at LandBridge Holdings. Subsequent to the Offering, any actual cash expense associated with such Incentive Units is borne solely by LandBridge Holdings and not the Company. 
 In connection with the Offering, our Board adopted the LTIP. The LTIP allows for the grant of options, SARs, RSUs, share awards, dividend equivalents, other share-based awards, cash awards, substitute awards or any combination thereof. Under the LTIP, participants have been granted RSUs. Share-based compensation associated with RSUs is allocated between the Company and the noncontrolling interest based on relative ownership. Substantially all share-based compensation is included in general and administrative expense (income) with an immaterial amount included in other operating and maintenance expense on the unaudited condensed statements of operations prior to allocation to the noncontrolling interest. See Note 8 Share-Based Compensation to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding share-based compensation. 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our business. 
 Revenue 
 Revenue is a key performance metric of our company. We analyze realized monthly, quarterly and annual revenues and compare the results against our internal projections and budgets. Results are used to validate, or when applicable update, existing assumptions on macroeconomic drivers of our business, contractual mix driving average unit-level revenues and E P customer development activity and commodity pricing, absent the impact of our operating costs. 
 Surface Use Economic Efficiency 
 We calculate surface use economic efficiency as (i) total revenues less oil and gas royalty revenues divided by (ii) owned surface acreage or in periods in which we acquire or dispose of acreage, the weighted average surface acreage owned during the period. This metric provides valuable insight into the effectiveness of our active land management strategy by examining our ability to generate value on our owned surface and track trends of our results over time, while inherently adjusting for any surface acreage acquisitions or divestitures that may occur. Further, we believe this metric serves as a worthwhile benchmark of our team s management and growth strategy, as well as the relative value of our surface acreage, compared to our peers. 
 34 

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, research analysts and others, to assess the financial performance of our assets over the long term to generate sufficient cash to return capital to equity holders or service indebtedness. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest; taxes; depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion; share-based compensation; non-recurring transaction-related expenses and other non-cash or non-recurring expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues. 
 Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period, and against our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Please read Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin 
 Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, research analysts and others, to assess our ability to repay our indebtedness, return capital to our shareholders and fund potential acquisitions without access to external sources of financing for such purposes. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operating activities less investment in capital expenditures. We define Free Cash Flow Margin as Free Cash Flow divided by total revenues. 
 Management believes Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are useful because they allow for an effective evaluation of both our operating and financial performance, as well as the capital intensity of our business, and subsequently the ability of our operations to generate cash flow that is available to distribute to our shareholders, reduce leverage or support acquisition activities. Please read Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations 
 In this Quarterly Report, we present our historical results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our future results of operations will not be directly comparable to the historical results of operations of our predecessor for the periods presented as a result of the significant growth of our business and new contracting activity completed during each year of our operation, which are not reflected in our operating results until such contracting activity has been completed. We have also experienced additional significant growth in our business following the completion of the Acquisitions, resulting in our future results of operations for periods following the consummation of such Acquisitions to not be directly comparable with our historical results. 
 Public Company Costs 
 As a result of the Offering, we incurred incremental, non-recurring costs related to our transition to a publicly traded and taxable entity, including the costs of the Offering and the costs associated with the initial implementation of our Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal controls and testing. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional significant and recurring expenses as a publicly traded company, including costs associated with SEC reporting and compliance requirements, consisting of the preparation and filing of annual and quarterly reports, registrar and transfer agent fees, national stock exchange fees, audit fees, legal fees, investor relations expenses, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director and officer compensation expenses. These expenses are not included in our results of operations prior to the Offering. Additionally, we have hired additional employees and consultants, including accounting and legal personnel, in order to comply with the requirements of being a publicly traded company. 
 Corporate Reorganization 
 We were formed to serve as the issuer in the Offering and have no previous operations, assets or liabilities. The historical consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report are based on the financial statements of our accounting predecessor, OpCo, prior to the Corporate Reorganization in connection with the Offering. As a result, the historical consolidated financial data may not give you an accurate indication of what our actual results would have been if the Corporate Reorganization had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented or of what our future results of operations are likely to be. See Recent Developments Corporate Reorganization . 
 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
 In order to incentivize individuals providing services to us or our affiliates, our Board adopted a long-term incentive plan LTIP for employees and directors. Any individual who is our officer or employee or an officer or employee of any of our affiliates, and any other person who provides services to us or our affiliates, including our directors, may be eligible to receive awards under the LTIP at

the discretion of our Board or a committee thereof, as applicable. The LTIP provides for the grant, from time to time, at the discretion of our Board, or a committee thereof, of options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, share awards, dividend equivalents, other share-based awards, cash awards, substitute awards and performance awards intended to align the interests of employees, directors and service providers with those of our shareholders. As such, our historical financial data may not present an accurate indication of what our actual results would have been if we had implemented the LTIP program prior to the periods presented within. 
 Acquisitions 
 In the first half of 2024, we acquired approximately 150,000 surface acres through the consummation of the Acquisitions, which will impact the comparability of our results of operations. See Note 3 Asset Acquisitions within the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to the Acquisitions. We expect to pursue opportunistic future land acquisitions that compliment or expand our current land position, which may impact the comparability of our results. 
 Credit Facility 
 On July 3, 2023, we entered into our credit facility which initially provided for (i) a four-year 100.0 million term loan facility Term Loan and (ii) a four-year 50.0 million revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility ), each of which matures on July 3, 2027. In connection with entering into our credit facility, we borrowed 100.0 million under the Term Loan and borrowed 25.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. Net proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay the 49.4 million outstanding under our prior credit facility, and to make a distribution of 72.9 million to NDB LLC. On May 10, 2024, in order to fund a portion of the purchase price for each of the Acquisitions, we entered into the Credit Agreement Amendment, which amended the credit facility. Among other things, the Credit Agreement Amendment increased the four-year Term Loan to 350.0 million and the four-year Revolving Credit Facility to 75.0 million. Following our entry into the Credit Agreement Amendment, we borrowed 265.0 million under our credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase price of each of the Acquisitions. On November 4, 2024, we entered into the Second Credit Agreement Amendment to increase the maximum available amount under our Revolving Credit Facility to 100.0 million, increase the principal amount of the Term Loan to 300.0 million, with an additional 75.0 million uncommitted delayed draw term loan, and eliminate the Company s obligation to make Term Loan amortization payments. Our credit facility is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all assets and guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Instruments Credit Facility for more information. 
 Income Taxes 
 Prior to the Offering, OpCo and its subsidiaries were primarily entities that were treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes but were subject to certain minimal Texas franchise taxes. One of our subsidiaries is a qualified REIT for federal income tax purposes. There is no tax imposed on a REIT as long as the REIT complies with the applicable tax rules and avails itself of the opportunity to reduce its taxable income through distributions. A REIT must comply with a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it must pay at least 90 of its taxable income to shareholders. 
 As a result of our predominately non-taxable structure historically, income taxes on taxable income or losses realized by our predecessor, OpCo, were generally the obligation of the individual members or partners. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to our predecessor, OpCo, contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality (other than margin tax in the State of Texas). Following consummation of the Offering, although we are a limited liability company, we have elected to be taxed as a corporation and are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on our allocable share of the income and loss of OpCo.

Total revenues . Total revenues increased by 10.7 million, or 60 , to 28.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased surface use royalties of 6.7 million, easements and other surface-related revenues of 4.3 million, resource royalties of 2.5 million and resource sales of 0.6 million, partially offset by decreased oil and gas royalties of 3.4 million. Please see our discussion below regarding comparative period variances in revenue sources. 
 Surface use royalties . Surface use royalties increased by 6.7 million, or 209 , to 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased produced water handling and associated skim oil royalties of 6.3 million and industrial waste handling royalties of 0.2 million on our surface for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Easements and other surface-related revenues . Easements and other surface-related revenues increased by 4.3 million, or 187 , to 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to oil and gas transportation and gathering pipelines and produced water handling infrastructure of 3.4 million and other surface and subsurface easements of 0.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Resource sales . Resource sales increased by 0.6 million, or 14 , to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in brackish water sales volume by 0.7 million barrels, or 9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the unit price per barrel of brackish water sold remained flat. The brackish water sales volume increase is primarily due to the timing of customer demand in the areas surrounding our surface acreage, primarily upstream drilling and completion operations. 
 Oil and gas royalties . Oil and gas royalties decreased by 3.4 million, or 54 , to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which consists of decreased royalty income of 3.3 million and lower mineral lease income of 0.1 million. The decrease in mineral lease income is attributable to an immaterial adjustment to a mineral lease during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to no activity during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The table below provides operational and financial data by oil and gas royalty stream for the periods indicated.

Resource royalties . Resource royalties increased by 2.5 million, or 156 , to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to brackish water royalties in connection with the East Stateline Ranch acquisition of 2.5 million and increased sand mine volumes of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Resource sales-related expense . Resource sales related expense decreased by 0.6 million, or 60 , to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower utility expenses due to installation and connection to overhead electric infrastructure and lower water well repairs and maintenance for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative expense (income) . General and administrative expense (income), excluding share-based compensation expense, increased by 9.1 million, or 650 , to 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to Offering-related employee bonuses of 5.0 million, a contract termination payment of 2.6 million and higher professional services fees and other non-capitalizable expenses associated with transitioning to a publicly traded company of 1.3 million. 
 General and administrative expense (income), inclusive of share-based compensation, increased by 27.7 million, or 495 , to 22.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to the change in share-based compensation expense of 18.5 million and increased cash expenses noted above. The share-based compensation is comprised of an increase related to the Incentive Units of 16.7 million and 1.8 million related to the issuance of RSUs issued during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Incentive Units expense increase is primarily due to new issuances and post-modification equity award accounting amortization resulting in expense of 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the remeasurement of the NDB Incentive Units. See Note 8 Share-Based Compensation within the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion . Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion decreased by 0.6 million, or 23 , to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower depletion expense of 0.6 million due to a natural decline in oil and gas production with minimal oil and gas royalty development activities during 2024. 
 Interest expense, net . Interest expense, net, increased by 4.2 million, or 145 , to 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to additional borrowings under our Credit Facilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding the Company s debt instruments and interest expense.

Total revenues . Total revenues increased by 18.1 million, or 33 , to 73.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 55.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was comprised of an increase in surface use royalties of 12.4 million, easements and other surface-related revenues of 9.7 million and resource royalties of 4.6 million, partially offset by decreased resource sales of 5.3 million and oil and gas royalties of 3.3 million. Please see our discussion below regarding comparative period variances in revenue sources. 
 
 Surface use royalties . Surface use royalties increased by 12.4 million, or 144 , to 21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased produced water handling and associated skim oil royalties of 11.8 million and industrial waste handling royalties of 0.5 million on our surface for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Easements and other surface-related revenues . Easements and other surface-related revenues increased by 9.7 million, or 102 , to 19.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to oil and natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines and produced water handling infrastructure of 7.6 million and 2.1 million in other surface easements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Resource sales . Resource sales decreased by 5.3 million, or 30 , to 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Brackish water sales volume decreased by 7.7 million barrels, or 22 , to 27.8 million barrels for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 35.5 million barrels for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the per unit sales price decreased by approximately 15 . The brackish water sales volume decrease is primarily due to the timing of customer demand in the areas surrounding our surface acreage, primarily upstream drilling and completion operations. Lower unit sales rates are driven by the customer contract mix for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Oil and gas royalties . Oil and gas royalties decreased by 3.3 million, or 22 , to 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consists of decreased royalty income of 3.0 million offset by lower mineral lease income of 0.3 million. Mineral lease income decreased 0.3 million, primarily attributable to fewer net mineral acres leased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The table below provides operational and financial data by oil and gas royalty stream for the periods indicated.

Resource royalties . Resource royalties increased by 4.6 million, or 96 , to 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to brackish water royalties in connection with the East Stateline Ranch acquisition of 3.6 million and an increase attributable to sand mine royalty rates of 0.5 million and sand mine volumes of 0.4 million. 
 Resource sales-related expense . Resource sales-related expense decreased by 1.4 million, or 45 , to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower utility expenses and purchase of third-party water and transfer costs associated with sales of brackish water driven by the lower volumes sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other operating and maintenance expense . Other operating and maintenance expense decreased by 0.2 million, or 10 , to 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower production taxes on oil and gas royalties due to decreased oil and gas royalty income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative expense (income) . General and administrative expense (income), excluding share-based compensation expense, increased by 10.2 million, or 268 , to 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to Offering-related employee bonuses of 5.0 million, a contract termination payment of 2.6 million, higher professional services fees and other non-capitalizable expenses associated with transitioning to a publicly traded company of 1.3 million, professional services fees primarily associated with amending the Company s Credit Facilities in conjunction with acquisition-related activities and entity restructuring of 0.7 million and 0.3 million in increased corporate shared services allocation from WaterBridge. 
 General and administrative expense (income), inclusive of share-based compensation, increased by 118.7 million, or 576 , to expense of 98.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to the change in share-based compensation expense of 108.5 million and increased cash expenses noted above. The share-based compensation is comprised of an increase related to the Incentive Units of 106.8 million and 1.8 million related to the issuance of RSUs. The Incentive Units expense increase is primarily due to the periodic remeasurements of NDB Incentive Units prior to the Division of 72.6 million when the awards were accounted for as liability awards at NDB LLC and new issuances and post-modification equity award accounting amortization of 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 24.4 million due to remeasurement of the NDB Incentive Units for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 8 Share-Based Compensation within the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion . Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion decreased by 0.1 million, or 2 , to 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower depletion expense of 0.2 million due to a natural decline in oil and gas production with minimal oil and gas royalty development activities during 2024 partially offset by higher depreciation expense of 0.1 million related to capital expenditures associated with brackish water supply infrastructure. 
 Interest expense, net . Interest expense, net, increased by 12.0 million, or 286 , to 16.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to additional principal borrowings under our Credit Facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to borrowings under our then-existing debt instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding the Company s debt instruments and interest expense. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are supplemental non-GAAP measures that we use to evaluate current, past and expected future performance. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and cash flows, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or gross margin or any other measures presented under GAAP.

(1) Share-based compensation - Incentive Units for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consists of 9.8 million related to the Incentive Units, and 72.6 million related to the NDB Incentive Units, and 9.8 million related to the Incentive Units, respectively. Share-based compensation - Incentive Units for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, consists only of the NDB Incentive Units. NDB Incentive Units were liability awards resulting in periodic fair value remeasurement prior to the Division. Subsequent to the Offering, any actual cash expense associated with such Incentive Units is borne solely by LandBridge Holdings and not the Company. Distributions attributable to Incentive Units are based on returns received by investors of LandBridge Holdings once certain return thresholds have been met and are neither an obligation of the Company nor taken into consideration for distributions to investors in the Company. 

(2) Transaction-related expenses consist of non-capitalizable transaction costs associated with both completed or attempted acquisitions, debt amendments, entity structuring and non-capitalizable Offering-related charges. 

(3) Non-recurring expenses consist primarily of 5.0 million in Offering-related employee bonuses and 2.6 million related to a contract termination payment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been capital contributions from NDB LLC, cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments. Following the completion of the Offering, our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and, if required, proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Facilities. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements will be for our operating expenses, servicing of our debt, the payment of dividends to our shareholders, general company needs and investing in our business, including the potential acquisition of additional surface acreage, such as the Acquisitions. We believe that we are able to fully fund our ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other capital needs for the foreseeable short-term and long-term future through cash on hand and cash flows from our operating activities. Although we believe that we will be able to fully fund our ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other capital needs for the foreseeable future through cash on hand and cash flows from our operating activities, we may choose to use borrowings under our credit facility to finance our operating and investing activities. See Debt Instruments Credit Facility . 
 We strive to maintain financial flexibility and proactively monitor potential capital sources, including equity and debt financing, to meet our target liquidity and capital requirements. If market conditions were to change and our revenues were to decline significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced and we could be required to seek alternative financing sources. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of 11.7 million and we had cash and cash equivalents of 14.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had working capital of 25.2 million and cash and cash equivalents of 37.8 million.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities . Net cash provided by operating activities increased 0.1 million or less than 1 to 40.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 40.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to cash flow related to working capital accounts, primarily accounts receivable, of 2.1 million offset by lower net income, net of non-cash items, of 2.0 million. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities increased 429.4 million or 16,515 to 432.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to acquisition-related expenditures of 431.3 million consisting of the purchase of Lea County Ranches, Speed Ranch and East Stateline Ranch offset by lower capital expenditures, primarily supporting brackish water supply sales, of 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities increased 413.9 million or 900 to 367.9 million of cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used of 46.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities consisted of 271.3 million of proceeds from the Offering, net of offering costs and discount, 147.5 million of debt borrowings, net of repayments and debt issuance costs, primarily used to fund the May 2024 Acquisitions, offset by net distributions to member prior to the Corporate Reorganization of 50.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was attributable to member distributions of 105.2 million and by debt proceeds, net of repayments and issuance costs, of 59.2 million. 
 Capital Requirements 
 We focus our business model on entering into agreements under which our customers bear substantially all of the operating and capital expenditures related to their operations on our land, while minimizing our capital requirements for both current and future commercial opportunities, resulting in the ability to create significant free cash flows. Our contracts generally include inflation escalators, which, when combined with our relatively low operating and capital expenditures, may assist in mitigating our exposure to broader inflationary pressures. As a landowner, we incur the initial cost to acquire our acreage, but thereafter we incur modest development capital expenditures and operating expenses as it relates to operations on our land or our mineral and royalty interests, as such expenses are borne primarily by our customers. As a result, we expect that additional significant capital expenditures would be related to our acquisition of additional surface acreage, such as the Acquisitions, should we elect to do so. 
 The amount and allocation of future acquisition-related capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors, including the size of the acquisition opportunity, our cash flows from operating activities and our investing and financing activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred approximately 0.8 million for acquisition-related capital expenditures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 431.3 million in acquisition-related capital expenditures, inclusive of 2.7 million of transaction-related expenses, in connection with the consummation of the Acquisitions. 
 We periodically assess changes in current and projected cash flows, acquisition and divestiture activities and other factors to determine the effects on our liquidity. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current strategy. However, our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors that may directly or indirectly affect us, many of which are beyond our control, including commodity prices and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. If we require additional capital for acquisitions or other reasons, we may seek such capital through traditional borrowings under our debt instruments, offerings of debt and equity securities or other means. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us. 
 As our Board declares cash dividends to our Class A shareholders, we expect the dividend to be paid from Free Cash Flow. We do not currently expect to borrow funds or to adjust planned capital expenditures to finance dividends on our Class A shares. The timing, amount and financing of dividends, if any, will be subject to the discretion of our Board from time to time. 
 Debt Instruments 
 Ag Loan 
 On October 14, 2021, our subsidiary, Delaware Basin Ranches, Inc., entered into a 65.0 million credit agreement (the Ag Loan that was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2028. Borrowings under the Ag Loan were repaid in full with borrowings under our new credit facility in July 2023. 
 43 

Credit Facility 
 On July 3, 2023, DBR Land LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of OpCo DBR Land and certain of our other subsidiaries entered into a credit facility providing (i) a 100.0 million term loan and (ii) a 50.0 million revolving credit facility, each of which matures on July 3, 2027. In connection with entering into our credit facility, we borrowed 100.0 million under the term loan facility and 25.0 million under the revolving credit facility. Net proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay the 49.4 million outstanding under our prior credit facility and to make a distribution of 72.9 million to NDB LLC. In connection with the Acquisitions, we amended the credit facility to, among other things, increase (i) the four-year term loan facility to 350.0 million and (ii) the four-year revolving credit facility to 75.0 million. Following our entry into the amendment, we borrowed 265.0 million under our term loan facility to fund a portion of the purchase price of each of the Acquisitions. On November 4, 2024, we entered into the Second Credit Agreement Amendment to increase the maximum available amount under our Revolving Credit Facility to 100.0 million, increase the principal amount of the Term Loan to 300.0 million, with an additional 75.0 million uncommitted delayed draw term loan, and eliminate the Company s obligation to make Term Loan amortization payments. Our credit facility is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets and guaranteed by DBR Land and our restricted subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries). 
 Our credit facility includes certain affirmative and restrictive covenants common in such agreements that apply to DBR Land and its subsidiaries. See Note 6 Debt within the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements and included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further information with respect to such affirmative and restrictive covenants. 
 The estimated fair value of our credit facility approximates the principal amount outstanding because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates and the debt may be repaid, in full or in part, at any time without penalty. 
 We may elect for outstanding borrowings under our credit facility to accrue interest at a rate based on either (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate Term SOFR plus 0.10 , or (ii) the base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. Borrowings under our credit facility accrue interest based on a five-tiered pricing grid tied to our current leverage ratio. The applicable margin ranges from (i) prior to the consummation of the Offering, 3.00 to 4.00 in the case of Term SOFR loans and letter of credit fees, and 2.00 to 3.00 in the case of base rate loans, and commitments fees of 0.50 , and (ii) following consummation of the Offering, 2.75 to 3.75 in the case of Term SOFR loans and letter of credit fees, and 1.75 to 2.75 in the case of base rate loans, and commitment fees range from 0.375 to 0.50 . Our credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries, which are party to our credit facility as guarantors, and all outstanding equity interests issued by DBR Land, which are held by OpCo. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 281.3 million of outstanding borrowings consisting of 15.0 million of revolving credit borrowings and 266.3 million of term loan borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on the total amount of borrowings outstanding under new credit facility for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.54 in the case of revolving credit borrowings, and 8.56 in the case of term loan borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on the total amount of borrowings outstanding under new credit facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.45 in the case of revolving credit borrowings and 8.49 in the case of term loan borrowings. We are currently in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants under our new credit facility. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider our critical accounting estimates those that require subjectivity and that could inherently influence our financial result based on changes in those estimates. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Basis of Presentation and Consolidation within the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 Incentive Units 
 The Company accounts for share-based compensation expense for incentive units granted in exchange for employee services. 
 Prior to the Division, our management and employees participated in an equity-based incentive unit plan, managed by NDB LLC, the direct parent of the Company. 
 The NDB Incentive Units represented a substantive class of equity of NDB LLC and were accounted for under FASB ASC 718. Features of the NDB Incentive Units included the ability for NDB LLC to repurchase NDB Incentive Units during a 180-day option period, whereby the fair value price was determined as of the termination date, not the repurchase date, which temporarily takes away 
 44 

the rights and risks and rewards of ownership from the NDB Incentive Unit holder during the option period. Under ASC 718, a feature for which the employee could bear the risks, but not gain the rewards, normally associated with equity ownership requires liability classification. NDB LLC classified the NDB Incentive Units as liability awards. The liability related to the NDB Incentive Units was recognized at NDB LLC as the entity responsible for satisfying the obligation. Share-based compensation income or expense pushed down to the Company was recognized as a deemed non-cash contribution to or distribution from member s equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The share-based compensation income or expense was recognized consistent with NDB LLC s classification of a liability award resulting in the initial measurement, and subsequent remeasurements, recognized ratably over the vesting period. 
 At each reporting period, the NDB Incentive Units were remeasured at their fair value, consistent with liability award accounting, using a Monte Carlo Simulation. The Monte Carlo Simulation requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve numerous variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected unit price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected distribution yield and the expected life of the NDB Incentive Unit. The vested portion of the NDB Incentive Unit liability was allocated pro rata to the Company, and other NDB LLC operating subsidiaries, as general and administrative expense or income on the consolidated statements of operations. The allocation was based on the Company s share of the aggregate equity value derived in NDB LLC s business enterprise valuation. 
 The Company updated its assumptions each reporting period based on new developments and adjusted such amounts to fair value based on revised assumptions, if applicable, over the vesting period. The fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and thus represented Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. 
 The risk-free rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of each award and updated at each balance sheet date for the time period approximating the expected term of such award. The expected distribution yield was based on no previously paid distributions and no intention of paying distributions on the NDB Incentive Units for the foreseeable future. 
 Due to the Company not having sufficient historical volatility, the Company used the historical volatilities of publicly traded companies that were similar to the Company in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. 
 On July 1, 2024, as a result of the Division, holders of NDB Incentive Units received an identical number of Incentive Units consisting of time-based awards of profits interests in LandBridge Holdings. Following the Division, the Incentive Units held at LandBridge Holdings are the only Incentive Units attributable and allocated to the Company. 
 Further, as part of the Division, the repurchase feature triggering liability award accounting of the NDB Incentive Units under the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of NDB LLC (the NDB LLC Agreement was amended in connection with the entry into the LandBridge Holdings Limited Liability Company Agreement, dated July 1, 2024 (the Holdings LLC Agreement ). Features of the Incentive Units include the ability for LandBridge Holdings to repurchase Incentive Units during a 180-day option period, whereby the fair value price is determined as of the repurchase date, which subjects the Incentive Unit holder to the normal rights, risks and rewards of ownership. The repurchase feature is a non-contingent call option as the call becomes effective upon (i) the employee s termination of employment either by the Company (with or without cause) or (ii) voluntary resignation by employee and it is assured that all employees will eventually terminate. Under ASC 718, a feature for which the employee could bear the risks and rewards normally associated with equity ownership and a non-contingent call option not probable to be exercised within six months requires equity classification. As such, beginning on July 1, 2024, the Incentive Units are no longer required to be remeasured at fair value, as the modification results in equity award classification and accounting. See Note 8 Share-Based Compensation for additional information related to the modification. 
 Distributions attributable to Incentive Units are based on returns received by investors of LandBridge Holdings once certain return thresholds have been met. Incentive Units are solely a payment obligation of LandBridge Holdings, and neither the Company nor OpCo has any cash or other obligation to make payments in connection with the Incentive Units. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Oil and gas royalties 
 45 

Oil and gas royalties are received in connection with oil and natural gas mineral interests owned by the Company. Oil and gas royalties are recognized as revenue as oil and gas are produced or severed from the mineral lease. The oil and gas royalties we receive includes variable consideration that is dependent upon market prices for oil and gas, and producer specific location and contractual price differences. As a result, our oil and gas royalty revenues are typically constrained at the inception of the contract but will be resolved once volumes are produced and settled. Oil and gas royalty payments are typically received one to three months following the month of production. We accrue oil and gas royalties produced but not yet paid based on the historical or estimated royalty interest production and current market prices, net of estimated location and contract pricing differentials. The difference between estimated and actual amounts received for oil and gas royalties are recorded in the period the payment is received. 
 We monitor drilling and completion activity on our mineral acreage position from publicly available sources to identify when new royalty interest production may be coming online. We estimate our royalty interest ownership in new production wells based on our assessment of available information. Ultimate determination of division order interest from the operator could results in amounts that differ from our initial estimates. The differences related to estimated interest estimated and actual division order interest are recorded in the period in which final division orders are issued or in the period in which the initial payment is received. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 1.3 million and 3.6 million of oil and gas royalties in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, respectively. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), on January 1, 2023, which changed how we account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The adoption of this did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). This guidance requires a public entity, including entities with a single reportable segment, to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. We plan to adopt this guidance and conform with the applicable disclosures retrospectively when it becomes mandatorily effective for our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This guidance further enhances income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. We plan to adopt this guidance and conform with the disclosure requirements when it becomes mandatorily effective for our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2025. 
 Internal Controls and Procedures 
 We are not currently required to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. We are required to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will not be required to make our first assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 until our second annual report on Form 10-K after we become a public company. 
 Further, our independent registered public accounting firm is not yet required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and will not be required to do so for as long as we are an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company under applicable federal securities laws. 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We currently have no material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to 
 46 

be an emerging growth company if we have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue, we have more than 700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. 
 47 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks, which include the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and counterparty and customer credit risks and interest rate risk as described below. The primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and counterparty and customer credit and interest rate risk. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. 
 Commodity Price Risks 
 One of our major market risk exposures relates to the prices that our customers receive for the oil and natural gas produced from, or serviced on, our land. The market for the use of our land and its resources is indirectly exposed to fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas, to the extent such fluctuations impact drilling, completion and production activity levels and thus impact the activity levels of our customers in the exploration and production and oilfield services industries. Realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas in the United States. We are also directly exposed to these risks with respect to revenues we receive from the oil and natural gas interests. Pricing for oil and natural gas has been historically volatile and unpredictable, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. 
 During the past five years, the Henry Hub spot market price for natural gas has ranged from a low of 1.25 per MMBtu in March 2024 to a high of 23.86 per MMBtu in February 2021. The posted price for WTI has ranged from a low of negative 36.98 per barrel in April 2020 to a high of 123.64 per barrel in March 2022. As of September 30, 2024, the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was 2.65 per MMBtu and the posted price for oil was 68.75 per barrel. Lower prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that our customers can produce or service economically. We expect this market will continue to be volatile in the future. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
 We do not currently intend to hedge our indirect exposure to commodity price risk. We may in the future enter into derivative instruments, such as collars, swaps and basis swaps, to partially mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility. These hedging instruments would allow us to reduce, but not eliminate, the potential effects of the variability in cash flow from operations due to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. 
 Market Risks 
 Demand for the use of land and resources are largely dependent upon the level of activity in the energy industry in the Permian Basin. These activity levels are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including: the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the expected rates of declining current production; the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves; available pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity; weather conditions; domestic and worldwide economic conditions; political instability domestically, as a result of the fall 2024 U.S. presidential election and congressional elections or otherwise, and in oil-producing countries; environmental regulations; technical advances affecting energy consumption; the transition to a low-carbon economy; the price and availability of alternative fuels; technological advancements in the production of alternative energy; the ability of energy companies to raise equity capital and debt financing; and industry consolidation and merger and divestiture activity among energy companies. 
 The level of U.S. energy production, including oil and natural gas development activity, is volatile. Any prolonged and substantial reduction in oil and natural gas prices would likely affect development and production activity levels and therefore affect demand for oil and natural gas and the use of our land and resources. A material decline in energy, including oil and natural gas, prices or Permian Basin activity levels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
 Interest Rate Risks 
 Our ability to borrow and the rates offered by lenders can be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit markets and/or deterioration of our credit profile rating. We may elect for outstanding borrowings under our credit facility to accrue interest at a rate based on either the Term SOFR, or the base rate, plus an applicable margin, which exposes us to interest rate risk to the extent we have borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 281.3 million of outstanding borrowings consisting of 15.0 million of revolving credit borrowings and 266.3 million of term loan borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.45 in the case of revolving credit borrowings, and 8.49 in 
 48 

the case of term loan borrowings. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding, the impact on interest expense of a 1.0 increase or decrease in the weighted average interest rate would be 2.8 million per year. We do not currently have or intend to enter into any derivative hedge contracts to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to our outstanding indebtedness. See Debt Instruments Credit Facility . 
 Item 4. Co ntrols and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are periodically party to proceedings and claims incidental to our business. While many of these other matters may not be predicted with certainty, we believe that the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to such other proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our liquidity, capital resources, future results of operations or cash flows. We will continue to evaluate proceedings and claims involving us on a regular basis and will establish and adjust any estimated reserves as appropriate to reflect our assessment of the then current status of the matters. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in the Prospectus. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in the Prospectus. 
 Item 2. Unregi stered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Private Placement 
 On June 27, 2024, we entered into a Common Share Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor (the Accredited Investor ), pursuant to which the Accredited Investor purchased 750,000 Class A shares from us at 17.00 per share in a private placement that closed concurrently with the Offering (the Private Placement ), resulting in net proceeds of approximately 12.5 million after deducting fees to the placement agent and other expenses payable by the Company in connection with the Private Placement. We contributed the net proceeds from the Private Placement to OpCo in exchange for additional OpCo Units and OpCo used such net proceeds, together with net proceeds from the Offering and the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, to repay outstanding indebtedness and make a distribution to existing unitholders. The Private Placement closed concurrently with the Offering on July 1, 2024. Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, acted as the placement agent for the Private Placement. The securities issued in connection with the Private Placement were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Accredited Investor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501 of Regulation D. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Neither we nor any affiliated purchaser repurchased any of our equity securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Unless L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article 4 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of Borrower (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 51 42297167v.11 

Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
 (iii)	If Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit; provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each 12-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such 12-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by L/C Issuer, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however , that L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension (and the terms of the Auto-Extension Letter of Credit may permit L/C Issuer to refuse to extend such Letter of Credit) if (A) L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.2(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Credit Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
 (iv)	Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, L/C Issuer will also deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
 (c)	 Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations . 
 (i)	Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, L/C Issuer shall notify Borrower and Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date ), Borrower shall reimburse L/C Issuer through Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If Borrower fails to so reimburse L/C Issuer by such time, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, subject to the amount of the Revolving Credit Availability and the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (other than the delivery of a Revolving Credit Borrowing Request). Any notice given by L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 52 42297167v.11 

confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (ii)	Each Revolving Credit Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i) make funds available (and Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of L/C Issuer at Administrative Agent s Principal Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.2(c)(iii) , each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan (or, if the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 are not satisfied, an L/C Borrowing as further described in clause (iii) below) to Borrower in such amount. Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to L/C Issuer. 
 (iii)	With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing because the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Interest Rate. In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender s payment to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Credit Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.2 . 
 (iv)	Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) to reimburse L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of L/C Issuer. 
 (v)	Each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Credit Lender may have against L/C Issuer, Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however , that each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans (but not its obligation to fund its Applicable Percentage of L/C Advances) pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (other than delivery by Borrower of a Revolving Credit Borrowing Request). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of Borrower to reimburse L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (vi)	If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2(c) by the time specified in Section 2.2(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 53 42297167v.11 

the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Credit Lender s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d)	 Repayment of Participations . 
 (i)	At any time after L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Revolving Credit Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.2(c) , if Administrative Agent receives for the account of L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by Administrative Agent), Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by Administrative Agent. 
 (ii)	If any payment received by Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.24 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Credit Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 (e)	 Obligations Absolute . The obligation of Borrower to reimburse L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
 (i)	any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
 (ii)	the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
 (iii)	any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 54 42297167v.11 

any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
 (iv)	waiver by L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for L/C Issuer s protection and not the protection of Borrower or any waiver by L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice Borrower; 
 (v)	honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft; 
 (vi)	any payment made by L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC or the ISP, as applicable; 
 (vii)	any payment by L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or 
 (viii)	any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary. 
 Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, Borrower will immediately notify L/C Issuer. Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
 (f)	 Role of L/C Issuer . Each Revolving Credit Lender and Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Revolving Credit Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Required Revolving Credit Lenders; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Person as found in a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Borrower hereby assumes all risks of, and none of L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, or any Lender or any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability for, the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided , however , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of L/C Issuer, Administrative 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 55 42297167v.11 

Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (viii) of Section 2.2(e); provided , however , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower may have a claim against L/C Issuer, and L/C Issuer may be liable to Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by Borrower which Borrower proves were directly caused by L/C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or L/C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit as found in a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
 (g)	 Applicability of ISP; Limitation of Liability . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by L/C Issuer and Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to Borrower for, and L/C Issuer s rights and remedies against Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of L/C Issuer required or permitted under any Law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit or other Issuer Document chooses such Law or practice. 
 (h)	 Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer . Borrower shall pay directly to L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each standby Letter of Credit at the rate per annum separately agreed between Borrower and L/C Issuer, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and payable in full on the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit and on the date of any increase or extension thereof. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.4 .

 (j)	 Letters of Credit Issued for Restricted Subsidiaries .

 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 56 42297167v.11 

reimburse L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of Borrower and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Restricted Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of Borrower, and that Borrower s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Restricted Subsidiaries. 
 Section 3.3	 Fees . 
 (a)	 Fees . Borrower agrees to pay to Administrative Agent and Arranger, for the account of Administrative Agent, Arranger and each Lender, as applicable, fees, in the amounts and on the dates set forth in the Fee Letters. 
 (b)	 Letter of Credit Fees .

Letter of Credit Fees for each standby Letter of Credit shall be (i) due and payable in arrears on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance or renewal of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Margin for Term SOFR Loans during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each standby Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin for Term SOFR Loans separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Margin for Term SOFR Loans was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Interest Rate. 
 (c)	 Commitment Fees . Borrower agrees to pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance, subject to Section 11.22 , with its Applicable Percentage a commitment fee Commitment Fees on the daily average unused amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Revolving Credit Lender for the period from and including the date of this Agreement to and including the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility (including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article 4 is not met), at a rate equal to the applicable amount set forth for Commitment Fees in the definition of Applicable Margin. For the purpose of calculating the Commitment Fees hereunder, the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed utilized by the amount of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations owing to such Revolving Credit Lender whether directly or by participation.

 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 57 42297167v.11 

funds, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, at the time and in the manner provided herein. Payments by check or draft shall not constitute payment in immediately available funds until the required amount is actually received by Administrative Agent in full. Payments in immediately available funds received by Administrative Agent in the place designated for payment on a Business Day prior to 11:00 a.m. at such place of payment shall be credited prior to the close of business on the Business Day received, while payments received by Administrative Agent on a day other than a Business Day or after 11:00 a.m. on a Business Day shall not be credited until the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment of principal or interest required under the Loan Documents shall become due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. Any such extension of time for payment shall be included in computing interest which has accrued and shall be payable in connection with such payment. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized upon notice to Borrower to charge the account of Borrower maintained with Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder. 
 (b)	 Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender s share of a Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Agreement and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Borrowing. If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan. Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent. 
 (c)	 Payments by Borrower; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer or the applicable Lenders hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to L/C Issuer or the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of L/C Issuer and the applicable Lenders, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to L/C Issuer or such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

The Credit Extensions made by L/C Issuer shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by L/C Issuer and by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer, and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made to Borrower and, with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of a Restricted Subsidiary, such Restricted Subsidiary and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by L/C Issuer or any Lender and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
 (b)	In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) above, each Revolving Credit Lender and Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Revolving Credit Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolving Credit Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
 Section 3.6	 Cash Collateral . 
 (a)	 Certain Credit Support Events . If (i) L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.8(c) or Section 9.2 , or (iv) there shall exist a Revolving Credit Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, Borrower shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one (1) Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, after giving effect to Section 11.22(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
 (b)	 Grant of Security Interest .

If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more blocked, non-interest bearing Deposit Accounts at Texas Capital Bank.

 (d)	 Release . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto, including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 11.8(b)(vii) or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided , however , (x) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the Loan Documents and the other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents, and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 
 Section 3.7	 Interest; Payment Terms . 
 (a)	 Revolving Credit Loans Payment of Principal and Interest; Revolving Nature . The unpaid principal amount of each Borrowing of the Revolving Credit Loans shall, subject to the following sentence and Section 2.7(f) , bear interest at the applicable Interest Rate. If at any time such rate of interest would exceed the Maximum Rate but for the provisions hereof limiting interest to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reduction shall not reduce the rate of interest on the Revolving Credit Loans below the Maximum Rate until the aggregate amount of interest accrued on the Revolving Credit Loans equals the aggregate amount of interest which would have accrued on the Revolving Credit Loans if the interest rate had not been limited by the Maximum Rate. All accrued but unpaid interest on the principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be payable on each Payment Date and on the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility, provided that interest accruing at the Default Interest Rate pursuant to Section 2.7(f) shall be payable on demand. The then Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date for the Revolving Credit Facility. The unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans at any time shall be the total amount advanced hereunder by Revolving Credit Lenders less the amount of principal payments made thereon by or for Borrower, which balance may be endorsed on the Revolving Credit Notes from time to time by Revolving Credit Lenders or otherwise noted in Revolving Credit Lenders and/or Administrative Agent s records, which notations shall be, absent manifest error, conclusive evidence of the amounts owing hereunder from time to time. 
 (b)	 Term Loan Payment of Principal and Interest . 
 (i)	The unpaid principal amount of the Term Loans shall, subject to the following sentence and Section 2.7(f) , bear interest at the applicable Interest Rate. If at any time such rate of interest shall exceed the Maximum Rate but for the provisions thereof limiting interest to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reduction shall not reduce the

Acceptance by Administrative Agent of any payment in an amount less than the full amount then 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 61 42297167v.11 

due shall be deemed an acceptance on account only, and the failure to pay the entire amount then due shall be and continue to be a Default or Event of Default (as applicable).

 Further notwithstanding, Bank Product Obligations shall be excluded from the application described above if Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with supporting documentation as Administrative Agent may request from the applicable Bank Product Provider, provided that no such notice shall be required for any Bank Product Agreement for which Administrative Agent or any Affiliate of Administrative Agent is the applicable Bank Product Provider. Each Bank Product Provider that is not a party to this Agreement that has given notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article 10 hereof for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party hereto. 
 Section 10.4	 Right to Cure . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 9.1 or 9.2 , in the event that Borrower fails to comply with the requirements of the Financial Covenants as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of Borrower, at any time after the beginning of such fiscal quarter until the expiration of the 10th Business Day following the date on which the financial statements with respect to such fiscal quarter are required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(b) Cure Period ), Borrower or any other Person that is a direct or indirect parent of Borrower shall have the right to issue common Equity Interests for cash or otherwise receive cash contributions to the capital of Borrower as cash common Equity Interests (collectively, the Cure Right ), and upon the receipt by Borrower of the Net Cash Proceeds of 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 113 42297167v.11 

such issuance that are not otherwise applied (the Cure Amount ), pursuant to the exercise by Borrower of such Cure Right such Financial Covenants shall be recalculated giving effect to the following pro forma adjustment: 
 (a)	EBITDA (after giving effect to any annualization thereof) shall be increased with respect to such applicable fiscal quarter and any Test Period that contains such fiscal quarter, solely for the purpose of measuring the Financial Covenants and not for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure Amount; 
 (b)	if, after giving effect to the foregoing pro forma adjustment, Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the Financial Covenants, Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Financial Covenants as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of the Financial Covenants that had occurred shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement; 
 (c)	notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in each four (4) consecutive fiscal quarter period of Borrower there shall be at least two (2) fiscal quarters in which the Cure Right is not exercised, (ii) the Cure Right may not be exercised in consecutive fiscal quarters, (iii) during the term of this Agreement, the Cure Right shall not be exercised more than four (4) times, (iv) the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount required for purposes of complying with the Financial Covenants, and any amounts in excess thereof shall not be deemed to be a Cure Amount (except that not more than one (1) time during the term of this Agreement, the Cure Amount may be made in an amount up to 120 of the amount required for purposes of complying with the Financial Covenants), (v) there shall be no pro forma reduction in Debt with the proceeds of any Cure Amount and (vi) if increasing EBITDA, the Cure Amount shall be included in the calculation only after calculating EBITDA on an annualized basis without giving effect to such increase (i.e., the Cure Amount shall not be annualized). Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Cure Amount received pursuant to any exercise of the Cure Right shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the satisfaction of any Default or Event of Default condition, any financial ratio-based conditions or tests, pricing or any available basket under Article 7 of this Agreement; and 
 (d)	to the extent that the proceeds of the Cure Amount are used to repay Debt, such Debt shall not be deemed to have been repaid for purposes of calculating any Financial Covenant for the Test Period ending on (and including) the last day of the fiscal reporting period for which Borrower is requesting to cure a Financial Covenant Event of Default. 
 Unless (A) the Borrower or any other Loan Party has stated in writing that it does not intend to exercise the Cure Right or (B) the Event of Default is precluded from being cured pursuant to this Section 9.4 because of clause (c) above, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall exercise any remedy under the Loan Documents (including application of the Default Interest Rate) on the basis of an Event of Default caused solely by the failure of the Loan Parties to comply with Article 8 until the end of the Cure Period. During any Cure Period (unless and until the Event of Default is cured pursuant to this Section 9.4 ), the Borrower shall not request, and the Lenders shall not be required to make and the L/C Issuer shall not be required to issue, renew or extend, as applicable, (i) any Loans or any Letters of Credit or (ii) any conversions from Base Rate Loans into Term SOFR Loans or continuations of Term SOFR Loans (which shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period). 
 Section 10.5	 Performance by Administrative Agent . If any Loan Party shall fail to perform any covenant or agreement contained in any of the Loan Documents, then Administrative Agent may (but 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 114 42297167v.11 

shall have no obligation to) perform or attempt to perform such covenant or agreement on behalf of such Loan Party. In such event, Borrower shall, at the request of Administrative Agent, promptly pay to Administrative Agent any amount expended by Administrative Agent in connection with such performance or attempted performance, together with interest thereon at the Default Interest Rate from and including the date of such expenditure to but excluding the date such expenditure is paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly agreed that Administrative Agent shall not have any liability or responsibility for the performance of any covenant, agreement, or other obligation of Borrower or any other Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 ARTICLE 11. AGENCY

In this connection, Administrative Agent, as collateral agent and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.5 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 10 and Article 11 (including Section 11.1(b) , as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the collateral agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 
 (c)	Each Secured Party, whether or not a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and of the guarantees of the Obligations provided under the Loan Documents, to have agreed to the provisions of this Article 10 . 
 Section 11.2	 Rights as a Lender . The Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 115 42297167v.11 

expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders or to provide notice to or obtain the consent of the Lenders with respect thereto.

 (ii)	shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) or is required to exercise as directed in writing by any other party to any intercreditor agreement, as applicable; provided that Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or upon the advice of its counsel, may expose Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of Property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; 
 (iii)	shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; 
 (iv)	shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action; and

 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 116 42297167v.11

SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIABILITY ARISES FROM THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to Administrative Agent in writing by Borrower or any other Loan Party, a Lender, or L/C Issuer. 
 (c)	Neither Administrative Agent nor any Related Party thereof shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to Administrative Agent. 
 Section 11.4	 Reliance by Administrative Agent . Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person, including any certificate delivered by a Loan Party pursuant to Section 10.9(a) . Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Credit Extension, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or L/C Issuer unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Credit Extension. Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 Section 11.5	 Delegation of Duties .

Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents. 
 Section 11.6	 Resignation of Administrative Agent . 
 (a)	Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to Lenders, L/C Issuer and Borrower.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date ), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of Lenders and L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender.

Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article 10 , Section 11.1 , and Section 11.2 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
 (c)	Any resignation by Texas Capital Bank as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 10.6 shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer unless the notice thereof otherwise provides.

Section 11.7	 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders . Each Lender and L/C Issuer expressly acknowledges that neither Administrative Agent nor L/C Issuer, the Arranger, any other Lender nor any Related Party thereto has made any representation or warranty to such Person and that no act by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer, the Arranger or any other Lender hereafter taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer, the Arranger or any Lender to any other Lender as to any matter, including whether the Administrative Agent or the Arranger have disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties possession.

Any amount to be paid under this Section 11.2 shall be a demand obligation owing by Borrower and the other Loan Parties and if not paid within ten (10) days of demand shall bear interest, to the extent not prohibited by and not in violation of applicable Law, from the date of expenditure until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Interest Rate. The obligations of Borrower and the other Loan Parties under this Section 11.2 shall survive payment of the Notes and other obligations hereunder and the assignment of any right hereunder. This Section 11.2 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. 
 Section 12.3	 Limitation of Liability .

Each Loan Party hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue Administrative Agent, the Arranger, L/C Issuer, or any Lender, or any of their Related Parties, for punitive damages in respect of any claim in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. 
 Section 12.4	 No Duty . All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, and other professional Persons and consultants retained by the Arranger, Administrative Agent, any Lender, or L/C Issuer shall have the right to act exclusively in the interest of the Arranger, Administrative Agent, such Lender, or L/C Issuer and shall have no duty of disclosure, duty of loyalty, duty of care, or other duty or obligation of any type or nature whatsoever to any Loan Party or any Loan Party s equity holders, Affiliates, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, or any other Person. 
 Section 12.5	 Lenders Not Fiduciary . The relationship between Borrower and each other Loan Party on the one hand, and Administrative Agent, Arranger, each Lender, and L/C Issuer, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor, and none of Administrative Agent, Arranger, any Lender, or L/C Issuer has any fiduciary or other special relationship with Borrower or any other Loan Party, and no term or 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 128 42297167v.11 

condition of any of the Loan Documents shall be construed so as to deem the relationship between Borrower and each other Loan Party on the one hand, and Administrative Agent, Arranger, each Lender, and L/C Issuer, on the other hand, to be other than that of debtor and creditor. The Borrower and each other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that (a) (i) no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries and any Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender is intended to be or has been created in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender has advised or is advising any Loan Party or any Subsidiary on other matters, (ii) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders are arm s-length commercial transactions between the Loan Parties and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, on the other hand, (iii) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent that it has deemed appropriate and (iv) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; and (b) (i) the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person; (ii) none of the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Lenders has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders and their respective branches and Affiliates may be engaged, for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and none of the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Lenders has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against any of the Arranger, Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, and the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. 
 Section 12.6	 Equitable Relief . Each Loan Party recognizes that in the event Borrower or any other Loan Party fails to pay, perform, observe, or discharge any or all of the Obligations, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to Administrative Agent, Lenders, or L/C Issuer. Each Loan Party therefore agrees that Administrative Agent, any Lender, or L/C Issuer, if Administrative Agent, such Lender, or L/C Issuer so requests, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages. 
 Section 12.7	 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies . No failure on the part of Administrative Agent, any Lender, or L/C Issuer to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, remedy, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by Law. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.2 for the benefit of all the Secured Parties and each Lender hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates that is a Secured Party, that, except with the written consent of Administrative Agent, it will not take any enforcement action or exercise any right that it might otherwise 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 129 42297167v.11 

have under applicable Law to credit bid at foreclosure sales, UCC sales or other similar dispositions of Collateral; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 11.25 (subject to the terms of Section 11.23 ), or (c) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further , that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.2 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 11.23 , any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.

 (a)	 Successors and Assigns Generally . The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.8(d)(vi) or Section 11.8(b) , (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.8(d) , or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 11.8(e) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).

 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 130 42297167v.11 

occurred and is continuing, Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 
 (ii)	 Proportionate Amounts; Pro Rata Assignments . Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment(s) assigned; except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis. 
 (iii)	 Required Consents .

The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
 (v)	 No Assignment to Certain Persons . No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Sponsor, any Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B) . 
 (vi)	 No Assignment to Natural Persons . No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person). 
 (vii)	 Certain Additional Payments . In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to such assignment shall make such additional payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 131 42297167v.11 

compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by such Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to: (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
 Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.8(c) , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1 , Section 3.2 , Section 11.1 and Section 11.2 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.8(d) . Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section 11.8(b) , if requested by the transferor or transferee Lender, the transferor Lender, Administrative Agent and Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender (if applicable) and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to the assignee.

Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Dallas, Texas a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a Register.

The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
 (d)	 Participations . Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or any other Loan Party, sell participations to a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) Borrower, each other Loan Party, Administrative Agent, and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 132 42297167v.11 

avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 11.1(b) without regard to the existence of any participation. 
 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 11.10 which requires the consent of all Lenders and affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.4(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.4(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 3.6 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.1 or 3.4 , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.6 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.25 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to pay to Administrative Agent any amount set-off for application to the Obligations under the Loan Documents as required pursuant to Section 11.25 ; provided further that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 11.23 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a Participant Register; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103 1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-5(b) of the United States Proposed Treasury Regulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 (e)	 Certain Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
 (f)	 Dissemination of Information . Borrower and each other Loan Party authorizes Administrative Agent and each Lender to disclose to any actual or prospective purchaser, assignee or other recipient of a Lender s Commitment, any and all information in Administrative Agent s or such Lender s possession concerning Borrower, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates.

Section 12.9	 Survival . All representations and warranties made in this Agreement, any other Loan Document or in any document, statement, or certificate furnished in connection with this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and no investigation by Administrative Agent or any Lender or any closing shall affect the representations and warranties or the right of Administrative Agent or any Lender to rely upon them. Without prejudice to the survival of any other obligation of any Loan Party hereunder, the obligations of the Loan Parties under Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall survive repayment of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments.

Section 12.19	 Additional Interest Provision . It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Lender at all times to comply strictly with the applicable Law governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on the indebtedness evidenced by any Note, any other Loan Document, and the Related Indebtedness (or applicable United States federal Law to the extent that it permits any Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under applicable Law). If the applicable Law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount (a) contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received pursuant to any Note, any of the other Loan Documents or any other communication or writing by or between Borrower or any other Loan Party and any Lender related to the transaction or transactions that are the subject matter of the Loan Documents, (b) contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by reason of Administrative Agent s or any Lender s exercise of the option to accelerate the maturity of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness, or (c) Borrower or any other Loan Party will have paid or Administrative Agent or any Lender will have received by reason of any voluntary prepayment by Borrower or any other Loan Party of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness, then it is Borrower s, each other Loan Party s, Administrative Agent s and Lenders express intent that all amounts charged in excess of the Maximum Rate shall be automatically canceled, ab initio, and all amounts in excess of the Maximum Rate theretofore collected by Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be credited on the principal balance of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness (or, if any Note and all Related Indebtedness have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrower or such other Loan Party, as applicable), and the provisions of any Note and the other Loan Documents shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable Law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder; provided , however , if any Note or Related Indebtedness has been paid in full before the end of the stated term thereof, then Borrower, each other Loan Party, Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, shall, with reasonable promptness after Administrative Agent or such Lender discovers or is advised by Borrower or any other Loan Party that interest was received in an amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, either refund such excess interest to Borrower or such other Loan Party, as applicable, and/or credit such excess interest against such Note and/or any Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrower and the other Loan Parties to Administrative Agent or such Lender. Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that as a condition precedent to any claim seeking usury penalties against Administrative Agent or such Lender, Borrower will provide written notice to Administrative Agent or any Lender, advising Administrative Agent or such Lender in reasonable detail of the nature and amount of the violation, and Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice in which to correct such usury violation, if any, by either refunding such excess interest to Borrower or such other Loan Parties, as applicable, or crediting such excess interest against the Note to which the alleged violation relates and/or the Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrower and the other Loan Parties to Administrative Agent or such Lender. All sums contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by Administrative Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of any debt evidenced by any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be amortized or spread, using the actuarial method, throughout the stated term of such Note and/or the Related Indebtedness (including any and all renewal and extension periods) until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate from time to time in effect and applicable to such Note and/or the Related Indebtedness for so long as debt is outstanding. In no event shall the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts and revolving triparty accounts) apply to the Notes and/or any of the Related Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Administrative Agent or any Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration. 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 139 42297167v.11 

Section 12.20	 Ceiling Election . To the extent that any Lender is relying on Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code to determine the Maximum Rate payable on any Note and/or any other portion of the Obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender will utilize the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect as provided in such Chapter 303 . To the extent United States federal Law permits any Lender to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest than under Texas Law, such Lender will rely on United States federal Law instead of such Chapter 303 for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate. Additionally, to the extent permitted by applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, any Lender may, at its option and from time to time, utilize any other method of establishing the Maximum Rate under such Chapter 303 or under other applicable Law by giving notice, if required, to Borrower as provided by applicable Law now or hereafter in effect. 
 Section 12.21	 USA PATRIOT Act Notice .

Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Revolving Credit Loans under this Agreement and (y) with respect to a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Credit Lender, Cash Collateralize L/C Issuer s future Fronting Exposure, if any, with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.6 ; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to Lenders or L/C Issuer as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or L/C Issuer against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that, if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations are held by Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility without giving effect to Section 11.22(a)(iv) .

 (iii)	 Certain Fees . 
 (A)	No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.3(c) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 
 (B)	Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.6 . 
 (C)	With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.3(c) or to any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Revolving Credit Lender that is a Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to L/C Issuer s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.

All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Revolving Credit Lenders that are Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment. Subject to Section 11.28 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 (v)	 Cash Collateral .

 (b)	 Defaulting Lender Cure . If Borrower, Administrative Agent, and L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 11.22(a)(iv) ), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
 Section 12.23	 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it or other obligations hereunder, resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall: 
 (a)	notify Administrative Agent of such fact; and 
 (b)	purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:

 Borrower and each other Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against Borrower or such other Loan Party, as applicable, rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Borrower or such other Loan Party in the amount of such participation.

The obligations of Lenders and L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 Section 12.25	 Setoff .

 Section 12.30	 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs . To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, QFC Credit Support and each such QFC a Supported QFC ), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the Laws of the State of Texas and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 146 42297167v.11

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the Laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

 ARTICLE 13. GUARANTY 
 Section 13.1	 Guaranty. In consideration of the Loans, advances and other credit heretofore or hereafter granted by the Secured Parties to Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and in further consideration of any Bank Product Agreements, Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably, guarantee to the Secured Parties, the due and punctual payment when and as due, including at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, and the due fulfillment and performance of the Obligations.

It is not necessary for Administrative Agent, in order to enforce such payment by Guarantors, first to institute suit or exhaust its remedies against Borrower or others liable on the Obligations, or to enforce its rights against any security given to secure such Obligations. Administrative Agent is not required to mitigate damages or take any other action to reduce, collect or enforce the Obligations. No setoff, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation, or any defense of any kind which any Guarantor has or may have against Borrower or any Secured Party shall be available hereunder to Guarantors. No payment by any Guarantor shall discharge the liability of Guarantors hereunder until the Obligations have been fully satisfied and the Release Date shall have occurred. If Administrative Agent must rescind or restore any payment, or any part thereof, received by Administrative Agent on any part of the Obligations, any prior release or discharge from the terms of this 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 147 42297167v.11 

Guaranty given Guarantors by Administrative Agent or any reduction of any Guarantor s liability hereunder shall be without effect, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect.

 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 148 42297167v.11 

(d)	agrees that such Guarantor is obligated to pay the Obligations when due, notwithstanding any occurrence, circumstance, event, action or omission whatsoever, whether or not particularly described herein, except for the full and final payment and satisfaction of the Obligations;

 (h)	waives each right to which it may be entitled by virtue of the Laws of the State of Texas governing or relating to suretyship and guaranties, including, without limitation, any rights under Rule 31 , Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Chapter 51 of the Texas Property Code, Section 17.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, Section 3.605 of the Uniform Commercial Code, and Chapter 43 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, as any or all of the same may be amended or construed from time to time, or the common law of the State of Texas at all relevant times; and 
 (i)	represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that such Guarantor (a) has received, or will receive, direct or indirect benefit from the making of the Guaranty and the Obligations, (b) is familiar with, and has independently reviewed the books and records regarding, the financial condition of Borrower and is familiar with the value of any and all Collateral intended to be created as security for the payment of the Obligations, but such Guarantor is not relying on such financial condition, such Collateral, or the agreement of any other party as an inducement to enter into this Agreement and provide the Guaranty. Each Guarantor confirms that neither Administrative Agent, any Lender, any other Guarantor, nor any other party has made any representation, warranty or statement to such Guarantor in order to induce such Guarantor to execute this Agreement and provide the Guaranty, and (c) is a Qualified ECP Guarantor. 
 Section 13.4	 Liability. The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty is irrevocable, absolute and unconditional, without regard to the liability of any other Person, and shall not in any manner be affected by reason of any action taken or not taken by Administrative Agent and/or any other Secured Party, which action or inaction is herein consented and agreed to, nor by the partial or complete unenforceability or invalidity of any other guaranty or surety agreement, pledge, assignment or other security for any of the Obligations. No delay in making demand on Sureties or any of them for satisfaction of the liability hereunder shall prejudice Administrative Agent s right to enforce such satisfaction. All of Administrative Agent s rights and remedies shall be cumulative and any failure of Administrative Agent to 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 149 42297167v.11 

exercise any right hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to exercise the same or any other right at any time, and from time to time, thereafter. This is a continuing guaranty of payment, not a guaranty of collection, and this Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantors regardless of how long before or after the date hereof any of the Obligations were or are incurred. 
 Section 13.5	 Subordination . If Borrower or any other Loan Party is now or hereafter becomes indebted to one or more Guarantors (such indebtedness and all interest thereon is referred to as the Affiliated Debt ), such Affiliated Debt shall be subordinate in all respects to the full payment and performance of the Obligations, and no Guarantor shall be entitled to enforce or receive payment with respect to any Affiliated Debt until the Release Date. Each Guarantor agrees that any Liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, judgment liens, charges or other encumbrances upon any Loan Party s assets securing the payment of the Affiliated Debt shall be and remain subordinate and inferior to any Liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, judgment liens, charges or other encumbrances upon any Loan Party s assets securing the payment of the Obligations, and without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, no Guarantor shall exercise or enforce any creditor s rights of any nature against any Loan Party to collect the Affiliated Debt (other than demand payment therefor). In the event of the receivership, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, debtor s relief or other insolvency proceedings involving Borrower or any applicable Loan Party as a debtor, Administrative Agent has the right and authority, either in its own name or as attorney-in-fact for any applicable Guarantor, to file such proof of debt, claim, petition or other documents and to take such other steps as are necessary to prove its rights hereunder and receive directly from the receiver, trustee or other court custodian, payments, distributions or other dividends which would otherwise be payable upon the Affiliated Debt. Each Guarantor hereby assigns such payments, distributions and dividends to Administrative Agent, and irrevocably appoints Administrative Agent as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with authority to make and file in the name of such Guarantor any proof of debt, amendment of proof of debt, claim, petition or other document in such proceedings and to receive payment of any sums becoming distributable on account of the Affiliated Debt, and to execute such other documents and to give acquittances therefor and to do and perform all such other acts and things for and on behalf of such Guarantor as may be necessary in the opinion of Administrative Agent in order to have the Affiliated Debt allowed in any such proceeding and to receive payments, distributions or dividends of or on account of the Affiliated Debt. 
 Section 13.6	 Subrogation . No Guarantor waives or releases any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or contribution which such Guarantor may have, after full and final payment of the Obligations, against others liable on the Obligations. Each Guarantor s rights of subrogation and reimbursement are subordinate in all respects to the rights and claims of Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and no Guarantor may exercise any rights it may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guaranty, by payment made hereunder or otherwise, until the Release Date. If any amount is paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights prior to the Release Date, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent and/or the other Secured Parties to be credited and applied on the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 
 Section 13.7	 Other Indebtedness or Obligations of Guarantors . If any Guarantor is or becomes liable for any indebtedness owed by any Loan Party to the Lenders by endorsement or otherwise than under this Guaranty, such liability shall not be affected by this Guaranty, and the rights of Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder shall be cumulative of all other rights that Administrative Agent and the Lenders may have against such Guarantor. The exercise by Administrative Agent of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other instrument or at law or in equity shall not preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other instrument or remedy at law or in equity and shall not preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy. Further, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Guaranty is given by Guarantors as an additional guaranty to all guaranties heretofore or hereafter executed and delivered to Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders by Guarantors 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 150 42297167v.11 

in favor of Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders relating to the indebtedness of Borrower and the other Loan Parties to the Secured Parties, and nothing herein shall be deemed to replace or be in lieu of any other of such previous or subsequent guarantees. 
 Section 13.8	 Costs and Expenses . Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent and the Lenders, upon demand, all losses and costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by Administrative Agent and the Lenders in attempting to cause the Obligations to be satisfied or in attempting to cause satisfaction of Guarantors liability under this Guaranty. 
 Section 13.9	 Exercising Rights, Etc . No notice to or demand upon any Guarantor in any case shall, of itself, entitle such Guarantor or any other Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No delay or omission by Administrative Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall impair such right or power or be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right or power hereunder. 
 Section 13.10	 Benefit; Binding Effect . This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party and their respective successors and assigns, and to any interest in any of the Obligations. All of the obligations of Guarantors arising hereunder shall be jointly and severally binding on each of the Persons signing this Guaranty, and their respective successors and assigns provided, however , that no Guarantor may, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent in each instance, assign or delegate any of its rights, powers, duties or obligations hereunder, and any attempted assignment or delegation made without Administrative Agent s prior written consent shall be void ab initio and of no force or effect). 
 Section 13.11	 Multiple Guarantors . It is specifically agreed that Administrative Agent may enforce the provisions hereof with respect to one or more Guarantors without seeking to enforce the same as to all or any Guarantors. If one or more additional guaranty agreements Other Guaranties are executed by one or more additional guarantors Other Guarantors ), which guarantee, in whole or in part, any of the Obligations, it is specifically agreed that Administrative Agent may enforce the provisions of this Guaranty or of Other Guaranties with respect to one or more of Guarantors or any one or more of Other Guarantors under the Other Guaranties without seeking to enforce the provisions of this Guaranty or the Other Guaranties as to all or any of Guarantors or Other Guarantors. Each Guarantor hereby waives any requirement of joinder of all or any other Guarantor or all or any of the Other Guarantors in any suit or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Guaranty or of the Other Guaranties. The liability hereunder of all Guarantors hereunder shall be joint and several. 
 Section 13.12	 Additional Guarantors . From time to time subsequent to the date hereof, additional Persons may become parties hereto as additional Guarantors (each, an Additional Guarantor ), by executing a Guarantor Joinder Agreement. Upon delivery of any such Guarantor Joinder Agreement to Administrative Agent, notice of which is hereby waived by Guarantors, each Additional Guarantor shall be a Guarantor and shall be as fully a party hereto as if Additional Guarantor were an original signatory hereto. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that its obligations arising hereunder shall not be affected or diminished by the addition or release of any other Guarantor hereunder, nor by any election of Administrative Agent not to cause any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Borrower to become an Additional Guarantor hereunder. This Guaranty shall be fully effective as to any Guarantor that is or becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any other Person becomes or fails to become or ceases to be a Guarantor hereunder. 
 Section 13.13	 Reinstatement . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Article 12 shall be automatically 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT Page 151 42297167v.11 

reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify each Secured Party on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by such Person in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any Debtor Relief Law. 
 Section 13.14	 Maximum Liability . Anything in this Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable Law (collectively, the Fraudulent Transfer Laws ), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor in respect of intercompany indebtedness to other Loan Parties or Affiliates of other Loan Parties to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid or Property conveyed by such Guarantor under the Loan Documents) and after giving effect as assets, subject to Section 12.6 , to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to (a) applicable Law or (b) any agreement providing for an equitable allocation among such Guarantor and other Loan Parties of obligations arising under the Loan Documents and Bank Product Agreements.
