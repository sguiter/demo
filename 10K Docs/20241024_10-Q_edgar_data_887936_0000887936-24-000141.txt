 Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA was enacted into law. The IRA, among other things, includes provisions that permit clean energy tax credits that are transferable to an unrelated third party in exchange for cash payment. When the control of the investment tax credits transfers, the acquired credits are recognized as deferred tax assets and are measured under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes. The difference between the purchase price and the tax basis of the purchased credits is recognized as deferred credits. The deferred credits are recognized in income tax expense in proportion to the reversal of the associated deferred tax asset. The amounts paid for the tax credits are presented in the Cash paid for income taxes and tax credits, net of tax refunds line in the supplemental cash flow disclosures.

 Unfulfilled performance obligations primarily consist of fees not yet recognized on certain fixed-fee, performance-based and contingent arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the remaining contract transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations was million and million, respectively. We expect to recognize the majority of the related revenues over the next months. We elected to utilize the optional exemption to exclude from this disclosure fixed-fee and performance-based and contingent arrangements with an original expected duration of one year or less and to exclude our time and expense arrangements for which revenues are recognized using the right-to-invoice practical expedient. 
 Contract assets are defined as assets for which we have recorded revenues but are not yet entitled to receive our fees because certain events, such as completion of the measurement period or client approval, must occur. The contract asset balance was immaterial as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and capital resources for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the United States U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). In addition to historical information, the following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, these expectations or any of the forward-looking statements could prove to be incorrect, and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 FTI Consulting, Inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company, we, our or FTI Consulting ), is a global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations manage change, mitigate risk and resolve disputes: financial, legal, operational, political regulatory, reputational and transactional. Individually, each of our segments and practices is staffed with experts recognized for the depth of their knowledge and a track record of making an impact. Collectively, FTI Consulting offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to assist clients across the business cycle, from proactive risk management to rapid response to unexpected events and dynamic environments. 
 We report financial results for the following five reportable segments: 
 Our Corporate Finance Restructuring Corporate Finance segment focuses on the strategic, operational, financial, transactional and capital needs of our clients around the world. Our clients include companies, boards of directors, investors, private equity sponsors, lenders, governments and other financing sources and creditor groups, as well as other parties-in-interest. We deliver a wide range of services centered around four core offerings: Business Transformation, Strategy, Transactions and Turnaround Restructuring. 
 Our Forensic and Litigation Consulting FLC segment provides law firms, companies, boards of directors, government entities, private equity firms and other interested parties with a multidisciplinary and independent range of services across risk and investigations and disputes, supported by our data analytics technology-enabled solutions, with a focus on highly regulated industries. Our services are centered around five core offerings: Construction, Projects Assets and Environmental Solutions, Data Analytics, Disputes, Healthcare Risk Management Advisory, and Risk and Investigations. 
 Our Economic Consulting segment, including subsidiary Compass Lexecon LLC, provides law firms, companies, government entities and other interested parties with analyses of complex economic issues for use in international arbitration, legal and regulatory proceedings, and strategic decision making and public policy debates around the world. We deliver a wide range of services centered around three core offerings: Antitrust Competition Economics, Financial Economics and International Arbitration. 
 Our Technology segment provides companies, law firms, private equity firms and government entities with a comprehensive global portfolio of digital insights and risk management consulting services. Our professionals help organizations better address risk as the growing volume and variety of enterprise and emerging data intersects with legal, regulatory and compliance needs. We deliver a wide range of expert and analytics-powered solutions driven by investigations, litigation, antitrust and competition, merger acquisition M A ), restructuring and compliance and risk through three core offerings: Corporate Legal Department Consulting, E-discovery Services and Expertise, and Information Governance, Privacy Security Services. 
 Our Strategic Communications segment develops and executes communications strategies to help management teams, boards of directors, law firms, governments and regulators manage change and mitigate risk surrounding transformational and disruptive events, including transactions, investigations, disputes, crises, regulation and legislation. We deliver a wide range of services centered around three core offerings: Corporate Reputation, Financial Communications and Public Affairs. 
 We derive substantially all of our revenues from providing professional services to both U.S. and international clients. Most of our services are rendered under time and expense contract arrangements, which require the client to pay us based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed-upon rates. Under this arrangement, we typically bill our clients for reimbursable expenses, including those relating to travel, out-of-pocket expenses, outside consultants and other outside service costs. Certain contracts are rendered under fixed-fee arrangements, which require the client to pay a fixed fee in exchange for a predetermined set of professional services. Fixed-fee arrangements may require certain clients to pay us a recurring retainer. 
 16 

Our contract arrangements may also contain success fees or performance-based arrangements in which our fees are based on the attainment of contractually defined objectives with our client. This type of success fee may supplement a time and expense or fixed-fee arrangement. Success fee revenues may cause variations in our revenues and operating results due to the timing of when achieving the performance-based criteria becomes probable. Seasonal factors, such as the timing of our employees and clients vacations and holidays, may impact the timing of our revenues across our segments. 
 In our Technology segment, certain clients are billed based on the amount of data storage used or the volume of information processed. Unit-based revenues are defined as revenues billed on a per item, per page or another unit-based method and include revenues from data processing and hosting. Unit-based revenues include revenues associated with licensed software products made available to customers via a web browser on-demand ). On-demand revenues are charged on a unit or monthly basis and include, but are not limited to, processing and review related functions. 
 Our financial results are primarily driven by: 
 the number, size and type of engagements we secure; 
 the rate per hour or fixed charges we charge our clients for services; 
 the utilization rates of the revenue-generating professionals we employ; 
 the timing of revenue recognition related to revenues subject to certain performance-based contingencies; 
 the number of revenue-generating professionals; 
 the types of assignments we are working on at different times; 
 the length of the billing and collection cycles; and 
 the geographic locations of our clients or locations in which services are rendered. 
 We define acquisition growth as revenues of acquired companies in the first 12 months following the effective date of an acquisition. When significant, we identify the impact of acquisition-related revenue growth. 
 When significant, we identify the estimated impact of foreign currency FX driven by our businesses with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar USD ). The estimated impact of FX on the period-to-period performance results is calculated as the difference between the prior period results, multiplied by the average FX exchange rates to USD in the current period and the prior period results, multiplied by the average FX exchange rates to USD in the prior period. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and segment financial information that may not be presented in our financial statements or prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). Certain of these financial measures are considered not in conformity with GAAP non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC rules. Specifically, we have referred to the following non-GAAP financial measures: 
 Total Segment Operating Income 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted Net Income 
 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
 Free Cash Flow 
 We have included the definitions of Segment Operating Income and Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which are GAAP financial measures, below in order to more fully define the components of certain non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying analysis of financial information. As described in Note 13, Segment Reporting in Part I, Item 1, of this 
 17 

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA, and Segment Operating Income is a component of the definition of Adjusted Segment EBITDA. 
 We define Segment Operating Income as a segment s share of consolidated operating income. We define Total Segment Operating Income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Segment Operating Income for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We use Segment Operating Income for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Segment EBITDA. We define Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a segment s share of consolidated operating income before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges and goodwill impairment charges. We use Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a basis to internally evaluate the financial performance of our segments because we believe it reflects current core operating performance and provides an indicator of the segment s ability to generate cash. 
 We define Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Adjusted Segment EBITDA for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as consolidated net income before income tax provision, other non-operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, gain or loss on sale of a business and losses on early extinguishment of debt. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our operating results, including underlying trends. In addition, EBITDA is a common alternative measure of operating performance used by many of our competitors. It is used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and others to value and compare the financial performance of companies in our industry. Therefore, we also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, considered along with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results with the operating results of other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share Adjusted EPS ), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as net income and earnings per diluted share EPS ), respectively, excluding the impact of remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, the gain or loss on sale of a business and losses on early extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted Net Income for the purpose of calculating Adjusted EPS. Management uses Adjusted EPS to assess total Company operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends. 
 We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash used in operating activities less cash payments for purchases of property and equipment. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with an additional understanding of the Company s ability to generate cash for ongoing business operations and other capital deployment. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable with other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, the information contained in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included elsewhere in this report.

 Third Quarter 2024 Executive Highlights 
 Revenues 
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 32.8 million, or 3.7 , to 926.0 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand and realized bill rates in our Economic Consulting segment and higher demand in our Technology segment, which was partially offset by lower demand and realized bill rates in our Corporate Finance segment. 
 Net income 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 16.9 million, or 20.2 , to 66.5 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in direct compensation and selling, general and administrative SG A expenses and an FX remeasurement loss compared to a gain in the same quarter in the prior year, which was partially offset by higher revenues. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15.8 million, or 13.3 , to 102.9 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 11.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in direct compensation and SG A expenses, which was partially offset by higher revenues. 
 EPS and Adjusted EPS 
 EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.49 to 1.85 compared to 2.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in EPS was primarily due to lower net income as described above. 
 Adjusted EPS was equal to EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Allocation 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 112.7 million, or 105.6 , to 219.4 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash collections. D ays sales outstanding DSO of 108 days at September 30, 2024 compared to 114 days at September 30, 2023. The decrease in DSO was primarily due to cash collections that outpaced the increase in revenues. 
 Free Cash Flow for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 119.9 million, or 129.6 , to 212.3 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above, and a decrease in net cash used for purchases of property and equipment.

 Revenues and operating income 
 See Segment Results for an expanded discussion of revenues, gross profit and SG A expenses. 
 Unallocated corporate expenses 
 Unallocated corporate expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11.7 million, or 42.5 , to 39.3 million compared to 27.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Interest income and other 
 Interest income and other, which includes FX gains and losses, decreased 6.1 million to a 0.9 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 5.1 million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 2.5 million FX loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 2.8 million FX gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 FX gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, as well as third-party and intercompany receivables and payables.

Our effective tax rate of 25.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the income tax provision was primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax provision, which was partially offset by a higher tax rate related to an unfavorable tax return adjustment as compared to the prior year income tax provision.

Our effective tax rate of 20.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the income tax provision was primarily due to a favorable tax benefit related to share-based compensation, as a larger number of non-qualified stock options were exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, and a decrease in foreign taxes as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) The number of revenue-generating professionals for the Technology segment excludes as-needed professionals, who we employ based on demand for the segment s services. We employed an average of 855 as-needed employees during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 792 as-needed employees during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (2) We calculate the utilization rate for our billable professionals by dividing the number of hours that all of our billable professionals worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for all of our billable professionals during the same period. Available hours are determined by the standard hours worked by each employee, adjusted for part-time hours, U.S. standard work weeks and local country holidays. Available working hours include vacation and professional training days, but exclude holidays. Utilization rates are presented for our segments that primarily bill clients on an hourly basis. We have not presented utilization rates for our Technology and Strategic Communications segments as most of the revenues of these segments are not generated on an hourly basis. 
 (3) For engagements where revenues are based on number of hours worked by our billable professionals and fixed-fee arrangements, average billable rate per hour is calculated by dividing revenues (excluding revenues from success fees, pass-through revenues and outside consultants) for a period by the number of hours worked on client assignments during the same period. We have not presented average billable rates per hour for our Technology and Strategic Communications segments as most of the revenues of these segments are not based on billable hours.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenues, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies, on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on current facts and circumstances, historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting estimates that reflect our more significant judgments, and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 There were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Critical Accounting Estimates in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or from the information provided in Part II, Item 8, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 SIGNIFICANT NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 See Note 2, New Accounting Standards in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Our annual cash flows from operations generally exceed our cash needs for capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We typically finance our day-to-day operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases through cash flows from operations. During the first quarter of each fiscal year, our cash needs generally exceed our cash flows from operations due to the payment of annual incentive compensation. We believe that our cash flows from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our Credit Facility, as necessary, will provide adequate cash to fund our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 Our operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of billed and unbilled accounts receivable, notes receivable from employees, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued compensation expenses. The timing of billings and collections of receivables, as well as compensation and vendor payments, affects the changes in these balances. 
 Results of operations for our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated from the designated functional currency to our reporting currency of USD. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for each month, while assets and liabilities are translated at balance sheet date exchange rates. Resulting net translation adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders equity in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 Uncertainties and Trends Affecting Liquidity 
 Our conclusion that we will be able to fund our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months by using existing capital resources and cash generated from operations does not take into account events beyond our control that could result in a material adverse impact on our business, the impact of any future acquisitions or unexpected significant changes in the number of employees or other unanticipated uses of cash. The anticipated cash needs of our business could change significantly if we pursue and complete additional business acquisitions, if our business plans change, if events such as economic, political and workforce disruptions arise, including any impact of future public health crises, political situations, or economic or business conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated, or if unexpected circumstances or other events 
 31 

beyond our control arise that may have a material adverse effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business, including material negative changes in the health and welfare of our employees or those of our clients, and the operating performance or financial results of our business. Any of these events or circumstances, including any new business opportunities, could involve significant additional funding and could require us to borrow under our Credit Facility or raise additional debt or equity funding to meet those needs. Our ability to borrow or raise additional capital, if necessary, is subject to a variety of factors that we cannot predict with certainty, including: 
 our future profitability; 
 the quality of our accounts receivable; 
 our relative levels of debt and equity; 
 the volatility and overall condition of the capital markets; and 
 the market prices of our securities. 
 Any new debt funding, if available, may be on terms less favorable to us than our Credit Facility. See Forward-Looking Statements in Part I, Item 2, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the information contained under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (1) DSO is a performance measure used to assess how quickly revenues are collected by the Company. We calculate DSO at the end of each reporting period by dividing net accounts receivable reduced by billings in excess of services provided, by revenues for the quarter, adjusted for changes in FX rates. We multiply the result by the number of days in the quarter. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 79.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in operating activities of 158.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 238.3 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash collections, which was partially offset by an increase in salaries largely related to annual salary increases and headcount growth, and higher annual bonus payments, forgivable loan issuances, operating expenses and income tax payments as compared to the same period in the prior year. DSO was 108 and 114 days as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in DSO was primarily due to cash collections that outpaced the increase in revenues. 
 Net ca sh provided by investing activities of 3.5 million for th e nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cas h used in inv esting activities of 67.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 71.1 million in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a 24.4 million payment for a short-term investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the maturity of the short-term investment of 25.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, there was a 21.5 million decrease in capital expenditures primarily driven by lower spend on leasehold improvements and cloud computing costs as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 67.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 62.2 million, or 92.7 , in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of the 315.8 million principal amount of our 2023 Convertible Notes at maturity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 21.0 million in payments for common stock repurchases 
 32 

under the Repurchase Program and an increase in proceeds on stock option exercises of 9.4 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in net borrowings of 285.0 million under our Credit Facility as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents had a favorable impact of 4.7 million and 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash paid for income taxes and tax credits, net of tax refunds included 23.5 million of payments for the purchase of tax credits. 
 Principal Sources of Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our capital resources included 386.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity of 900.0 million under the revolving line of credit under our Credit Facility. The 900.0 million revolving line of credit under our Credit Facility includes a 125.0 million sublimit for borrowings in currencies other than USD, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen. 
 The availability of borrowings, as well as issuances and extensions of letters of credit under our Credit Facility, are subject to specified conditions. Subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity, we will be able to invite existing and new lenders to increase the size of the facility up to a maximum of 1.2 billion. See Note 8, Debt in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of borrowing rates and guarantees under the Credit Facility. 
 The second amended and restated credit agreement entered into on November 21, 2022 (the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facility and our other indebtedness outstanding from time to time contains covenants that, among other things, may limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends on our capital stock, make distributions or repurchases of our capital stock or make specified other restricted payments; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; guarantee obligations of other entities or our foreign subsidiaries; enter into hedging agreements; enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons; or engage in any business other than consulting-related businesses. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio (the ratio of funded debt (less unrestricted cash up to 300.0 million) to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. See Note 8, Debt in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of the Credit Agreement. 
 Principal Uses of Capital Resources 
 Future Capital Requirements 
 We anticipate that our future capital requirements will principally consist of funds required for: 
 operating and general corporate expenses relating to the operation of our businesses; 
 capital expenditures, primarily for information technology equipment and information or financial systems, office furniture and leasehold improvements; 
 debt service requirements, including interest payments on our long-term debt; 
 compensation to designated executive management and senior managing directors under our various long-term incentive compensation programs; 
 discretionary funding of the Repurchase Program; 
 contingent obligations related to our acquisitions; 
 potential acquisitions of businesses; and 
 other known future contractual obligations. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent 21.7 million in capital expenditures to support our organization, including direct support for specific client engagements. For the remainder of 2024, we currently expect additional capital expenditures to support our organization in an aggregate amount of between 14 million and 17 million. Our estimate takes into consideration the needs of our existing businesses but does not include the impact of any purchases that we may be required to make as a result of future acquisitions or specific client engagements that are not completed or not currently 
 33 

contemplated. Our capital expenditure requirements may change if our staffing levels or technology needs change significantly from what we currently anticipate, if we are required to purchase additional equipment specifically to support new client engagements, or if we pursue and complete additional acquisitions. 
 Future Contractual Obligations 
 We have no future contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 related to outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. For more information on our Credit Facility, refer to Note 8, Debt in Part I, Item 1 . Future contractual obligations exclude any revolving line of credit borrowings or repayments subsequent to September 30, 2024 and prior to the November 21, 2027 maturity date of our Credit Facility. Under our operating leases as described in Note 9, Leases in Part I, Item 1, we have current obligations of 36.2 million and non-current obligations of 217.0 million. 
 These amounts reflect future unconditional payments and are based on the terms of the relevant agreements, appropriate classification of items under GAAP currently in effect and certain assumptions such as interest rates. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to claims, asserted or unasserted, or named as a party to lawsuits or investigations. Litigation, in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty and in the case of more complex legal proceedings such as intellectual property and securities litigation, the results are difficult to predict at all. We are not aware of any asserted or unasserted legal proceedings or claims that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations.

 There have been no material changes in any risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). We may disclose changes to risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.
