On
December 15, 2023, the Company consummated its previously announced transaction contemplated by that certain Contribution and Exchange
Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2023 (the Contribution and Exchange Agreement ), by and between the Company and Orebits
Acquisition Group OAG ), a Wyoming limited liability company and an entity owned and controlled by Carlos Montoya, the

The
Company follows ASC 350-30-35 and recognizes costs incurred to renew or extend the term of a recognized intangible asset as an expense
in the period in which they are incurred. These costs are not capitalized but are instead treated as operating expenses, ensuring that
the financial statements accurately reflect the current period s operational activities. 

A
financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term financial instruments, short-term
loans, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payables and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their
fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amount of our debt approximates fair value because the interest rates on these
instruments approximate the interest rate on debt with similar terms available to us. 

. 

Stock-based
compensation issued to employees and members of our board of directors is measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value
of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. The grant date fair value of a stock-based award is recognized as an expense over the requisite
service period of the award on a straight-line basis. 

For
purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock-based compensation issued to employees, the Company performs an
analysis of current market data and historical data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility, the expected term of the option and
the expected forfeiture rate. With the exception of the expected forfeiture rate, which is not an input, we use these estimates as variables
in the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Depending upon the number of stock options granted any fluctuations in these calculations
could have a material effect on the results presented in our statements of operations. In addition, any differences between estimated
forfeitures and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our financial statements.

Business
Overview 

Organization
and Corporate History 

I-ON
is a leading-edge provider of asset-digitization and securitization solutions engineered to provide a secure, fast, transparent, and
institutional-grade ecosystem. We specialize in digitizing documentary evidence of ownership into secure, asset-backed digital certificates,
thus bringing liquidity and recognized value to a diverse array of asset classes. Our cutting-edge technology includes a zero-trust,
hybrid blockchain architecture that incorporates state-of-the-art smart contracts and sophisticated workflow management AI technologies.
This system enables the digitization of ownership records for recoverable gold, precious metals, and mineral reserves, transforming them
into digital certificates that facilitate wealth transfer through innovative asset-backed financial instruments. 

In
2023, I-ON continued to expand its market presence and product offerings. We notably acquired Orebits gold digitization patent
portfolio, trademarks, brand marks, and core intellectual property (see Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements). This acquisition
has allowed us to enhance our capabilities and broaden our service offerings, particularly through a new SaaS platform designed for banks,
broker-dealers, and other financial intermediaries. This platform supports the receipt, management, and reporting of digital assets,
reinforcing our commitment to innovation in the banking, financial technology, and mineral asset industries.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation.
A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements. We have identified below the accounting
policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which
require the application of significant judgment by our management. Management has carefully considered the recently issued accounting
pronouncements that altered generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any other new or modified principles will
have a material impact on the Company s reported financial position or operations in the near term.

Item
 4. 
 Controls
 and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, carried out
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the last day of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation,
our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not fully effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our principal executive and financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or
our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), will prevent or detect
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. The design of our control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and
that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts
of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is
also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any
particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) that occurred during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.
