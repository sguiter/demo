of its outstanding common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock and warrant to purchase common stock were adjusted
to reflect the 1-for-75,000 reverse split, with respective exercise prices of the warrants proportionately increased. The conversion prices
of the outstanding convertible notes and certain series of preferred stock were adjusted to reflect a proportional decrease in the number
of shares of common stock to be issued upon conversion. 

All share and per share data throughout these
consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. The total number of authorized
shares of common stock did not change. As a result of the reverse stock split, an amount equal to the decreased value of the common stock
was reclassified from common stock to additional paid-in capital.

The balance of accounts receivable, net as of January 1, 2023 was . 

Medical equipment 

Leasehold improvements 

t recognize
any goodwill impairment. The Company based this decision on impairment testing of the underlying assets, expected cash flows, decreased
asset value and other factors. 

Accordingly, the Company recognizes net revenue when the patient receives
orthopedic care services. The Company s patient service contracts generally have performance obligations which are satisfied at
a point in time. The performance obligation is for onsite or off-site care provided. Patient service contracts are generally fixed-price,
and the transaction price is in the contract. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with the Company s
patients are satisfied; generally, at the time of patient care. 

In determining net revenue to record under ASC
606, the Company must estimate the transaction price, including estimates of variable consideration in the contract at inception. In order
to estimate variable consideration, the Company uses established billings rates (also described as gross charges for the
procedures being performed, however, the billing rates are not the same as actual amounts recovered for the Company s healthcare
subsidiary. They generally do not reflect what the Company is ultimately paid by the customer, insurance carriers and other payors,
and therefore are not reported in the consolidated financial statements at that rate. The Company is typically paid amounts based on established
charges per procedure with guidance from the annually updated Current Procedural Terminology CPT guidelines that designates
relative value units and a suggested range of charges for each procedure which is then assigned a CPT code. This gross charge is discounted
to reflect the percentage paid to the Company using a modifier recognized by each insurance carrier for services, less deductible, co-pay,
and contractual adjustments which are deducted from the calculated fee. These adjustments are considered variable consideration under
ASC 606 and are deducted from the calculated fee to arrive at the net transaction price. The Company also estimates changes in the contract
price as a result of price concessions, changes to deductibles, co-pays and other contractual adjustments to determine the eventual settlement
amount the Company expects to receive. The Company uses the term settlement realization in its disclosures to describe the amount of cash
the Company expects to receive based on its estimate of the transaction price under the expected value method of ASC 606. 

Where appropriate, the Company utilizes the expected
value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration, which has been based on a historical 12-month
lookback of its actual settlement realization rates. The estimates of reserves established for variable consideration reflect current
contractual requirements, the Company s historical experience, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted
patient data and settlement patterns. Settlement realization patterns are assessed based on actual settlements and based on expected settlement
realization trends obtained from discussions with attorneys, doctors and our third-party medical billing company. Settlement amounts are
negotiated, and prolonged settlement negotiations are not indicative of a greater likelihood of reduced settlement realization or zero
settlement. 

The Company may accept a lower settlement realization
rate in order to receive faster payment. The Company obtains information about expected settlement realization trends from discussions
with doctors and attorneys and its third-party medical billing company vendor, which handles settlement claims and negotiations. Settlement
amounts are presented to the Company s third-party medical billing company vendor. 

Settlement rates of 49 or higher based on gross
billed amounts are typically accepted without further negotiation. Proposed settlement rates below 49 are negotiated when possible and
longer negotiations typically result in higher settlement rates. If the Company accepts a lower settlement realization rate in order to
receive payments more quickly, the Company considers that a price concession and estimates these concessions at contract inception. The
various forms of variable consideration described above included in the transaction price may be constrained and are included in net revenue
only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in
a future period. The Company has not constrained any of its estimates of variable consideration for any of the periods presented. 

The Company satisfies performance obligations
as services are performed and then billed to the patient. Payment in most cases is made by an attorney for such services to our patients
which are due upon final settlement of patients claims. During the claims process, legal counsel warranties such claim through the letter
of protection, which is sent to the Company, as a medical provider, on behalf of the client patient. This letter states that the attorney
is responsible for paying the client s medical bills when the case is fully developed and settles. The medical professional agrees
to provide treatment to the injured person and refrain from attempting to collect payment as it is developing and until the case is resolved.
Once the personal injury case is finalized with the insurance company, the attorney pays the outstanding medical bills from the settlement. 

million reduction in its accounts receivable and revenue during
the third quarter of 2024 related to the change in estimate. Additionally, as a result of this reduced settlement realization experience,
the Company recorded reductions to net revenue of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

The Company will continue to evaluate its estimate
of its settlement realization rates in the future, which will include a monthly review of the Company s trailing 24-month historical
settlement realization rate, along with estimates of current and pending settlements through ongoing discussions with attorneys, doctors
and the Company s third-party medical billing company in order to determine its variable consideration under ASC 606 and the net
transaction price. The Company will update its settlement realization rate estimate used in determining its accounts receivable and revenue
each quarter based on this review. 

of its accounts receivable in exchange for cash of . The Company ceased factoring of accounts receivable

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The Company recognized advertising and marketing expense of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. 

ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how
companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to
be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely
than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be
measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
did t have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 

as of September 30, 2024. These factors raise a substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result if
the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern and the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash infusions. Management
is in continuous discussions with prospective investors and believes the raising of capital will allow the Company to fund its cash flow
shortfalls and pursue new acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient capital from debt
or equity transactions or from operations in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to it. Should the Company be unable to raise
sufficient funds, it may be required to curtail its operating plans. In addition, if overall Company expenses increase, the Company may
need to implement cost reductions. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis,
or at all, in the future. Should the Company not be able to raise sufficient funds, it may cause cessation of operations. 

with additional paid-in-capital related with a executed on January 9, 2024. The impact
of this adjustment decreased to common stock and offsetting increase to additional paid-in-capital as of December 31, 2023. 

On November 10, 2023, the Company sold Platinum
Tax, which was a full-service tax resolution firm located in Los Angeles, California. The Company presented in prior periods operating
loss as loss from discontinued operations of 3,705 and 93,005 on the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

The impact of the error corrections also reflected
a 136.12 increase of basic earnings per share, and a 2.30 increase of diluted earnings per share on the consolidated statement of operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the impact of the error correction reflected
a 167.33 increase of basic earnings per share, and an increase of 2.40 of diluted earnings per share.

the corrections on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023, the condensed consolidated statement

Overview 

We are an acquisition holding company focused
on locating undervalued and undercapitalized companies, primarily in the healthcare industry, and providing them capitalization and leadership
to maximize the value and potential of their private enterprises while also providing diversification and risk mitigation for our stockholders.
Specifically, we have and will continue to look at a diverse variety of acquisitions in the healthcare sector in terms of growth stages
and capital structures and we intend to focus our portfolio of subsidiaries approximately as follows: 80 will be targeted to established
profitable niche small to mid-sized healthcare companies and 20 will be targeted to second stage startups in healthcare and related financial
services (emerging businesses with a strong organic growth plan that is materially cash generative). 

On May 31, 2021, we acquired Nova Ortho and Spine,
LLC, or Nova, which operates a group of regional primary specialty and ancillary care facilities throughout Florida that provide traumatic
injury victims with primary care evaluations, interventional pain management, and specialty consultation services. We focus on plaintiff
related care are and a highly efficient provider of emergency medical condition, or EMC, assessments. We provide a full range of diagnostic
and surgical services for injuries and disorders of the skeletal system and associated bones, joints, tendons, muscles, ligaments, and
nerves. From sports injuries, to sprains, strains, and fractures, our doctors are dedicated to helping patients return to active lifestyles. 

We also own a real estate company, Edge View Properties,
Inc., or Edge View, which we acquired on July 16, 2014. Edge View owns five (5) acres zoned medium density residential (MDR) with 12 lots
already platted, six (6) acres zoned high-density residential (HDR) that can be platted in various configurations to meet current
housing needs, and twelve (12) acres zoned in Lemhi County as Agriculture that is available for further annexation into the City of Salmon
for development, as well as a common area for landowners to view wildlife, provide access to the Salmon River and fishing in a two (2)
acre pond. Management has invested years working to develop a new and exciting housing development in Salmon, Idaho and plans to
enter into a joint venture agreement with a developer for this planned concept development. 

All of our operations are conducted through, and
our income derived from, our two subsidiaries. 

Segments 

As of September 30, 2024, we had two reportable
operating segments as determined by management using the management approach as defined by the authoritative guidance on
 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information . 

(1) 
 Healthcare (Nova) 

(2) 
 Real Estate (Edge View) 

These segments are a result of differences in
the nature of the products and services sold. Corporate administration costs, which include, but are not limited to, general accounting,
human resources, legal and credit and collections, are partially allocated to the three operating segments. Other revenue consists of
nonrecurring items. 

48 

The healthcare segment provides a full range of
diagnostic and surgical services for injuries and disorders of the skeletal system and associated bones, joints, tendons, muscles, ligaments,
and nerves. 

The real estate segment consists of Edge View,
a real estate company that owns five (5) acres zoned medium density residential (MDR) with 12 lots already platted, six (6) acres zoned
high-density residential (HDR) that can be platted in various configurations to meet current housing needs, and twelve (12) acres
zoned in Lemhi County as Agriculture that is available for further annexation into the City of Salmon for development, as well as a common
area for landowners to view wildlife, provide access to the Salmon River and fishing in a two (2) acre pond. 

Management uses numerous tools and methods to
evaluate and measure our subsidiaries success. To help succeed, management retains the prior owners of the subsidiaries and allows
them to do what they do best is run the business. Additionally, management monitors key metrics primarily revenues and net income from
operations. 

Discontinued Operations

Revenue . For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023, all of our revenue was generated by our healthcare segment, which generates revenue through a full range
of diagnostic and surgical services. Our total revenue decreased by 2,050,218, or 60.20 , to 1,355,641 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 from 3,405,859 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to the following
factors: 

The 2024 third quarter revenue was negatively impacted by the hurricanes that occurred in Florida during
this timeframe. The harsh weather caused several of our facilities to shut down for periods of time due to storm damage as well as patients
not being able to attend their appointments. All of our facilities have reopened. 
 
 Prior to fiscal year 2024 we historically realized a 49 settlement rate from total gross billed charges.
Accordingly, we had historically recognized net healthcare service revenue as 49 of gross billed amounts. Throughout the first half of
2024 as well as the third quarter of 2024, we underwent efforts to accelerate cash settlement of our accounts receivable to generate cash
flow for operations. We did this by shortening our settlement negotiations timespan with attorneys and insurance companies and accepting
lower settlement amounts. We expect this trend to continue in the short term as we work to settle our accounts receivables more quickly
to generate cash flow for operations. 
 
 Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, we completed a thorough review of our third-party billing
data, including reviewing historical reports and new reporting methods as a part of our updated analysis. Based upon this review it was
determined that a 24-month lookback period should be used in the analysis of our historical settlement realization rates. As a result
of the new efforts to accelerate cash settlement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized a 44 average settlement
rate of our gross billed charges during this time frame, which were historically recorded in accounts receivable and revenue at 49 of
gross billings. With the reduction in our estimate of our settlement realization rate from 49 to 44 , a 1,650,474 change in accounting
estimate was taken during the third quarter of 2024 in our accounts receivable and revenue. 

Cost of sales . Our cost of sales
consists of surgical center and laboratory fees, physician and professional fees, salaries and wages and medical supplies. Our total cost
of sales increased by 449,178, or 81.46 , to 1,000,601 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 551,423 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sale increased from 16.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2023
to 73.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is mainly attributable to increases in laboratory fees. 

Gross profit . As a result of the
foregoing, our total gross profit decreased by 2,499,396, or 87.56 , to 355,040 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,854,436
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our total gross margin (as a percent of revenue) decreased from 83.81 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 to 26.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Depreciation expense . Our depreciation
expense was 3,365, or 0.25 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,365, or 0.10 of revenue, for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses .
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting, auditing, legal and public reporting expenses, personnel
expenses, including employee salaries, bonuses plus related payroll taxes and stock compensation expense, advertising expenses, professional
advisor fees, rent expense, insurance and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by 359,158, or 62.17 , to 936,835 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 577,677 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 69.11 and 16.96 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Increases were primarily attributable to increases in salaries and wages
expense of 265,346, professional fees of 153,624, rent expense of 33,386, payroll taxes of 20,010, and board fee expense of 15,000,
offset by a decrease in management fees of 180,000. 

Total other income (expense) . We
had 1,392,808 in total other expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to total other expense, net, of
 288,168 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of
interest expense of 1,386,041 and other expense of 6,767. Other expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted
of interest expense of 226,119, amortization of debt discounts of 46,048, financing penalties and fees of 16,000 and other expense
of 1. 

50 

Discontinued operations . For the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 0 and 3,705, respectively. 

Net income (loss) . As a result of
the cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net loss was 1,977,968 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to net income of 1,981,521 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3,959,489.

Revenue . Our total revenue decreased
by 4,327,348, or 45.66 , to 5,149,416 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,476,764 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in revenue is mainly attributable to the following factors: 

The 2024 third quarter revenue was negatively impacted by the hurricanes that occurred in Florida during
this timeframe. The harsh weather caused several of our facilities to shut down for periods of time due to storm damage as well as patients
not being able to attend their appointments. All of our facilities have reopened. 

51 

Our mix of services provided during the first nine months of the year with lower settlement realization
rates from surgical procedures performed and an increase in the lower revenue pain management treatments being performed for approximately
the same number of patient visits in the current nine-month period as compared to the same nine-month period in the prior year, also contributed
to the decrease in revenue. 

Prior to fiscal year 2024, we historically realized a 49 settlement rate from total gross billed charges.
Accordingly, we had historically recognized net healthcare service revenue as 49 of gross billed amounts. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we underwent efforts to accelerate cash settlement of our accounts receivable throughout 2024 to generate cash flow
for operations. We did this by shortening our settlement negotiations timespan with attorneys insurance companies and accepting
lower settlement amounts. We expect this trend to continue in the short term as we work to settle our accounts receivables more quickly
to generate cash flow for operations. 

Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, we completed a thorough review of our third-party billing
data, including reviewing historical reports and new reporting methods as a part of our updated analysis. Based upon this review it was
determined that a 24-month lookback period should be used in the analysis of our historical settlement realization rates. As a result
of the new efforts to accelerate cash settlement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized a 44 average settlement
rate of our gross billed charges during this time frame, which were historically recorded in accounts receivable and revenue at 49 of
gross billings. Accordingly, we recorded a reduction to net revenue of 1,199,155 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally,
with the reduction in our estimate of our settlement realization rate from 49 to 44 , a 1,650,474 change in accounting estimate was
taken during the third quarter of 2024 in our accounts receivable and revenue. 

Cost of sales . Our total cost of
sales increased by 152,358, or 5.88 , to 2,741,765 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,589,407 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sale increased from 27.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
to 53.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase in laboratory fees. 

Gross profit . As a result of the
foregoing, our total gross profit decreased by 4,479,706, or 65.04 , to 2,407,651 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from
 6,887,357 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our total gross margin (as a percent of revenue) decreased from 72.68 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 46.76 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Depreciation expense . Our depreciation
expense was 10,096 or 0.20 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11,365, or 0.12 of revenue, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Share based compensation expense .
Our share-based compensation expense 300,225, or 5.83 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to stock issuances for investor relation services, stock issued to board
members and stock issued as compensation for new employment bonuses to management. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses .
Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 527,370, or 25.17 , to 2,622,981 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 from 2,095,611 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our selling, general and administrative
expenses were 50.94 and 22.11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Increases were primarily attributable
to increases in salaries and wages expense of 769,696, stock compensation expense of 93,600, professional fees of 60,367, investor
relations and public company fees of 71,431, insurance expense of 71,635 and rent expense of 100,000, offset by decreases in management
fees of 225,000, bad debt expense of 270,000, and penalties of 44,670. 

Total other expense . We had 1,755,694
in total other expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to total other expense, net, of 1,905,768 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of interest expense
of 1,803,657, amortization of debt discounts of 24,821, penalties and fees of 1,330, and other expenses of 4,720, offset by other
income of 78,834 for the gain on debt refinance. Other expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of interest
expense of 1,763,698, amortization of debt discounts of 94,664 and financing penalties and fees of 48,000, offset by a gain on debt
refinance and forgiveness of 390 and other income of 204. 

52 

Discontinued operations . For the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 111,312 and 93,005, respectively. 

Net income (loss) . As a result of
the cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,392,657, as compared
to net income of 2,781,608 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 5,174,265. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,949,000 in
cash. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from operations, sales of securities, advances from
stockholders and third-party and related party debt. 

We believe, based on our operating plan, that
current working capital and current and expected additional financing should be sufficient to fund operations and satisfy our obligations
as they come due for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date. However, additional funds from new financing and/or
future equity raises are required for continued operations and to execute our business plan and our strategy of acquiring additional businesses.
The funds required to sustain operations ranges between 600,000 to 1 million and additional funds execute our business plan will depend
on the size, capital structure and purchase price consideration that the seller of a target business deems acceptable in a given transaction.
The amount of funds needed to execute our business plan also depends on what portion of the purchase price of a target business the seller
of that business is willing to take in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries. Given these factors,
we believe that the amount of outside additional capital necessary to execute our business plan on the low end (assuming target company
sellers accept a significant portion of the purchase price in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries)
ranges between 4 million to 8 million. If, and to the extent, that sellers are unwilling to accept a significant portion of the purchase
price in seller notes and equity, then the cash required to execute our business plan could be as much as 10 million. 

We intend to raise capital for additional acquisitions
primarily through equity and debt financings. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The
incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial
covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. There
is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional businesses under the terms outlined above. 

The financial statements were prepared on a going
concern basis and do not include any adjustment with respect to these uncertainties. 

Summary of Cash Flow 

The following table provides detailed information
about our net cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Our net cash used in operating activities from
continuing operations was 3,996,905 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 557,542 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The primary drivers of our net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are our net loss
of 2,392,657, decreases of 1,492,966 in accounts receivable, 691,072 in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and 380,001 in
accrued officer s compensation, offset by share based compensation of 788,600. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our
net income of 2,781,608, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 733,125, an increase in accrued officer s compensation
of 514,000, bad debt expense of 270,000 and an increase in accrued interest of 380,020, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable
of 5,510,098, were the primary drivers for the cash used in operations. 

We monitor outstanding cases as they develop through
ongoing discussions with attorneys, doctors and our third-party medical billing company and additionally monitor our settlement realization
rates over time. We have two primary methods of accelerating our cash settlement of our revenue and related accounts receivable. The first
is through factoring our receivables, which was done in 2023, but ended prior to April 2023. The second method is through accepting lower
settlement amounts during the final negotiations of the settlement, which is coordinated through our third-party medical billing company.
When our third-party medical billing company is provided with a settlement amount of 49 of gross charges or greater they will accept.
When presented with a lower amount we will discuss the reasons for the reduced rate and negotiate a higher rate. Shortening our negotiation
timeframe will typically result in a lower settlement realization rate, but will accelerate the cash settlement of the outstanding accounts
receivable. We began employing this second method in 2024, which reduced our settlement realization rate as described below. We have employed
both methods from time to time to accelerate our cash settlement and may employ one or both in the future. 

Prior to April 2023, we factored (sold) the vast
majority of our accounts receivable to third party(s) to generate working capital to fund ongoing business operations and growth. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we factored a total of 544,196 of our accounts receivable in exchange for cash of 253,750.
We ceased factoring of accounts receivable in the first quarter of 2023. The most recent average realization time for accounts receivable
was approximately eighteen to twenty-four months from the initial date of service. Typically, a patient will have a series of dates of
service over an average of 12 to 16 months. 

Prior to fiscal year 2024, we historically realized
a 49 settlement rate from total gross billed charges. Accordingly, we had historically recognized net healthcare service revenue as 49 
of gross billed amounts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we underwent efforts to accelerate cash settlement of our accounts
receivable throughout 2024 to generate cash flow for operations. We did this by shortening our settlement negotiations with insurance
companies and accepting lower settlement amounts. We expect this trend to continue in the short term as we work to settle our accounts
receivables more quickly to generate cash flow for operations. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, we completed a thorough
review of our third-party billing data, including reviewing historical reports and new reporting methods as a part of our updated analysis.
Based upon this review it was determined that a 24-month lookback period should be used in the analysis of our historical settlement realization
rates. As a result of the new efforts to accelerate cash settlement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized a 44 
average settlement rate of our gross billed charges during this time frame, which were historically recorded in accounts receivable and
revenue at 49 of gross billings. Accordingly, we recorded reductions to net revenue of 1,199,155 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. Additionally, with the reduction in our estimate of our settlement realization rate from 49 to 44 , a 1,650,474 change in
accounting estimate was taken during the third quarter of 2024 in our accounts receivable and revenue. 

We had no investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Our net cash provided by financing activities
was 4,968,250 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 426,671 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of the proceeds of 5,348,871 from line of
credit, offset by the payment of 120,997 to a director, 105,080 paid on convertible notes payable, 100,000 in dividend payments, 50,000
paid on a note payable, and 4,545 in payments on the SBA loan described below. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of proceeds from convertible notes payable of 421,376 and proceeds from line of credit of 35,632,
offset by repayments of line of credit of 28,784. 

54 

Convertible Notes 

As of September 30, 2024, we had convertible debt
outstanding net of amortized debt discount of 105,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 105,080 in principal
payments and paid the total outstanding accrued interest on these notes in the amount of 22,780. We also paid 100,000 of accrued interest
to a convertible noteholder. 

On June 11, 2024, we entered into a settlement
agreement and release of claims with the holder certain notes. Pursuant to the settlement agreement and release of claims, the holder
agreed to cancel such notes in exchange for the fixed amount settlement promissory note in the principal amount of 535,000 described
below. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we exchanged certain notes for the issuance of 938,908 shares of
series Y senior convertible preferred stock to the noteholder. 

On January 24, 2017, we issued a convertible
promissory note in the principal amount of 80,000 for services rendered, which matured on January 24, 2018. This note is currently in
default and accrues interest at a default interest rate of 20 per annum. On March 30, 2023, we executed an additional tranche under this
note in the principal amount of 25,000. This note is currently in default and accrues interest at a default interest rate of 20 per
annum. On August 11, 2023, we executed an additional tranche under this note in the principal amount of 25,000. This note accrues interest
at a rate of 15 per annum. 

Promissory Note Settlement Agreement 

On June 11, 2024, we entered into a settlement
agreement and release of claims with the holder of 165 shares of series R convertible preferred stock and certain convertible promissory
notes. Pursuant to the settlement agreement and release of claims, the holder agreed to cancel its shares of series R convertible preferred
stock and convertible promissory notes in exchange for a new fixed amount settlement promissory note in the principal amount of 535,000.
This transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and a gain on settlement of 78,834 was recorded to the unaudited consolidated
statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in accordance with FASB Topic 470 Borrower s Accounting
for Debt Modifications. 

The note does not bear interest and requires fixed
payments as follows: (i) if we raise at least 5 million but less than 6 million in our planned underwritten public offering, or the
Offering, then we must pay 250,000 on the closing date of the Offering, with payments of 125,000, 125,000 and 35,000 to follow on
the 90 th , 180 th , and 240 th days following the closing of the Offering, respectively; (ii) if we
raise at least 6 million but less than 7 million in the Offering, then we must pay 390,000 on the closing date of the Offering and
 145,000 on the 90 th day following the closing of the Offering; and (iii) if we raise at least 7 million in the Offering,
then we must repay the entire principal amount on the closing date of the Offering. As the Offering was not completed by August 15, 2024,
we are required to pay 25,000 on such date and to continue making payments of 25,000 on each monthly anniversary thereof until the entire
principal amount is repaid in full. If the Offering is completed after August 15, 2024, then we are required to make payments as described
in the schedule above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we abandon the Offering and conduct a new public offering thereafter, then we
are required to make a payment of 100,000 on the closing date of such other public offering, a second payment of 100,000 on the 90 th day
following the closing of such offering and 35,000 each month thereafter until the entire principal amount is repaid in full. If any portion
of the principal amount remains unpaid on the second (2 nd anniversary of the date of the note, it shall become immediately
due and payable on such date. We may prepay the entire principal amount at any time without penalty. The note is unsecured and contains
customary events of default for a loan of this type. Upon an event of default, interest would automatically begin to accrue at a simple
interest rate of ten percent per annum. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid a total of 50,000 against
the outstanding principal due. 

Small Business Administration Loans 

On June 2, 2020, we obtained a loan from the Small
Business Administration of 150,000 at an interest rate of 3.75 with a maturity date of June 2, 2050. The principal balance and accrued
interest at September 30, 2024 was 145,109 and 0, respectively. 

55 

Debenture 

On March 12, 2009, we issued a debenture in the
principal amount of 20,000. The debenture bore interest at 12 per year and matured on September 12, 2009. The balance of the debenture
was 10,989 at September 30, 2024 and the accrued interest was 8,537. We assigned all of our receivables from consumer activations of
the rewards program as collateral on this debenture. 

Line of Credit 

On September 29, 2023, our company and Nova entered
into a two-year revolving purchase and security agreement with DML HC Series, LLC, or DML, to sell, with recourse, Nova s accounts
receivables for a revolving financing up to a maximum advance amount of 4.5 million. A review is performed on a quarterly basis to assess
the adequacy of the maximum amount. If mutually agreed upon by us and DML, the maximum amount may be increased. On April 24, 2024, we
entered into amendment No. 1 with DML which increased the maximum advance amount to 8,000,000 and defined the discount fee equal to 2.25 
per purchase and claims balance forward on new purchases with a minimum fee to now be 10,000. On June 11, 2024, we entered into amendment
No. 2 with DML which further increased the maximum advance amount to 11,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance
of 7,468,971 against the revolving receivable line of credit and accrued interest of 252,628. The revolving purchase and security agreement
includes discounts recorded as interest expense on each funding and matures on September 29, 2025. 

Related Party Loans 

In connection with the acquisition of Edge View
on July 16, 2014, we assumed amounts due to previous owners who are current managers of Edge View. These amounts are due on demand and
do not bear interest. The balance of these amounts is 4,979 as of September 30, 2024. 

Contractual Obligations 

Our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations
under the loans described above. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These
estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

For a description of the accounting policies that,
in management s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could, if
different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the
SEC, on March 27, 2024. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange
Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30,
2024. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer determined that, because
of the material weaknesses described in Item 9A Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023, which we are still in the process of remediating as of September 30, 2024, along with the error identified
in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the three months ended March 31, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. The errors identified in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q were corrected in amended filings.
Investors are directed to Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for the description of
these weaknesses. 

Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

We have evaluated the material weakness described
above and our management and board of directors are committed to the design and successful implementation of internal control over financial
reporting as promptly as possible. We are evaluating our updated internal controls design and will determine whether the controls have
operated effectively during 2024 in order to fully remediate the aforementioned material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting. 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our management has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses, and
in the third quarter of 2024, we continued to implement the following remedial procedures: 

We are making necessary changes by making strategic hiring decisions and providing training to our financial team, and other relevant personnel, on the GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to financial reporting requirements. 

We are implementing proper documentation procedures for key functional areas, control objectives and our workflows. 

We are enhancing our processes, routine and non-routine, to encompass segregation of duties as well as oversight of secondary independent reviews. 

We plan to reinforce effective compensating controls can improve the design of the current process with limited human resources. 

We hired external consultants to assist with our assessment and accounting for variable consideration as accounted for under ASC 606 and our credit loss expense as accounted for under ASC 326. 

57 

We intend to complete the remediation of the material
weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing
an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business
and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately
satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weaknesses
that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we
discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation,
as needed. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Other than in connection with the implementation
of the remedial measures described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the third quarter
of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
