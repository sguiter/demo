 million. On March 15, 2024, the Company refinanced its revolving credit facility (the Refinancing by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security and Guaranty Agreement (the Credit Facility with certain of the Company s subsidiaries and PNC Bank, National Association as lender and as agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company will be provided a revolving line of credit in a principal amount up to million and a single draw term loan (the "Term Loan") in a 

 24 

million. The line of credit and the Term Loan mature in March 2029 . The Credit Facility amends and restates the Company s Existing Credit Facility under that certain Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan, and Security Agreement, dated as of June 20, 2023, by and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, and PNC Bank National Association. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the interest on the amount drawn on the Credit Facility and the outstanding Term Loan balance are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or the bank s base lending rate plus applicable margin (approximately and , respectively, at September 30, 2024 ). As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has drawn million against the line of credit. The Company is subject to various restrictive covenants associated with these borrowings including, but not limited to, a fixed charge ratio and a minimum amount of undrawn availability. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants. Contingent Interest Embedded Derivative Liability Under the Credit Facility Agreement, the interest rate will reset (the "Default Rate") upon the event of a default and an additional will be added to the base rate. The Company analyzed the Default Rate feature of the Credit Facility for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and determined the Default Rate met the definition of a derivative as it is a contingent interest feature. The Company also noted that the Default Rate feature (the 'Default Rate Derivative') required bifurcation from the host contract and was to be accounted for at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815-15, the Company bifurcated the Default Rate feature of the note and determined the derivative is liability classified. The Default Rate Derivative is treated as a liability, initially measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Management has assessed the probability of occurrence for a non-credit default event and determined the likelihood of a referenced event to be remote. Therefore, the estimated fair value of the Default Rate Derivative was negligible as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and therefore no amounts were recorded as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . 

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded income tax expense on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was calculated using a discrete approach. This methodology was used because changes in the Company's results of operations and acquisitions can materially impact the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September, 2024 and 2023 were provisions of and , respectively. Such rates differed from the Federal Statutory rate of primarily due to the state taxes, foreign income taxes on the Company s international operations, and permanent differences. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax benefit or expense that will result from differences between the carrying value of its assets for income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance is recorded to bring the net deferred tax assets to a level that is more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future. This level will be estimated based on a number of factors, especially the amount of net deferred tax assets of the Company that are actually expected to be realized, for tax purposes, in the foreseeable future. There was change to the valuation allowance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company is still evaluating the tax impact of the CTG and SDPI Acquisition, including the impact of the transaction costs. Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate the deferred tax assets and liabilities and corresponding valuation allowance in connection with the CTG Acquisition.

of the shares of outstanding Common Stock as of the closing of the Merger and automatically increases on the first trading day of each calendar year by the number of shares of Common Stock equal to three percent of the total number of outstanding Common Stock on the last day of the prior calendar year. The 2023 Plan allows for awards to be issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants in the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance based awards, other share-based awards, other cash-based awards, or a combination of the foregoing. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. Stock Options In connection with the Merger, all outstanding options to purchase shares of DTIH common stock were canceled and exchanged for options to purchase shares of DTIC Common Stock ("Company Options"). The number of Company Options issued and the associated exercise prices were adjusted using the Common Exchange Ratio used for the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the Company issued options to purchase a total of shares of the Company's Common Stock to former holders of the DTIH stock options. The vesting schedules, remaining term, and provisions (other than the adjusted number of underlying shares and exercise prices) of the Company Options issued, are identical to the vesting schedules, remaining term, and other provisions of the DTIH stock options that were exchanged. Per a post-closing amendment, Company Options currently held by former holders of DTIH stock options are no longer subject to employment considerations. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. Expected volatilities are based on comparable public company data. The Company uses future estimated employee termination and forfeiture rates of the options within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived using the plain vanilla method due to the lack of history and volume of option activity at the Company. The risk-free rate is based on the approximate U.S. Treasury yield rate in effect at the time of grant. The Company s calculation of share price involves the use of different valuation techniques, including a combination of an income and market approach. For any grants of stock options subsequent to the Company being publicly traded, the Company will use the quoted market price as of the grant date as an input into the Black-Scholes model. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , there were shares granted, exercised, or forfeited. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million of stock-based compensation expense within selling, general, and administrative expense on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income related to the accelerated vesting of an executive's performance-based stock options. The performance conditions were satisfied upon completion of the Merger and all performance-based stock options vested on June 20, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million of stock-based compensation expense within other expense on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as a result of the issuance of shares in accordance with the Transaction Service Agreement.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of September 30, 2024, and for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, included elsewhere herein. For additional information pertaining to our business, including risk factors which should be considered before investing in our common stock, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. All dollar amounts are expressed in thousands of United States U.S. dollars ), unless otherwise indicated. Capitalized terms used in this section, but not otherwise defined, have the meanings ascribed to them in the Report. 
 Overview 
 We are a global oilfield services company that designs, engineers, manufactures and provides a differentiated, rental-focused offering of tools for use in onshore and offshore horizontal and directional drilling operations, as well as other cutting-edge solutions across the well life cycle. We now operate from 16 service and support centers across North America and maintains 11 international service and support centers across the Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") regions and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions. 
 Our business model primarily centers on revenue generated from tool rentals and product sales. We generated revenue from total tool rentals and product sales of 40.1 million and 38.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and had net income of 0.9 million and 4.3 million for those same periods. Additionally, we generated revenue from tool rentals and product sales of 114.6 million and 116.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and had net income of 4.4 million and 10.9 million for those same periods, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 12.0 million, and an accumulated deficit of 2.2 million. 
 We believe our future financial performance will be driven by continued investment in oil and gas drilling following years of industry underinvestment. 
 Market Factors 
 Demand for our services and products depends primarily upon the general level of activity in the oil and gas industry, including the number of active drilling rigs, the number of wells drilled, the depth and working pressure of these wells, the number of well completions, the level of well remediation activity, the volume of production and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies. Oil and gas activity is in turn heavily influenced by, among other factors, investor sentiment, availability of capital and oil and gas prices locally and worldwide, which have historically been volatile. 
 Our tool rental revenues are primarily dependent on drilling activity and our ability to gain or maintain market share with a sustainable pricing model. 
 Our product sales revenues are primarily dependent on oil and gas companies paying for tools that are lost or damaged in their drilling programs as well as the customers need to replace aging or consumable products and our ability to provide competitive pricing. 
 All of these factors may be influenced by the oil and gas region in which our customers are operating. While these factors may lead to differing revenues, we have generally been able to forecast our product needs and anticipated revenue levels based on historic trends in a given region and with a specific customer. 
 Recent Developments and Trends 
 Industry Update 
 In the first half of 2024, the oil and gas market witnessed a dynamic interplay of geopolitical tensions, supply concerns, and global demand fluctuations. Crude oil prices remained volatile, with benchmarks such as Brent and WTI experiencing fluctuations driven by a multitude of factors. Geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions, such as the Middle East, continued to influence market sentiment, leading to sporadic spikes in prices. Additionally, concerns over supply disruptions, particularly amidst conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties, added to the market s unease. As the global market for crude oil has continued its recovery, technical recessions, specifically in China, have slowed progress and created fluctuations in global demand. As of September 30, 2024, the WTI oil price was approximately 68.75 per barrel. 
 
 Despite the high volatility in spot oil prices described above, our customers tend to be more focused on medium-term and long term commodity prices when making investment decisions due to the longer lead times for offshore projects. These forward prices 
 33 

experienced far less volatility in 2022 and 2023 and have maintained levels in 2024 which are highly constructive for offshore project demand. 
 
 Prices for natural gas have decreased somewhat throughout the first half of 2024 relative to the fourth quarter of 2023 in the U.S. due to several factors, including a mild winter in key consuming regions and increased production and availability, both of which led to an oversupply in the market. Additionally, constrained storage capacity and delivery delays resulted in uncertainty around liquified natural gas exports in the U.S. 
 
 Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have decreased from an average of 2.64 per one million British Thermal Units MMBtu in September 2023 to 2.28 per MMBtu in September 2024. 
 
 The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the evolving Israel-Hamas conflict have caused uncertainty in the oil and natural gas markets, and the financial markets, both globally and in the U.S. Such uncertainty already has and could continue to cause stock price volatility and supply chain disruptions as well as higher oil and natural gas prices. These could result in higher inflation worldwide, impact consumer spending and negatively impact demand for our goods and services. Moreover, additional interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat inflation could further increase the probability of a recession. 
 
 Notwithstanding the significant commodity price volatility over the past several years, we have seen decreases in drilling activity in the Western Hemisphere. Conversely, Eastern Hemisphere drilling activity has increased year over year. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the monthly average Western Hemisphere rig count was 947 and 946 rigs, respectively, compared to 1,007 and 1,062 rigs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the monthly average Eastern Hemisphere rig count was 736 and 752 rigs, respectively, compared to 739 and 725 rigs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. However, notwithstanding the impact of longer laterals, improved rig efficiencies have partially offset the impact of this reduction. 
 We are experiencing the impacts of global inflation, both in increased personnel costs and the prices of goods and services required to operate our rigs and execute capital projects. While we are currently unable to estimate the ultimate impact of rising prices, we do expect that our costs will continue to rise in the near term and will impact our profitability. 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 
 We use a number of financial and operational measures to routinely analyze and evaluate the performance of our business, including revenue, net and non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. 
 Revenue, net 
 We analyze our performance by comparing actual monthly revenue to revenue trends and revenue forecasts by product line as well as tool activity trends for each month. Our revenue is primarily derived from tool rental and product sales. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We regularly evaluate our financial performance using Adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial performance measure as it excludes non-cash charges and other transactions not related to our core operating activities and allows more meaningful analysis of the trends and performance of our core operations. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we revised our presentation of non-GAAP measures to exclude the presentation of free cash flow in alignment with industry practices and to enhance comparability with our peers. The Company has determined that GAAP disclosures regarding the Company s liquidity and capital resources, in the form provided in the Company s recent periodic reports and without further enhancement through the inclusion of non-GAAP free cash flow information, provide investors with sufficient information on the Company s cash available for investments, acquisitions, and working capital requirements. 
 Please refer to the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable liquidity measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S GAAP.

Key Components of Results of Operations 
 The discussion below relating to significant line items from our interim unaudited consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of the reported amount. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, we have quantified the impact of such items. 
 Revenue, net 
 We currently generate our revenue, net from tool rental services and product sales. Tool rental services consist of rental services, inspection services, and repair services is accounted for in accordance Topic 842. We recognize revenues from renting tools on a straight-line basis. Our rental contract periods are daily, monthly, per well, or based on footage. As part of this straight-line methodology, when the equipment is returned, we recognize as incremental revenue the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay, which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the drilling tool was out on rent, over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date. 
 The rental tool recovery component of product sales revenue is recognized when a tool is deemed to be lost-in-hole, damaged-beyond-repair, or lost-in-transit while in the care, custody, or control of the customer. Other made to order product sales revenue is recognized when the product is made available to the customer for pickup at our shipping dock. 
 We expect our tool rental services revenue to increase over time as a function of an increase in drilling activity, customer pricing, and market share. 
 We expect that product sales revenue will increase as aged and consumable products will continue to be replaced in order to maintain or increase capacity. Additionally, product sale focused acquisitions are expected to further increase product sale revenue. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Our costs and expenses consist of cost of revenue, selling, general, and administrative expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Our cost of revenue consists primarily of all direct and indirect expenses related to providing our tool rental services offering and delivering our product sales, including personnel-related expenses and costs associated with maintaining the facilities. 
 We expect our total cost of tool rental revenue and our total cost of product sale revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, corresponding to our anticipated growth in revenue and employee headcount to support our customers and to maintain the manufacturing, operations and field service team with some expected cost inflation. 
 We expect that gross margins will continue to improve slightly as we leverage our existing cost structure to support an increase in our business activity. In addition, we expect that customer price increases will help offset cost inflation. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for personnel and outside professional services expenses including legal, audit and accounting services, insurance, other administrative expenses and allocated facility costs for our administrative functions. 
 We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as a result of operating as a public company. In particular, we expect our legal, accounting, tax, personnel-related expenses and directors and officers insurance costs reported within general and administrative expense to increase as we establish more comprehensive compliance and governance functions, increased security and IT compliance, review internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and prepare and distribute periodic reports as required by the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our results of operations in future periods. 
 Selling expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for personnel, direct advertising, marketing and promotional material costs, sales commission expense, consulting fees and allocated facility costs for our sales and marketing functions. 
 35 

We intend to increase investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, expand our global customer base, and broaden our brand awareness. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense relates to the consumption of our property and equipment, which consists of rental tools, shop equipment, computer equipment, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements, and the amortization of our intangible assets mainly related to customer relationships, software and partnerships. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Our other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income (expense), gain on sale of property, unrealized gain (loss) on securities, and other miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations.

Tool rental revenue decreased 1.2 million, or (4) , to 28.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 29.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased market activity in relation to our Directional Tool Rentals DTR division, the revenue of which decreased 2.5 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in our Premium Tools Division ("PTD"), the revenue of which increased 0.4 million and an increase at our Wellbore Optizimation Tools ("WOT") division, revenue of which increased 0.6 million.

Product sale revenue increased 3.2 million, or 36 , to 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase by additional product sales as it relates to Deep Casing ("DCT") which was acquired in March 2024 and the Diamond Products Division ("DPD"), which was acquired in August 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower tool recovery revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 We use the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding interest income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA. 
 39 

This non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of this non-GAAP financial measures compared to the closest comparable U.S.GAAP measure. Some of these limitations are that: 
 Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges such as depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of acquired intangible assets and, although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; 

Adjusted EBITDA excludes income tax benefit (expense). 

The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (non-recurring transaction expenses recorded to other (income) expense are presented separately within Adjusted EBITDA):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 12.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash on hand, cash flows generated by operating activities and, if necessary, borrowings under the Credit Facility Agreement. We may use additional cash generated to execute strategic acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. We believe that our existing cash on hand, cash generated from operations and available borrowings under the Credit Facility Agreement will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures. 
 Credit Facility Agreement 
 Reference is made to the disclosure set forth under the heading Revolving Credit Facility in Note 7 Revolving Credit Facility , of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report (the Interim Financial Statements). 
 40 

Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditure relates to capital additions or improvements that add to our rental or repair capacity or extend the useful life of our drilling tools and related infrastructure. Also, our capital expenditures replace tools that are lost or damaged by a customer and these are funded by a rental tool recovery sale amount from the customer. We regularly incur capital expenditures on an on-going basis in order to (i) increase or maintain our rental tool fleet and equipment, (ii) extend the useful life of our rental tools and equipment and (iii) acquire or upgrade computer hardware and software. The amount of our capital expenditures is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services, recovery of lost or damaged tools, schedules for refurbishing our various rental tools and equipment, cash flow generated by our operations, expected rates of return and cash required for other purposes. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our material contractual obligations arise from leases of facilities and vehicles under noncancelable operating leases agreements. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the Interim Financial Statements. 
 Tax Obligations 
 We currently have available federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset our federal taxable income, and we expect that these carryforwards will substantially reduce our cash tax payments over the next several years. If we forfeit these carryforwards for any reason or deplete them faster than anticipated, our cash tax obligations could increase substantially. For additional information, see Note 8, Income Taxes, of the notes to the Interim Financial Statements.

Cash Flows (Used In) Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.7 million resulting from our net income of 4.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 21.1 million in depreciation and amortization, including non-cash lease expense and deferred financing costs, 1.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, and 0.3 million in provisions for excess and obsolete property, plant, and equipment and credit losses. This was partially offset by a 7.3 million gain on rental tool recovery sales, 1.3 million in deferred tax expense, and 8.6 million in net changes from operating assets and liabilities. The 8.6 million in cash used in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a 0.6 million cash outflow in prepaid expenses due to the timing of payments, a 2.9 million cash outflow in inventory, 3.4 million cash outflow in operating lease liabilities, and a 3.7 million cash outflow related to accounts payable and accrued expenses. These outflows were offset by a 2.1 million cash inflow related to accounts receivables. We will continue to evaluate our capital requirements for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs, which could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the current inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and other risks detailed in the section of this Report entitled Risk Factors. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 17.5 million resulting from our net income of 10.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 18.5 million in depreciation and amortization, including amortization of right of use assets and deferred financing costs, 4.0 million of stock-based compensation expense as a result of the Merger, 0.5 million of bad debt expense and 3.7 million in deferred tax expense. This was partially offset by a 14.0 million gain on rental tool recovery sales and 6.7 million in net changes from operating assets and liabilities. The 6.7million in cash used in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a 0.5 million cash outflow in accounts receivable associated with an increase in sales and higher revenues during the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022, a 3.3 million cash outflow from operating lease liabilities as we increase right-of-use assets on hand and a 2.9 million cash outflow from inventories due to purchased inventory related to our attempt to reduce risk and uncertainties in our supply chain. This was partially offset by a 0.1 million cash inflow in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to differences in the timing of disbursements. We will continue to evaluate our capital requirements for both 
 41 

short-term and long-term liquidity needs, which could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the current inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and other risks detailed in the section of this Report entitled Risk Factors. 
 Cash Flows (Used In) Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 46.1 million. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment of 19.6 million and business acquisitions of 38.6 million were partially offset by proceeds from rental tool recovery sales of 10.9 million and proceeds from the sale of equity securities of 1.2 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 20.0 million. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment of 36.7 million were partially offset by proceeds from rental tool recovery sales of 16.6 million and proceeds from sale of property of 0.1 million. 
 Cash Flows (Used In) Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 43.4 million resulting from proceeds from the term loan of 25 million and proceeds from the revolving line of credit of 30.1 million offset by 0.7 million in payments of deferred financing costs and 10.9 million in repayments of the Term Loan and the revolving line of credit. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 4.3 million resulting from proceeds from the Merger and PIPE Financing, net of transaction costs, of 23.1 million, partially offset by a net decrease in amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility Agreement of 18.3 million, payments of deferred financing costs of 0.3 million and payments to holders of DTIH convertible preferred stock in connection with the Merger of 0.2 million. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The Interim Financial Statements included in this Report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these Interim Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We also make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures for the periods presented. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in assumptions, estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or other causes could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report"). In addition to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report, accounting for Business Combinations was identified as a new critical accounting policy and estimate in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. On the acquisition date for a business combination, we allocate the total purchase consideration for the acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Additionally, we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to acquired intangible assets. We identify an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separately sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. We recognize goodwill, if any, in the amount by which the aggregate fair value of the total purchase consideration exceeds the aggregate fair value of the net assets (including intangible assets) acquired. 
 
 In determining the fair values of assets acquired (including intangible assets) and liabilities assumed, we utilize a variety of methods. Each asset acquired and liability assumed is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The methods used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporate significant estimates and assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including, but not limited to, a market participant s use of the asset as well as forecasts for cash flows, revenue growth, asset lives, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, income tax rates, and discount rates. 
 
 We believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that a market participant would use. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
 42 

at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The use of different assumptions related to these uncertain factors at acquisition could result in material changes to the amounts initially recorded at acquisition, which could have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. When appropriate, we engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 
 If the initial accounting for a business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. We must complete the accounting for each business combination during its measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. Adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Costs that are directly attributable to business combinations are expensed as incurred within other expenses, net, on the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The results of operations of acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards 
 A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. DTI will take advantage of these exemptions until such earlier time that it is no longer an emerging growth company. DTI would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of this offering (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which its total annual gross revenue is equal to or more than 1.07 billion (iii) the date on which it has issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (iv) the date on which it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Credit risk 
 Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with major and reputable financial institutions. Deposits held with the financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on such deposits but may be redeemed upon demand. We perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions. With respect to accounts receivable, we monitor the credit quality of our customers as well as maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. 
 Concentration risk 
 
 A discussion of concentration risk is included in 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 Foreign currency risk 
 Our customers are primarily located in the United States and Canada. Therefore, foreign exchange risk exposures arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which is our functional and reporting currency. To date, a majority of our sales have been denominated in United States and Canadian dollars. As we expand our presence in international markets, our results of operations and cash flows may increasingly be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements 
 43 

to minimize the impact of these fluctuations in the exchange rates. We will periodically reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. 
 We do not believe that foreign currency risk had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during the periods presented. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We expect we will continue to experience inflationary pressures on our cost structure for the foreseeable future. However, tightness in overseas freight and transit times have eased. Additionally, raw material and component costs are moderating due in part to a strengthening U.S. dollar and weakening steel demand. Nonetheless, we cannot be confident that transit times or input prices will return to the lower levels experienced in prior years. Continued inflation and looming concerns regarding a possible recession weigh on the outlook for oil demand which could in turn negatively impact demand for our goods and services. 
 Cybersecurity Risk 
 We have a suite of controls including technology hardware and software solutions, regular testing of the resiliency of our systems including penetration and disaster recovery testing as well as regular training sessions on cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies. We have established an incident response plan and team to take steps it determines are appropriate to contain, mitigate and remediate a cybersecurity incident and to respond to the associated business, legal and reputational risks. There is no assurance that these efforts will fully mitigate cybersecurity risk and mitigation efforts are not an assurance that no cybersecurity incidents will occur. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of June 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. As a result of management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2024, or as of the date of the filing of this Report. 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, or as of the date of filing of this Report, because all findings in connection with our preparation and the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 have not been fully remediated despite ongoing projects and improvements made in the current quarter. As a result, we were not able to rely upon the disclosure controls and procedures that were in place as of September 30, 2024, or as of the date of this filing, and we continue to have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness is described in more detail below. 
 
 Prior to the Merger, we had been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with our preparation and the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified the following deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal controls to be a material weakness: 
 
 (1) Failure to promote effective internal control over financial reporting throughout the Company s management structure; 

(2) Failure to develop effective risk assessment controls to identify financial reporting risks and reacting to changes in the operating environment that could have a material effect on financial reporting; 

(3) Ineffective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting; and 

44 

(4) Inadequate documentation and monitoring of information technology IT general controls and cybersecurity processes within the Company s IT environment, including access controls and segregation of duties between key IT functions. 

We are in the process of implementing a risk assessment process and measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness, including (1) hiring more qualified staff and increasing resources with sufficient knowledge and experience to strengthen financial reporting, (2) implementing software and procedures to enhance our Company s IT environment and (3) devoting proper time by senior management to perform comprehensive review of procedures to assess risks and enforce effective accountability. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
