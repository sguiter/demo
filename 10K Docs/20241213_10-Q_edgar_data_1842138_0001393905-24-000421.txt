 , as of October 31, 2024 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In order to remain in business, the Company will need to raise capital in the next twelve months. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and proceeds from its public offering. The Company has no written or verbal commitments from stockholders, director or officer to provide the Company with any form of cash advances, loans or other sources of liquidity to meet its working capital needs. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 
 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results are likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in this section. 
 
 Background 
 
 We were incorporated on November 18, 2020 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. 
 
 We were involved in the development of a ride-hailing and food delivery computer and mobile device application known as WarpSpeedTaxi . 
 
 On September 6, 2022, we entered into a debt settlement agreement with Global Corporate Structural Services Inc. GCSS ), a private company that has provided us with marketing, beta testing, cloning, and maintenance services in connection with the WarpSpeed Taxi computer application. Pursuant to the debt settlement agreement, we acknowledged that we owed 135,430.95 to GCSS for its services as of July 31, 2024. 
 
 On September 15, 2022, we entered into a final settlement agreement with GCSS whereby we have agreed to transfer our 100 interest in the WarpSpeed Taxi application to GCSS in full and final satisfaction of the debt owed to GCSS and any other claims that GCSS has against us. However, we will retain a license for the sole and exclusive use of the WarpSpeed Taxi application in the United States. 
 
 We anticipate that our WarpSpeedTaxi application will allow customers to hire a standard and luxury motor vehicles via a smartphone or personal computer for both one-way and round-trips with the price based on the distance travelled and the current level of demand for vehicles. In addition to transporting passengers, the application may also be used for deliveries of goods from restaurants, grocery stores, and other businesses that typically utilize local vehicle courier services. 
 
 Customers will use the application to request a ride or the delivery of goods. Drivers that we recruit and approve, through confirmation of no criminal record, a clean driving history, and access to a suitable insured vehicle, will act as independent contractors and set their own work hours. They will connect with customers via our application, pick up customers or goods to be delivered in accordance with the customer s request, and then drive the customers or goods to their destination. Customers will pay for the transportation through the application by way of credit card. Drivers will receive payments for each ride or delivery they complete via a weekly direct deposit to their bank accounts. 
 
 When a customer uses the WarpSpeedTaxi application for ride-hailing, we will charge the customer a flat fee of approximately 2.00 for each ride plus an amount for each mile that the customer travels. The amount for each mile will vary depending on the city in which the customer is located. It will be higher in more densely populated cities where traffic moves relatively slowly and lower in less densely population cities will less traffic congestion. Additionally, we will charge customers an additional premium during busy times when customer demand exceeds the number of available drivers. This increase in pricing is intended to incentivize drivers to work during peak demand times since they will receive greater compensation. In order to encourage drivers to work a independent contractors for us, we will initially retain 15 of all revenue that a customer pays for a ride with the remaining 85 compensating the driver for his or her time and vehicle expenses. Drivers will also retain 100 of all tips that customers provide them. Over time, when we have established a market for our services, we may adjust this percentage so that we retain a greater percentage of revenue. 
 
 When a restaurant uses the food delivery service feature of our WarpSpeedTaxi application, we will charge restaurants between 5 and 15 of their order revenue, subject to a set minimum amount, depending on the amount of business that we receive from delivery orders of their food through our application. From these proceeds, we will pay our drivers a base fee for deliveries that depend on the distance that they must travel to pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. In addition, the driver will retain any tips that the customer provides. 
 10 
 
 PinnacleDSB 
 
 In January 2023, we announced our intention to pursue the PinnacleDSB project, which would involve the development of t commercial software that we would employ to establish large distribution centers in major cities that are surrounded by towns and villages in rural areas around the world. A large percentage of the world population lives in rural areas in non-Western countries where most consumers purchase goods through local shops. Local shop owners have traditionally purchased their inventory from wholesalers located in nearby major cities. Using PinnacleDSB s automated inventory and product delivery system, our intention is to provide rural businesses with an alternative means of accessing consumer goods that will be more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective than existence supply chain options. We would provide local shop owners with a secure tablet in order to access real-time inventory data that would enable them to place purchase orders at competitive prices. Our intention is to implement logistics for a weekly delivery system to local shops. 
 
 To date, we have prepared and disseminated a business plan relating to the PinnacleDSB project, but we have not secured the financing necessary to proceed it. We intend to proceed with the business once we have secured financing of approximately 1,000,000. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funding necessary to pursue and complete this project. 
 
 NextFind AI 
 
 On June 18, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Arcgen Consultants, a partnership formed pursuant to the laws of India operating under the name NextFind AI NextFind AI ), to establish a joint venture that will focus on the marketing and development of various artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. 
 
 This agreement has been terminated. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Three months Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Our net loss for the three-month period ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was 12,070 and 5,232, respectively, which consisted entirely of general and administrative fees. We did not generate any revenue to date. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 As at October 31, 2024, our current assets were 15,019, compared to 15,039 at July 31, 2024. The decrease in current assets in the current fiscal year is due to use of our cash for ordinary business expenses and reduction in accounts payable owed to vendors. 
 
 As at October 31, 2024, our current liabilities were 100,064, compared to 81,265 at July 31, 2024. Current liabilities at October 31, 2024 were comprised entirely of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Current liabilities decreased in the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal as compared to the July 31, 2024 year end due to a reduction in accounts payable from a cancellation of an agreement with a vendor relating to software development. 
 
 We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other methods, the sale of equity or debt securities. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 For the three-month period ended October 31, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities were 6,730, consisting of a net loss of 12,070, which was offset by 18,799 increase of accounts payable. This compares to net cash flows provided from operating activities of 6,740 consisting of a net loss of 5,232 offset by accounts payable of 11,972 for the three-month period ended October 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 For the three-month period ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash flows provided from investing activities were 6,750 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 6,750, respectively, which consisted of software development. 
 11 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 We have financed our operations from the issuance of our shares of common stock. Net cash flows generated from financing activities were 0 in the three-month period ended October 31, 2024 as compared to 0 during the three-month period ended October 31, 2023. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 GOING CONCERN 
 
 The independent auditors report accompanying our July 31, 2024 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 As supervised by our board of directors and our principal executive and principal financial officer, management has established a system of disclosure, controls and procedures and has evaluated the effectiveness of that system. The system and its evaluation are reported on in the below Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our principal executive and financial officer has concluded that our disclosure, controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of October 31, 2024, were not effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024. We carried out this assessment using the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm, pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Management concluded in this assessment that as of October 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 
 
 There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the first quarter of our 2025 fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
