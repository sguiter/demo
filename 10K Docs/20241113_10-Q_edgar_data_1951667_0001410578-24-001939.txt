 reporting unit. The Company measures goodwill impairment, if any, as the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The review of goodwill impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in the Company s stock price and market capitalization of the Company and macroeconomic conditions. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). The Company uses the income approach and/or a market-based approach to determine the reporting units fair values, which are based on discounted cash flows. The determination of discounted cash flows of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.

 business segments: parallel-import vehicle dealership and logistics and warehousing services. Revenue from the parallel-import vehicle dealership business is generated from the sales of parallel-import vehicles to both domestic and overseas parallel-import car dealers. It purchases automobiles from the U.S. market through its team of professional purchasing agents, and mainly resells them to parallel-import car dealers in the U.S. and the PRC. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the vehicles has been transferred to the dealers. For sales to U.S. domestic parallel-import car dealers, revenue is recognized when a vehicle is delivered, and its title has been transferred to the dealers. For overseas sales, the Company sells vehicles under Cost and Freight CFR shipping point terms, and revenue is recognized when a vehicle is loaded on a cargo ship and its title has been transferred to the dealers. The Company accounts for the revenue generated from sales of vehicles on a gross basis as the Company is acting as a principal in these transactions, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, and is responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide customers the specified goods, which the Company has control of the goods and has the ability to direct the use of goods to obtain substantially all the benefits. All of the Company s contracts have one single performance obligation as the promise is to transfer the individual vehicle to parallel-import vehicle dealers, and there is no separately identifiable other promise in the contracts. The Company s vehicles are sold with no right of return and the Company does not provide other credits or sales incentives to parallel-import car dealers. Historically, no customer returns have occurred. Therefore, the Company did not provide any sales return allowances for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In the logistics and warehousing services segment, revenue from freight forwarding services, both export and import, is recognized when the services are provided, based on the relative transit time. The Company s role as the principal in these services involves managing the entire shipping process from origin to destination, allowing revenue recognition on a gross basis throughout the transit period. For warehousing services, revenue is primarily derived from storage fees, which are recognized based on the actual number of days the goods are stored in the warehouse while awaiting further transportation. Across all operations, the Company maintains a principal position, controlling the goods and services, bearing inventory and pricing risks, and fulfilling performance obligations directly. Each contract is typically structured with a single performance obligation without allowances for returns or sales incentives, ensuring straightforward revenue recognition with no provisions for sales return allowances based on historical experiences of no returns. Contract balances and remaining performance obligations The Company did not have any contract assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.

Business Overview and Recent Developing Trends We are a provider of logistics and warehousing services, historically in connection with the sale of parallel-import vehicles sourced in the U.S. to be sold in the PRC market, and more recently for the transportation of other goods between the U.S. and the PRC. We began our operations in 2016 exclusively as a parallel-import vehicle dealer for luxury brand automobiles but have now focused on facilitating non-vehicle trade in view of the continued weakness for imported automobiles in the PRC. Sales of parallel-import vehicle to the PRC market represented a significant part of our revenue before 2024. From 2016 to the first half of 2022, we experienced significant growth in sales volume, revenue, and gross profit of parallel-import vehicles due to our core strengths and a favorable economic climate. However, since the second half of 2022, our parallel-import vehicle business has been impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdowns in the PRC, and the weaker customer demand in the PRC caused by the deteriorated macroeconomic conditions. The parallel-vehicle import market has continued to be significantly affected by the adverse market conditions resulting from significant price discounting by luxury import brands and a shift in consumer interest to domestic electric vehicles EVs ). In 2023, we had a decrease in parallel-import vehicle sales by 30.5 , and net income by 87.5 compared to 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our parallel-import vehicle business sales decreased by 95.0 compared to the same period of 2023. In February 2024, we acquired Edward Transit Express Group Inc. Edward to expand our logistics and warehousing service operations. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we increased our marketing staff to pursue new business opportunities and focus on international trade flows between the PRC and U.S. Additionally, in July 2024, we relocated our headquarters from Charlotte, NC, to Irvine, CA, which we believe will enable a stronger management focus on our logistics and warehousing business due to Irvine s proximity to the important ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of approximately 0.2 million from logistics and warehousing services. While we believe that tangible results of these efforts may not be apparent for several quarters, we have confidence that we are positioning the Company for substantial future growth in this business.

 Results of Operations Revenues The Company operates in two business segments: parallel-import vehicle sales and logistics and warehousing services. Revenue from the parallel-import vehicle dealership business is generated from the sale of parallel-import vehicles to both domestic and overseas parallel-import car dealers. We purchase automobiles from the U.S. market through our team of professional purchasing agents and resell them mainly to parallel-import car dealers in the U.S. and the PRC. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the vehicles has been transferred to the dealers. For sales to U.S. domestic parallel-import car dealers, revenue is recognized when a vehicle is delivered, and its title has been transferred to the dealers. For overseas sales, the Company sells vehicles under CFR shipping terms, and revenue is recognized when a vehicle is loaded on a cargo ship and its title has been transferred to the dealers. We account for the revenue generated from sales of vehicles on a gross basis as we are acting as a principal in these transactions, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices, and are responsible for fulfilling customer orders. As stated above, the parallel-import vehicle business has continued to decline since 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales in the parallel-import vehicle business decreased by 95.0 compared to the same period in 2023, with no revenue generated during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has been transforming its business from parallel-import vehicles to logistics and warehousing services since the acquisition of Edward. In the logistics and warehousing services segment, revenue from freight forwarding services, both export and import, is recognized when the services are provided, based on the relative transit time. Our role as the principal in these services involves managing the entire shipping process from origin to destination, allowing revenue recognition on a gross basis throughout the transit period. For warehousing services, revenue is primarily derived from storage fees, which are recognized based on the actual number of days the goods are stored in the warehouse while awaiting further transportation. Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenue from parallel-import vehicles sold mainly comprises (i) the purchase cost of vehicles, including dealership service fees and non-refundable taxes incurred during procurement, and (ii) fulfillment expenses, mainly including (a) compensation and bonuses for staff in the purchasing department, (b) commission paid to purchasing agents, (c) transportation and storage costs for vehicles, and (d) consulting fees paid to dealer experts to assist us in making the best purchase decisions. Allowance for slow-moving inventories is also included in the cost of revenue when our cost of inventory is higher than net realizable value. In line with the revenue decline in the parallel-import vehicle business since 2023, we recorded a 94.4 decrease in cost of revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, there was no cost of revenues recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our cost of revenue from logistics and warehousing service mainly includes the associated costs of freight and fulfillment expenses. We act as a principal, controlling the goods and services, bearing inventory and pricing risks, and fulfill performance obligations directly. Interest Expenses The Company obtained loans from finance companies through (i) LC financing by using letters of credit from our international customers in overseas sales of parallel-import vehicles as collateral, and (ii) accessing revolving lines of credit to further support our operations and strategic initiatives. Risks and Uncertainties Our operations are in the U.S. and our primary market is in the PRC. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be influenced by political, economic, and legal environments in the U.S. and the PRC, as well as by the general state of the U.S. and the PRC economies. Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the political, regulatory, and social conditions in the U.S. and the PRC.

 Risks and uncertainties related to our business include, but are not limited to, the following: Changes in consumer demand in the Chinese market towards fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs, or a general declining purchasing power of PRC consumers, may adversely affect our vehicle sales volumes and results of operations; 
 The PRC government policies on the purchase and ownership of automobiles and stricter emissions standards may reduce the market demand for the automobiles we sell and thus negatively affect our business and growth prospects; 
 Any adverse change in political relations between the PRC and the U.S. or any other country where those brands originate, including the ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and the PRC, may negatively affect our business; Our business and financial condition may be substantially harmed by inventory losses caused by theft, vandalism, or accidents during transportation and/or warehousing; The ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and several of its regional adversaries could materially and adversely affect the global economy and capital markets, including significant volatility in commodity prices, especially energy prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions; and Inflation in the economy may result in higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, and increased costs of labor, and may adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers.

We believe that we will be able to fund current operations and other commitments for at least the next 12 months from operating cash flow and proceeds from the capital infusion which were held in our cash and cash equivalents. Additional sources of cash may be needed due to unanticipated changes in business conditions or other future developments. If additional resources are required, we may sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could include operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:
