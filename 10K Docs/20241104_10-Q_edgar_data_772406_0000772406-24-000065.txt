As of September 28, 2024, remaining restructuring-related liabilities were immaterial and are expected to be substantially paid out in cash during fiscal year 2025.

 Provision for income taxes Effective tax rate 
 
 Our income tax expense was million and million for the second quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of percent and percent, respectively. Our income tax expense was million and million for the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of percent and percent, respectively. 
 
 Effective tax rates for all periods presented were unfavorably impacted by a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that requires research and development ("R D") expenditures incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 to be capitalized and amortized ratably over five or fifteen years depending on the location in which the research activities are conducted, resulting in higher global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"), which is treated as a period cost. In addition, our effective tax rates for all periods presented were unfavorably impacted by U.S. tax rules related to refundable tax credits, including R D expenditure credits available to us in the United Kingdom, that reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to offset GILTI. Our effective tax rates for the periods presented were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to these two items, partially offset by the effect of income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions that is taxed below the federal statutory rate. 
 
 The Company records unrecognized tax benefits for the estimated risk associated with tax positions taken on tax returns. At September 28, 2024, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of million, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company s total unrecognized tax benefits are classified as Non-current income taxes" in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As of September 28, 2024, the balance of accrued interest and penalties, net of tax, was million. 
 
 On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. et al. v. Commissioner which concluded that the regulations relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in intercompany cost-sharing arrangements were invalid. In 2016 the U.S. Internal Revenue Service appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Ninth Circuit ). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the U.S. Tax Court and upheld the cost-sharing regulations. On February 10, 2020, Altera Corp. filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, which was denied by the Supreme Court on June 22, 2020. Although the issue is now resolved in the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit's opinion is not binding in other circuits. The potential impact of this issue on the Company, which is not located within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, is unclear at this time. We will continue to monitor developments related to this issue and the potential impact of those developments on the Company's current and prior fiscal years. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. Fiscal years 2017 through 2019 and 2021 through 2024 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

million, excluding interest, and imposed penalties of approximately million. The Company does not agree with the IRS's positions and has not accrued an additional liability. In July 2024, the Company entered the administrative dispute process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals ("IRS Appeals"). We intend to vigorously dispute the proposed adjustments and pursue judicial remedies if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals. The Company expects it could take a number of years to reach resolution on these matters. Although the final resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company believes adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes that may ultimately result. However, if the IRS prevails in these matters, the ultimate amount of assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could be material and may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in future periods. The Company is not under an income tax audit in any other major taxing jurisdiction.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts. We evaluate the estimates on an ongoing basis. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

Additionally, the second quarter of fiscal 2025 began and ended one week later than the comparable quarter in the prior year. Thus, it encompassed one week more of the higher-volume production associated with typical seasonal product ramps. 
 
 Net sales for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 increased 117.8 million, or 15 percent, to 915.9 million from 798.1 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2024. Net sales from our audio products increased 56.9 million, primarily driven by higher smartphone unit volumes and sales associated with next-generation products, partially offset by lower general market sales. Net sales from HPMS products increased 60.9 million for the year versus the first six months of fiscal year 2024, primarily due to higher smartphone unit volumes and sales associated with next-generation products, partially offset by lower general market sales. 
 
 International sales, including sales to U.S.-based end customers that manufacture products through contract manufacturers or plants located overseas, were approximately 100 percent and 99 percent of net sales for the second quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 99 percent for each of the first six month periods of fiscal years 2025 and 2024. Our sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. 
 17 

Since the components we produce are largely proprietary, we consider our end customer to be the entity specifying the use of our component in their design. These end customers may purchase our products directly from us, through distributors, or third-party manufacturers contracted to produce their designs. For the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, our ten largest end customers represented approximately 97 percent and 95 percent, respectively, of our net sales, and 96 percent and 94 percent of our net sales for the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. 
 
 We had one end customer, Apple Inc., that purchased through multiple contract manufacturers and represented approximately 90 percent and 88 percent of the Company s total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 89 percent and 86 percent for the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. 
 
 No other end customer or distributor represented more than 10 percent of net sales for the three and six months ended September 28, 2024 or September 23, 2023. 
 
 For more information, please see "Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors" We depend on a limited number of customers and distributors for a substantial portion of our sales, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, or pricing on products sold to, any key customer or distributor could significantly reduce our sales and our profitability. 
 
 Gross Margin 
 
 Gross margin was 52.2 percent in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, up from 51.3 percent in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, largely due to a favorable product mix, offset in part by higher supply chain costs versus the prior period. 
 
 Gross margin was 51.5 percent for the first six months of fiscal year 2025, up from 50.9 percent for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 due to a more favorable product mix, and, to a lesser extent, reduced freight costs, partially offset by higher inventory reserves, as well as costs associated with new product ramps. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 
 Research and development expense for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 112.9 million, an increase of 8.7 million, from 104.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Significant drivers of the increase included increased variable compensation, employee-related, facilities-related and product development costs, offset by reduced acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter. 
 
 Research and development expense for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was 218.3 million, an increase of 7.9 million, from 210.4 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 primarily due to increased variable compensation, facilities-related and employee-related costs, partially offset by reduced acquisition-related costs and an investment write-off that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 37.8 million, an increase of 3.5 million, from 34.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, due to increased employee-related and variable compensation expenses. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was 74.6 million, an increase of 4.9 million, from 69.7 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2024, primarily due to increased variable compensation costs, employee-related expenses, and lease impairment costs for the period. 
 
 Restructuring 
 
 In fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded costs related to a workforce reduction action taken in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Restructuring costs for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2024 were 2.3 million. See Note 10 - Restructuring Costs for additional information. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 The Company reported interest income of 8.4 million and 16.8 million for the three and six months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and 4.0 million and 8.8 million for the three and six months ended September 23, 2023, 
 18 

respectively. Interest income increased in the current period due to higher yields on higher combined average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, compared to the prior period. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 The Company reported interest expense of 0.2 million and 0.5 million for the three and six months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and 0.2 million and 0.5 million for the three and six months ended September 23, 2023, respectively. Interest expense consists primarily of commitment fees associated with the Company's Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 8 - Revolving Credit Facility of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements). 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 For the three and six months ended September 28, 2024, the Company reported other income of an immaterial amount and 1.6 million, respectively, and 0.1 million of other expense and 0.3 million of other income for the three and six months ended September 23, 2023, respectively. This activity primarily related to non-investment related income and remeasurement on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our provision for income taxes is based on estimated effective tax rates derived from an estimate of annual consolidated earnings before taxes, adjusted for nondeductible expenses, other permanent items and any applicable credits. 
 
 The following table presents the provision for income taxes (in thousands) and the effective tax rates: 
 
 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended September 28, September 23, September 28, September 23, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income before income taxes 140,005 109,408 196,608 132,178 Provision for income taxes 37,865 34,001 52,373 41,171 Effective tax rate 27.0 31.1 26.6 31.1 
 
 Our income tax expense for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 37.9 million compared to 34.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, resulting in effective tax rates of 27.0 percent and 31.1 percent, respectively. Our income tax expense was 52.4 million and 41.2 million for the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 26.6 percent and 31.1 percent, respectively. Effective tax rates for all periods presented were unfavorably impacted by a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that requires R D expenditures incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 to be capitalized and amortized ratably over five or fifteen years depending on the location in which the research activities are conducted, resulting in higher GILTI, which is treated as a period cost. In addition, our effective tax rates for all periods presented were unfavorably impacted by U.S. tax rules related to refundable tax credits, including R D expenditure credits available to us in the United Kingdom, that reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to offset GILTI. Our effective tax rates for the periods presented were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to these two items, partially offset by the effect of income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions that is taxed below the federal statutory rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for inventory, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and strategic acquisitions. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, cash generated from the sale and maturity of marketable securities, and available borrowings under our 300 million Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Cash used in or generated from our operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in working capital. Cash generated from operations was 95.4 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 versus 62.5 million used during the corresponding period of fiscal year 2024. The cash flow from operations during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was related to the cash components of our net income and a 117.9 million unfavorable change in working capital, primarily as a result of increases in accounts receivables and inventory, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, prepaid wafer usage (related to the Capacity Reservation Agreement), and income taxes payable. The cash flow used in operations during the corresponding period of fiscal year 2024 was related to the cash components of our 
 19 

net income and a 216.5 million unfavorable change in working capital, primarily as a result of an increase in accounts receivables and inventory and a decrease in acquisition-related liabilities, partially offset by prepaid wafer usage (related to the Capacity Reservation Agreement) beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 72.0 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 versus 23.8 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2024. The cash used in investing activities in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was related to capital expenditures of 12.9 million and net purchases of marketable securities of 59.2 million. The cash used in investing activities in the corresponding period in fiscal year 2024 was related to capital expenditures and technology investments of 20.8 million and net purchases of marketable securities of 2.9 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 80.4 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and was primarily associated with stock repurchases for the period of 91.0 million, partially offset by 10.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily related to stock option exercises. The cash used in financing activities during the first six months of fiscal year 2024 of 81.6 million was primarily associated with stock repurchases during the period of 79.1 million. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, the timing and extent of research and development projects, potential future acquisitions of companies or technologies, inventory build, and commitments under the Capacity Reservation Agreement with GlobalFoundries (discussed further in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements). We believe our expected future cash earnings, existing cash, cash equivalents, investment balances, and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements both domestically and internationally, in the short-term (i.e. the next 12 months) and in the long-term, although we could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding prior to that time. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On July 8, 2021, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Second Amended Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a 300 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 8, 2026 (the Maturity Date ). The Revolving Credit Facility is required to be guaranteed by all of Cirrus Logic s material domestic subsidiaries ("Subsidiary Guarantors"). The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all the assets of Cirrus Logic and any Subsidiary Guarantors, except for certain excluded assets. 
 
 On March 20, 2023, the Company, entered into the First Amendment (the "Amendment") to its Second Amended Credit Agreement, with the lending institutions party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Amendment updates the benchmark interest rate provisions to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR, for the purposes of calculating interest under the terms of the Second Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and was in compliance with all covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 See Note 8 Revolving Credit Facility for additional information including material terms and related covenants. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt securities, currency movements on non-functional currency assets and liabilities, and the effect of market factors on the value of our marketable securities. We assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies that are designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures. We use forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange risk attributable to certain non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in earnings along with the gains and losses resulting from remeasuring the underlying exposures. Information about our market risks as of September 28, 2024, does not materially differ from the description of our market risks included in " Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk within our fiscal year 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on May 24, 2024. For related financial statement impact see Note 5 - Derivative Financial Instruments.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer (CEO) and interim chief financial officer (CFO), the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based upon the evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 Changes in control over financial reporting 
 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 28, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Information regarding legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is set forth in Note 14 Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In evaluating all forward-looking statements, you should specifically consider risk factors that may cause actual results to vary from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Various risk factors associated with our business are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 30, 2024, as filed with the Commission on May 24, 2024, and available at www.sec.gov. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to those risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024. 
 
 We depend on a limited number of customers and distributors for a substantial portion of our sales, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, or pricing on products sold to, any key customer or distributor could significantly reduce our sales and our profitability. 
 
 While we generate sales from a broad base of customers worldwide, the loss of any of our key customers, or a significant reduction in sales or selling prices to any key customer, or reductions in selling prices made to retain key customer relationships, would significantly reduce our revenue, margins and earnings and adversely affect our business. For the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, our ten largest end customers represented approximately 97 percent and 95 percent of our net sales, respectively. For the first six months of fiscal years of 2025 and 2024, our ten largest end customers represented approximately 96 percent and 94 percent of our net sales, respectively. We had one end customer, Apple Inc., that purchased through multiple contract manufacturers and represented approximately 90 percent and 88 percent of the Company s total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 89 percent and 86 percent for the first six months of fiscal years of 2025 and 2024, respectively. No other end customer or distributor represented more than 10 percent of net sales for the three and six months ended September 28, 2024, or September 23, 2023. 
 
 We may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons, including: - most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty; 
 21 

- our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products; - many of our customers have pre-existing or concurrent relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect the customers decisions to purchase our products; - many of our customers have sufficient resources to internally develop technology solutions and semiconductor components that could replace the products that we currently supply in our customers end products; - our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products; - our customers may be subject to investigations and litigation that could result in injunctive or other relief that negatively impacts sales of their products, which in turn would result in a decrease in demand for our products; - our customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which increases their negotiating leverage with us and their ability to either obtain or dual-source components from other suppliers; and - our current customers may be hesitant in some cases to award new business to us based on their desire to manage their supply chain risks around any potential over-dependence on a supplier or supply chain. In addition, our dependence on a limited number of key customers may make it easier for them to demand favorable commercial terms or to pressure us on price reductions or to not accept price increases resulting from unexpected or additional cost increases or fees associated with our suppliers. We have experienced pricing pressure from certain key customers, and we expect that the average selling prices ("ASPs") for certain of our products will decline from time to time, potentially reducing our revenue, margins, and earnings. Our key customer relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges. Our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet tight development schedules. In addition, we have entered, and may again enter in the future, into customer agreements providing for exclusivity periods during which we may only sell specified products or technology to a specific customer. Even without exclusivity periods, the products that we develop are often specific to our customer's system architecture and frequently cannot be sold to other customers. Accordingly, we have in the past and may in the future devote a substantial amount of resources to strategic relationships, which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects or the development of next-generation products and technologies. Notwithstanding our efforts, our customers are not always obligated to purchase new products that we develop for them, and their failure to do so could have a material effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. For example, in April 2023, we were informed that a new product that we had developed for a key customer for introduction in the fall of calendar 2023 was no longer expected to come to market as planned. Our reliance on certain customers may continue to increase, which could heighten the risks associated with having key customers, including making us more vulnerable to significant reductions in revenue, margins, and earnings; pricing pressure; and other adverse effects on our business. 
 
 We depend on the use of information technology systems; disruptions to these systems could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations and have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 
 
 Our business relies on the security and availability of our information technology systems and solutions, such as hardware, software, cloud services, and networks. This includes, among other things, human capital solutions, financial solutions, customer relationship management solutions, design and software development solutions and tools, and data center processing. While we own and manage some of these information technology systems directly, we also rely on third-party information technology systems in the operation of our business. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if any of these systems are disrupted for any reason, including information technology system failures or cyber-attacks; natural disasters; power or water shortages; political, social or economic instability including military, terrorist, or other catastrophic events; labor disruptions; insolvency of third-parties on which we rely; or other operational issues or system failures. We have experienced outages in the past and could be subjected to periods in which our systems and solutions or the third-party systems on which we rely are negatively impacted, degraded or unavailable, potentially for extended periods of time. If this were to occur, we could be subject to data loss or corruption, inability to accurately process or record transactions, reputational harm, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liabilities, and our business, revenues, profitability and financial condition could be negatively impacted.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 The following table provides information about purchases of equity securities that are registered by us pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the three months ended September 28, 2024 (in thousands, except per share amounts): 
 
 Monthly Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) June 30, 2024 - July 27, 2024 274,141 July 28, 2024 - August 24, 2024 258 139.41 258 238,152 August 25, 2024 - September 28, 2024 98 142.48 98 224,147 Total 356 140.26 356 224,147 
 
 (1) The Company currently has one active share repurchase authorization, the 500 million in share repurchases authorized by the Board of Directors in July 2022. Share repurchases are to be funded from existing cash and intended to be effected from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws through the open market, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing of repurchases and the actual amount purchased depend on a variety of factors including general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations. The authorization does not have an expiration date, does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. The Company repurchased 0.4 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate of 50.0 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 under the 2022 share repurchase authorization. These shares were repurchased in the open market and were funded from existing cash. All shares of our common stock that were repurchased were retired as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 The Company's net stock repurchases are subject to a 1 percent excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act, included as a reduction to accumulated earnings in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Disclosure of repurchased amounts and related average costs exclude the impact of excise taxes.
