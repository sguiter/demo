 Cash Equivalents 
 The fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on quoted market prices for similar or identical securities. 
 
 Marketable Securities 
 We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale and value them utilizing a market approach. Our investments are priced by pricing vendors who provide observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant judgment. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair value. Our broker-priced investments are categorized as Level 2 investments because fair value is based on similar assets without applying significant judgments. In addition, all investments have a sufficient trading volume to demonstrate that the fair value is appropriate.

 program to repurchase up to million of outstanding common stock to offset potential dilution from issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation programs. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, we repurchased and retired shares of common stock for million and shares of common stock for million, respectively, utilizing the remaining shares available for repurchase under the program. 
 
 On October 30, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized an additional program to repurchase up to million of outstanding common stock, with the primary purpose of offsetting potential dilution from issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation programs. This share repurchase program will expire on October 30, 2025. During fiscal 2023 we repurchased and retired shares of common stock for million. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased and retired shares of common stock for million, and as of September 28, 2024, million remained available for future repurchases. 
 
 Our policy related to repurchases of our common stock is to charge the excess of cost over par value to additional paid-in capital once the shares are retired. Share repurchases are subject to an excise tax enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act that is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase, net of the fair market value of certain new stock issuances during the same taxable year. Certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The excise tax incurred

 On August 5, 2024, we granted PRSUs to certain senior executives for a total grant date fair value of million which will be recognized ratably over the requisite service period. The number of PRSUs granted represents the target number of units that can be earned based on the performance criteria. The performance criteria are based on Total Shareholder Returns TSR for the period of July 1, 2024 - June 30, 2027, relative to the TSR of the companies identified as being part of the S P Semiconductors Select Industry Index (FormFactor peer companies) as of the grant date. 
 
 Of the PRSUs granted in fiscal 2021, shares were forfeited during the requisite service period, resulting in shares vesting in 2024. These shares achieved TSR performance, which resulted in an additional shares issued in fiscal 2024 in excess of the target number of units related to the fiscal 2021 PRSU grant.

 million of remaining performance obligations, which were comprised of deferred service contracts, extended warranty contracts, and contracts with overtime revenue recognition that are not yet delivered. We expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in the remainder of fiscal 2024, approximately in fiscal 2025, and approximately in fiscal 2026 and thereafter. The foregoing excludes the value of other remaining performance obligations as they have original durations of one year or less, and also excludes information about variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation. 
 
 Contract balances: The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Accounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. A receivable is recognized in the period we deliver goods or provide services or when our right to consideration is unconditional. A contract asset is recorded when we have performed under the contract but our right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively, and are reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets. 
 
 Contract liabilities include payments received and payments due in advance of performance under a contract and are satisfied as the associated revenue is recognized. Contract liabilities are reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of each reporting period as a component of Deferred revenue and Other liabilities. Contract liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recognized million of revenue that was included in contract liabilities as of December 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we divested contract liabilities of million as of December 30, 2023 with the divestiture of our China operations. 
 
 Costs to obtain a contract: We generally expense sales commissions when incurred as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense, as the amortization period is typically less than one year.

Sales of our probe cards and analytical probes are included in the Probe Cards segment, while sales of our probe stations, thermal systems and cryogenic systems are included in the Systems segment. 
 
 We generated net income of 59.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to 6.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, certain areas of the semiconductor industry strengthened, increasing demand in most markets within our Probe Cards segment, particularly with demand for high bandwidth memory HBM chips utilized in generative artificial intelligence applications, ramp of new mobile application processor designs, and demand for client PC and server microprocessor designs. While we experienced growth in total revenues during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our Systems segment revenues were negatively impacted due to the absence of metrology system sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as a result of the sale of our FRT Metrology business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Additionally, the increase in net income was partially attributable to the 20.3 million gain recognized from the completion of the sale of our China operations and establishment of an exclusive distribution and partnership agreement to continue sales and support of our products in the region (the China Transaction ).

 (1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our FRT Metrology business. As a result, metrology systems revenue will not recur in future periods. We generated no metrology systems revenue during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 8.0 million and 16.7 million, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Foundry Logic The increase in Foundry Logic product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by the ramp of new mobile application processor designs and stronger probe-card demand for client PC and server microprocessor designs. 
 
 DRAM The increase in DRAM product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by increased demand for HBM designs utilized in generative artificial intelligence applications and increased demand for commodity DRAM designs, particularly DDR5. 
 
 Flash The increase in Flash product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by increased customer production activity and demand for our products. 
 
 Systems The decrease in Systems market revenue for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by the absence of metrology systems revenue due to the sale of our FRT Metrology business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The fluctuation in Systems revenue from sources not associated with metrology systems for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine 
 24 

months ended September 30, 2023, was an increase of 0.6 million, or 1.6 , and a decrease of 8.8 million, or 8.2 , respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was from increased sales of cryogenic systems, partially offset by decreased sales of thermal systems. The decrease for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was from decreased sales of stations and thermal systems, partially offset by an increase in sales of cryogenic stations. 
 
 Revenues by Geographic Region 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 of Revenues September 30, 2023 of Revenues September 28, 2024 of Revenue September 30, 2023 of Revenue (Dollars in thousands) South Korea 41,728 20.1 35,075 20.4 141,552 24.7 83,713 16.9 United States 55,015 26.5 43,725 25.5 148,672 25.9 124,129 25.1 Taiwan 47,922 23.0 42,975 25.0 122,612 21.4 112,816 22.8 China 34,513 16.6 21,750 12.7 75,213 13.1 72,357 14.6 Europe 7,756 3.7 9,296 5.4 25,420 4.4 29,538 6.0 Japan 8,056 3.9 6,964 4.1 24,209 4.2 25,873 5.2 Malaysia 5,280 2.5 5,964 3.5 13,745 2.4 23,911 4.8 Singapore 5,475 2.6 3,677 2.1 14,755 2.6 11,840 2.4 Rest of the world 2,172 1.1 2,149 1.3 7,938 1.3 10,762 2.2 Total revenues 207,917 100.0 171,575 100.0 574,116 100.0 494,939 100.0 
 
 Geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we ship the product. For example, if a certain South Korean customer purchases through its U.S. subsidiary and requests the products to be shipped to an address in South Korea, this sale will be reflected in the revenue for South Korea rather than the U.S. 
 
 Changes in revenue by geographic region for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily attributable to changes in customer demand, shifts in customer regional manufacturing strategies, particularly with our large multinational customers, product sales mix, and impacts from trade restrictions. Specifically, the changes in revenue by geographic region was attributable to the following: 
 The increase in revenue for South Korea for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven principally by increased demand for our DRAM probe card products, including those for HBM. 
 The increase in revenues for the United States and the decrease in revenues for Malaysia, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were driven principally by a single large U.S.-based company with operations in these regions that shifted shipments from these regions to the United States. 
 The overall increase in revenues for China for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by increased demand from a large Chinese DRAM integrated device manufacturer. 
 Despite the increase in revenues for China previously described, expanded export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 for exporting advanced U.S. semiconductor technology to China has negatively impacted revenue for that region. These requirements have restricted our ability to ship products to the region, decreasing demand from domestic China customers. Additionally, these requirements have caused, and continue to drive, some of our multinational customers to concentrate operations in regions other than China, lowering overall demand for those customers within the region. 
 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margins 
 Cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials, compensation and benefits, shipping and handling costs, manufacturing-related overhead (including equipment costs, related occupancy, and computer services), warranty costs, inventory adjustments (including write-downs for inventory obsolescence), and amortization of certain intangible assets. Our manufacturing operations rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products, some of which are a sole source. We order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders. Tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues. We expense all warranty costs, inventory provisions and amortization of certain intangible assets as cost of revenues.

 Probe Cards For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, gross profit and gross margins increased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to greater revenues and a more favorable absorption of costs on higher production volumes. This was partially offset by an unfavorable product mix with a higher concentration of lower-margin DRAM sales and a lower concentration of higher-margin Foundry Logic sales. For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, DRAM revenue was up from 21.4 and 21.0 of Probe Card sales to 35.0 and 34.5 of Probe Card sales, and Foundry Logic revenue was down from 75.1 and 75.4 of Probe Card sales to 62.4 and 62.6 of Probe Card sales. In general, our DRAM products have lower margins than our Foundry Logic products. 
 
 Systems For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, gross profit and gross margins decreased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of lower revenues and a less favorable absorption of costs on lower production volumes, and a less favorable product mix, in part related to the divestiture of the FRT Metrology business. 
 
 Corporate and Other Corporate and Other includes unallocated expenses relating to stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, inventory and fixed asset fair value adjustments due to acquisitions, and restructuring charges, net, which are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our reportable segments. For the three months ended September 28, 2024, the Corporate and Other gross loss increased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from the an increase in stock-based compensation expense and restructuring charges that were partially offset due to the absence of amortization expense associated with our FRT Metrology business, which was sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Corporate and Other gross loss decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from the absence of amortization expense associated with our FRT Metrology business, which was sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Overall Gross profit and gross margins fluctuate with revenue levels, product mix, selling prices, factory loading, and material costs. For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross profit and gross margins have increased primarily as a result of more favorable absorption of costs and lower inventory excess and obsolescence reserves, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix, as described above.

 Research and development expenses in the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to increased employee compensation costs from higher performance-based compensation and increased general operational costs, partially offset by lower compensation costs from decreased headcount as a result of the sale of our FRT Metrology business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and the China Transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, lower project material costs, and lower stock-based compensation expense. 
 
 Research and development expenses in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to increased employee compensation costs from higher performance-based compensation, general operational costs, and increased project material costs, partially offset by lower compensation costs from decreased headcount as a result of the sale of our FRT Metrology business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and the China Transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was effectively flat. The drivers of the fluctuation for the three month period were increased employee compensation costs from higher performance-based compensation and increased commissions expense from increased revenues, mostly offset by lower stock-based compensation expenses, lower transaction expenses related to the sale of our FRT Metrology business earlier in 2024, and lower general operating expenses. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The drivers of the increase for the nine month period were increased employee compensation costs from higher performance-based compensation, increased commissions expense from increased revenues, increased consulting fees from the China Transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and increased general operating expenses, partially offset by lower amortization expense from significant intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

Interest Income (Expense), Net 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Interest Income 3,770 1,765 10,542 4,739 Weighted average balance of cash and investments 363,178 233,001 349,157 232,710 Weighted average yield on cash and investments 4.68 3.79 4.59 3.33 Interest Expense 120 103 321 319 Average debt outstanding 13,651 14,718 13,920 14,980 Weighted average interest rate on debt 2.75 2.75 2.75 2.75 
 
 Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. The increase in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared with the corresponding period of the prior year, was attributable to higher invested balances. 
 
 Interest expense primarily includes interest on our term loan, interest rate swap derivative contracts, and term loan issuance costs amortization charges. The interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was effectively flat compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. This stability is due to our interest rate swap, which fixes the interest rate on our long-term debt. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net, primarily includes the effects of foreign currency and various other gains and losses. We partially mitigate our risks from currency movements by hedging certain balance sheet exposures, which minimizes the impacts during periods of foreign exchange volatility. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes 2,211 786 7,564 626 Effective tax rate 10.6 15.2 11.2 8.7 
 
 Provision for income taxes reflects the tax provision on our operations in foreign and U.S. jurisdictions, offset by tax benefits from tax credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. Our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss by jurisdiction, changes to the valuation allowance, changes to U.S. federal, state or foreign tax laws, changes in stock-based compensation expense/benefit, future expansion into areas with varying country, state, and local income tax rates, and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily driven by stock-based compensation expense/benefit impacts on the provision for income tax expense. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily driven by higher taxable U.S. income during fiscal 2024. 
 
 The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 CHIPS Act was signed into law on August 9, 2022. The CHIPS Act provides for various incentives and tax credits, among other items, including the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit AMIC ), which equals 25 of qualified investments in an advanced manufacturing facility that is placed in service after December 31, 2022. At least a portion of our future capital expenditures and research and development costs is expected to qualify for this credit, which benefits us by allowing us to net the credit received against our costs. The AMIC credit is accounted for outside of ASC 740 as a reduction to the depreciable basis of the assets used in operations and will not have an impact on our effective tax rate. 
 
 Beginning in 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the existing option to deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures attributable to domestic and foreign research over five and 
 29 

fifteen years, respectively, pursuant to IRC Section 174. While the capitalization requirement has a negative impact on our cash flows, there are offsetting benefits from the enactment of this provision that we have included in our estimated annual effective tax rate. While it is possible that Congress may defer, modify, or repeal this provision, potentially with retroactive effect, we have no assurance that this provision will be deferred, modified, or repealed. Changes in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation or agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Our working capital increased to 485.6 million at September 28, 2024, compared to 442.7 million at December 30, 2023. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at banks and money market funds. Marketable securities primarily consist of corporate bonds, U.S. treasuries, U.S. agency securities, and commercial paper. We typically invest in highly rated securities with low probabilities of default. Our investment policy requires investments to be rated single A or better, and limits the types of acceptable investments, issuer concentration and duration of the investment. 
 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately 354.5 million at September 28, 2024, compared to 328.3 million at December 30, 2023. Based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand, and the cash we expect to generate from operations, will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arising from: research and development, capital expenditures, working capital, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations. However, we cannot be certain that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand, and cash generated from operations, will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements. In addition, any future strategic investments and significant acquisitions may require additional cash and capital resources. To the extent necessary, we may consider entering into short and long-term debt obligations, raising cash through a stock issuance, or obtaining new financing facilities, which may not be available on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 If we are unsuccessful in maintaining or growing our revenues, maintaining or reducing our cost structure, or increasing our available cash through debt or equity financings, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may decline. 
 
 We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where needed. As part of these strategies, we indefinitely reinvest a portion of our foreign earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely-reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 81,621 55,352 Net cash used in investing activities (26,152) (49,994) Net cash used in financing activities (46,256) (1,308) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consists of net income for the period, adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was attributable to net income of 59.9 million and net non-cash expenses of 32.0 million, partially offset by the increase in net working capital of 10.3 million. The cash used in net working capital is related to increased accounts receivable, net, of 13.3 million, increased inventories of 7.6 million, decreased accounts payable of 8.8 million, and decreased operating lease liabilities of 5.3 million, largely offset by increased accrued liabilities of 7.4 million, other liabilities of 9.3 million, and deferred revenue of 7.9 million. The non-cash expenses consisted of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and the provision for excess and obsolete inventories, partially offset by the 20.6 million gain on sale of business and deferred income tax benefits. 
 
 30 

Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 primarily related to 30.8 million in property, plant and equipment purchases and 15.5 million in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by 21.6 million cash provided by the sale of businesses. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 primarily related to 37.2 million used to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program, 18.0 million used to pay tax withholdings for net share settlements of employee stock awards, partially offset by 9.7 million received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. 
 
 Debt 
 
 On June 22, 2020, we entered into an 18.0 million 15-year credit facility loan agreement (the Building Term Loan ). The proceeds of the Building Term Loan were used to purchase a building adjacent to our leased facilities in Livermore, California. On May 19, 2023, we amended the Building Term Loan, replacing the benchmark reference rate London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), with no change to the amount or timing of contractual cash flows. 
 
 The Building Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate, plus 1.86 per annum. Interest payments are payable in monthly installments over a fifteen-year period. The interest rate at September 28, 2024, before consideration of the interest rate swap discussed in the next paragraph, was 7.07 . As of September 28, 2024, the balance outstanding pursuant to the Building Term Loan was 13.6 million. 
 
 On March 17, 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest payment on the Building Term Loan for the notional amount of 18.0 million, and an amortization period that matches the debt. As future levels of LIBOR over the life of the loan are uncertain, we entered into this interest-rate swap agreement to hedge the exposure in interest rate risks associated with movement in LIBOR rates. This agreement was amended on May 19, 2023 to replace the benchmark reference rate LIBOR with SOFR to match the Building Term Loan agreement (as amended). After the amendment, the interest rate swap continues to convert our floating-rate interest into a fixed-rate at 2.75 . As of September 28, 2024, the notional amount of the loan that is subject to this interest rate swap is 13.6 million. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Programs 
 
 On May 20, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a two-year program to repurchase up to 75.0 million of outstanding common stock to offset potential dilution from issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation programs. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, we repurchased and retired 1,700,893 shares of common stock for 56.4 million and 504,352 shares of common stock for 18.6 million, respectively, utilizing the remaining shares available for repurchase under the program. 
 
 On October 30, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized an additional two-year program to repurchase up to 75.0 million of outstanding common stock, with the primary purpose of offsetting potential dilution from issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation programs. This share repurchase program will expire on October 30, 2025. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased and retired 32,020 shares of common stock for 1.2 million. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased and retired 889,683 shares of common stock for 37.2 million, and as of September 28, 2024, 36.6 million remained available for future repurchases.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

 (1) Represents our minimum interest payment commitments at 7.07 per annum, excluding the interest rate swap described in Debt , above. 
 
 The table above excludes our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits and our deferred grant. The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 50.3 million as of September 28, 2024. The timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors and, accordingly, the timing of payment cannot be estimated. The deferred grant was 18.0 million as of September 28, 2024, and consists of cash received from a California Competes Grant awarded from the California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development. The timing of any potential repayments is dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of employees and capital investments within California over the 5-year term. Accordingly, the timing of any repayment cannot be estimated. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Historically, we have not participated in transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of September 28, 2024, we were not involved in any such off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Recent Accounting Standards 
 
 For a description of a recent change in accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, in our condensed consolidated financial statements, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk contained in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 30, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Based on our management s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act )) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 32 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives are being met. Further, the design of any control systems must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
 
 CEO and CFO Certifications 
 
 We have attached as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with the Exchange Act. We recommend that this Item 4 be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the subject matter presented. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes during the three months ended September 28, 2024 to the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. If any of the identified risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. The trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Repurchase of Common Stock 
 
 The following table summarizes our repurchases of outstanding common stock for the three months ended September 28, 2024:

 1 In October 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 75.0 million of outstanding common stock to offset potential dilution from issuances of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and equity incentive plan. Under the authorized stock repurchase program, we may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market. The pace of repurchase activity will depend on levels of cash generation, current stock price and other factors. The program may be modified or discontinued at any time. This share repurchase program will expire October 2025. 
 2 Amounts include the 1 surcharge on stock repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act s excise tax. This excise tax is recorded in equity and reduces the amount available under the repurchase program, as applicable.
