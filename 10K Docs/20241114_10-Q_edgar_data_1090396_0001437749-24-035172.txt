 The Company offers qualified customers a licensing agreement. Licensing revenue is recognized after the intellectual property (CMS system), the performance obligation, is delivered and in its operational and functional state. The SSP for licensing revenue is established based upon actual selling prices for the license.

 Significant Judgments 
 
 Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. 
 
 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation, including lease and non-lease components. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when we sell a product or service separately. 
 
 In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we perform a gross margin analysis using information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. 
 
 We recognize a contract asset when our performance under a contract precedes our receipt of consideration from a customer, or before payment is due, and our receipt of consideration is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. A contract asset is recognized when we have an unconditional right to payment for our performance. Our contract asset consists of our in-process installations, for which we have an enforceable right to collect consideration (including a reasonable profit) in the event the services are cancelled by customers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we recorded a contract asset of approximately and , respectively, as a component of accounts receivable. 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, the balance of accounts receivable, net and customer deposits were and 1,485,622, respectively. 
 
 The collectability assessment requires the company to use judgement and consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Management exercises judgment in its assessment of collectability of customer funds by considering payment history, current credit status, and available information about the financial condition of the customer, among other factors. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approx imately and for systems installed under contract have not been recorded as revenue or included in accounts receivable based on the collectability assessment performed by the Company. In accordance with this assessment, the contracts will be assessed in subsequent quarters at which time they may be deemed collectable and the outstanding remaining system revenue will be recognized accordingly. During the quarter ending September 30, 2024, a casino, previously included in this assessment, discontinued its business operations resulting in the noted decrease. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 the company has received substantially all of the site's inventory installed. 
 
 We evaluate the interest rates in customer contracts with extended payment terms, representing a significant financing component. These rates range from approxim ately to and we b elieve those to be appropriate market interest rates for the financing component. 

, while the other matures in February 2025 and has an interest rate of . Certificates of deposit held for investment with an original maturity greater than three months are carried at cost plus accrued interest and reported as short-term investments on the balance sheet. Interest is paid at maturity. At times, certain certificates may exceed amounts insured by the FDIC. The Company determines the appropriate classification as short-term or long-term at the time of purchase based on original maturities and management's reasonable redemption expectation. The Company reevaluates such classification at each balance sheet date.
