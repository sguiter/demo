 Due to impacts from seasonal variations in the demand for air travel, the volatility of aircraft fuel prices, the impact of macroeconomic conditions, and other factors, operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for other interim periods or for the full year ending December 31, 2024.

 In June 2024, the Company entered into the A R ATSA with Amazon that will increase the number of 737-800 cargo aircraft that Sun Country operates on behalf of Amazon from to . The A R ATSA includes revised economics to reflect the higher-cost environment that has ensued since the original Air Transportation Services Agreement ("ATSA") was signed in December 2019. The A R ATSA contains three performance obligations: Flight Services, Heavy Maintenance and Fuel; all of which are unchanged from the original ATSA. The first additional aircraft is expected to begin service in the first quarter of 2025, and all

 aircraft are expected to be operational by the end of the third quarter of 2025. The A R ATSA includes an initial term, which expires in October 2030. The agreement includes additional, renewal terms exercisable at Amazon's option, and a subsequent renewal term subject to mutual written agreement, which, if not agreed to, will trigger a final wind-down term. The Company did not receive any material financial reimbursements for start-up costs incurred in connection with the incremental aircraft. The warrant agreement was not amended in connection with the A R ATSA, Amazon did not receive any additional warrants in connection with the A R ATSA. Accordingly, warrants issued to Amazon will continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement executed in December 2019. 
 Charter Ancillary Passenger Cargo Other Total Operating Revenues 
 The Company attributes and measures its Operating Revenues by geographic region as defined by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") for airline reporting based upon the origin of each passenger and cargo flight segment. 
 The Company s operations are highly concentrated in the U.S., but include service to many international locations, primarily consisting of scheduled service to Latin America and military charter service to various international destinations. 
 Latin America Other Total Operating Revenues 
 Contract Balances 
 The Company s contract assets relate to costs incurred to prepare the Amazon cargo aircraft for service under the original ATSA and the A R ATSA, as well as warrants that have vested and will be amortized against Cargo revenue over the remaining term of the A R ATSA.

 Total Contract Assets Contract Liabilities Air Traffic Liabilities Loyalty Program Liabilities Amazon Contract Total Contract Liabilities 
 The balance in the Air Traffic Liabilities fluctuates with seasonal travel patterns. Most tickets can be purchased no more than twelve months in advance, therefore any revenue associated with tickets sold for future travel will be recognized within that timeframe. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of revenue was recognized in Passenger revenue that was included in the Air Traffic Liabilities as of December 31, 2023. 
 Loyalty Program 
 The Sun Country Rewards program provides loyalty awards to program members based on accumulated loyalty points. The Company records a liability for loyalty points earned by passengers under the Sun Country Rewards program using two methods: 1) a liability for points that are earned by passengers on purchases of the Company s services is established by deferring revenue based on the redemption value, net of estimated loyalty points that will expire unused, or breakage; and 2) a liability for points attributed to loyalty points issued to the Company s Visa card holders is established by deferring a portion of payments received from the Company s co-branded agreement. The balance of the Loyalty Program Liabilities fluctuates based on seasonal patterns, which impacts the volume of loyalty points awarded through travel or issued to co-branded credit card and other partners (deferral of revenue) and loyalty points redeemed (recognition of revenue). Due to these reasons, the timing of loyalty point redemptions can vary significantly.

The lease amendment modified the classification of this lease from an operating lease to a finance lease and has an expiration date in fiscal year 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, management approved a plan to retire an owned aircraft. Certain parts of the aircraft were maintained for future use by the Company or held for sale.

 for the purpose of financing the Owned Aircraft Held for Operating Lease. The loan is repaid monthly through March 2030. During the lease term, payments collected from the lessee are applied directly to the repayment of principal and interest on the term loan credit facility.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Also discussed is our financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This section should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and discussion under the heading, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, assumptions and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and forecasts. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section of this report titled, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. You should carefully read the Risk Factors included in our 2023 10-K to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 
 
 Business Overview 
 Sun Country is a new breed of hybrid low-cost air carrier that dynamically deploys shared resources across our synergistic Scheduled Service, Charter, and Cargo businesses. By doing so, we believe we are able to generate high growth, high margins and strong cash flows with greater resilience than other passenger airlines. Based in Minnesota, we focus on serving leisure and visiting friends and relatives ("VFR") passengers, Charter customers and providing crew, maintenance and insurance CMI service to Amazon, with flights throughout the U.S. and to destinations in Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. We share resources, such as flight crews, across our Scheduled Service, Charter and Cargo business lines with the objective of generating high returns and margins and mitigating the seasonality of our route network. We optimize capacity using an agile peak demand scheduling strategy which aims to shift flying to markets during periods of peak demand and away from markets during periods of low demand. We believe this flexible business model provides greater resiliency to economic and industry downturns than a traditional scheduled service carrier. This strategy has been implemented and executed by an experienced management team with deep knowledge of the industry. 
 Our Scheduled Service business combines low costs with a high-quality product to generate higher Total Revenue per Available Seat Mile TRASM than Ultra Low-Cost Carriers ULCCs while maintaining lower Adjusted Cost per Available Seat Mile CASM than Low Cost Carriers LCCs ), resulting in best-in-class unit profitability. Our business includes many cost characteristics of ULCCs, such as an unbundled product (which means we offer a base fare and allow customers to purchase ancillary products and services for an additional fee), point-to-point service and a single-family fleet of Boeing 737-NG aircraft, which allow us to maintain a cost base comparable to ULCCs. However, we offer a high-quality product that we believe is superior to ULCCs and consistent with that of LCCs. For example, our product includes more average legroom than ULCCs, complimentary soft drinks and juices, complimentary in-flight entertainment, and in-seat power, none of which are offered by other ULCCs. 
 Our Charter business, which is one of the largest narrow body Charter operations in the United States, is synergistic with our other businesses and provides both inherent diversification and downside protection. Our

Charter business has several favorable characteristics, including: large repeat customers, more stable demand than Scheduled Service flying, and the ability to pass through certain costs, including fuel. Our diverse Charter customer base includes the DoD, collegiate and professional sports teams, and casino operators. Our Charter business includes ad hoc, repeat, short-term and long-term service contracts with pass through fuel arrangements and annual rate escalations. Most of our business is non-cyclical because the DoD and sports teams continue to fly during normal economic downturns and our casino contracts are long-term in nature. 
 On December 13, 2019, we signed the ATSA with Amazon to provide air cargo services. Flying under the ATSA began in May 2020 and we are currently operating 12 Boeing 737-800 cargo aircraft for Amazon. In June 2024, the Company entered into the A R ATSA with Amazon that will increase the number of 737-800 cargo aircraft that Sun Country operates on behalf of Amazon from 12 to 20. The A R ATSA includes revised economics to reflect the higher-cost environment that has ensued since the original ATSA was signed in December 2019. The first additional aircraft is expected to begin service in the first quarter of 2025, and all eight aircraft are expected to be operational by the end of the third quarter of 2025. The A R ATSA includes an initial six-year term, which expires in October 2030. The agreement includes two additional, two-year renewal terms exercisable at Amazon's option, and a subsequent three-year renewal term subject to mutual written agreement, which, if not agreed to, will trigger a final two-year wind-down term. 
 Our CMI service is asset-light from a Sun Country perspective as Amazon supplies the aircraft and covers many of the operating expenses, including fuel, and provides all cargo loading and unloading services. We are responsible for flying the aircraft under our air carrier certificate, crew, aircraft line maintenance and insurance, all of which allow us to leverage our existing operational expertise from our passenger businesses. Our cargo business also enables us to leverage certain assets, capabilities, and fixed costs to enhance profitability and promote growth across our Company. 
 
 Operations in Review 
 We believe a key component of our success is establishing Sun Country as a high growth, low-cost carrier in the United States by attracting customers with low fares and garnering repeat business by delivering a high-quality passenger experience, offering state-of-the-art interiors, complimentary streaming of in-flight entertainment to passenger devices, seat reclining and seat-back power in all our aircraft. 
 Fuel price volatility, due to market conditions and geopolitical events and the impact of macroeconomic conditions, continue to impact the Company, as well as the industry. Our diversified business model, which includes a focus on leisure and VFR passengers, Charter and Cargo service, is unique in the airline sector and helps mitigate the impact of economic and industry downturns on our business when compared with other large U.S. passenger airlines. This strategy has allowed us to offset a majority of additional costs associated with fuel price volatility and the impact of macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, our Charter and Cargo businesses have the ability to pass on certain costs, including fuel. Our flexible business model gives us the ability to adjust our services in response to market conditions, which is targeted at producing the highest possible returns for Sun Country.

 Total Operating Revenues were 249,470 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The quarter-over-quarter change in Total Operating Revenues was nominal. The increase in rental revenue included within Other revenue, as well as the increase in Cargo revenue due to the A R ATSA, were largely offset by a decrease in Passenger revenue as a result of an 8 decrease in total fare per passenger. These items are discussed in further detail below.

Passenger. Passenger revenue decreased 6,591, or 3 , to 207,764 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The table below presents select operating data for lines of revenue within Passenger, expressed as quarter-over-quarter changes: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Scheduled Service and Ancillary Statistics: Departures 7,259 6,878 6 Block Hours 21,416 19,935 7 Passengers 1,112,455 1,090,172 2 Average base fare per passenger 75.31 88.50 (15) Ancillary revenue per passenger 65.81 64.61 2 Total fare per passenger 141.13 153.11 (8) RPMs (thousands) 1,288,460 1,252,583 3 ASMs (thousands) 1,530,058 1,446,462 6 TRASM (cents) 10.42 11.72 (11) Passenger load factor 84.2 86.6 (2.4) Charter Statistics: Departures 2,809 2,688 5 Block hours 5,366 5,274 2 Charter revenue per block hour 9,462 8,994 5 
 The decreases in both total fare per passenger and TRASM were impacted by increased capacity across the industry. The increase in capacity by the Company and across the industry also had an impact on the 2.4 reduction in load factor. Volume increases due to operational growth partially offset the quarter-over-quarter decreases in both total fare per passenger, TRASM, and load factor. As a result of the operational growth, both Scheduled Service departures and ASMs increased by 6 , which drove the 2 increase in passengers. The 2 increase in Schedule Service passengers during the period also resulted in greater sales of ancillary products. 
 Passenger revenue benefited from the 3,332, or 7 , increase in Charter revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was the result of a 5 improvement in Charter revenue per block hour and a 2 increase in block hours. The improvement in Charter revenue per block hour was due to rate increases and management initiatives to reduce the number of ferry flights. 
 Cargo . Revenue from cargo services increased 3,106, or 12 , to 29,165 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by rate escalations as a result of the A R ATSA, partially offset by a 4 quarter-over-quarter decrease in block hours. 
 Other . Other revenue increased 4,079, or 48 , to 12,541 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenue benefited from the 10,092 of rental revenue primarily associated with seven leased aircraft during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5,870 of rental revenue associated with five leased aircraft during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating Expenses 
 Aircraft Fuel . We believe Aircraft Fuel expense, excluding indirect fuel credits, is the best measure of the effect of fuel prices on our business as it consists solely of direct fuel expenses that are related to our operations and is consistent with how management analyzes our operating performance. This measure is defined as GAAP Aircraft Fuel expense, excluding indirect fuel credits that are recognized within Aircraft Fuel expense, but are not directly related to our Fuel Cost per Gallon. 
 The primary components of Aircraft Fuel expense are shown in the following table: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Total Aircraft Fuel Expense 54,737 61,179 (11) Indirect Fuel Credits 68 175 (61) Aircraft Fuel Expense, Excluding Indirect Fuel Credits 54,805 61,354 (11) Fuel Gallons Consumed (thousands) 20,344 19,262 6 Fuel Cost per Gallon, Excluding Indirect Fuel Credits 2.69 3.19 (16) 
 Aircraft Fuel expense decreased 11 quarter-over-quarter due to a 16 decrease in the average fuel cost per gallon. This was partially offset by a 6 increase in consumption as a result of our operational growth. 
 Salaries , Wages, and Benefits . Salaries, Wages, and Benefits expense increased 8,378, or 12 , to 80,919 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase in Salaries, Wages, and Benefits was impacted by a 10 increase in employee headcount, an increase in total system block hours as a result of operational growth, and contractual rate increases for our pilots. 
 Aircraft Rent . Aircraft Rent expense was nominal for both periods presented as a result of our aircraft fleet shifting from aircraft under operating leases to all owned aircraft or aircraft under finance leases. 
 Maintenance . Maintenance expense increased 643, or 4 , to 15,973 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase in Maintenance expense was primarily driven by an increase in landing gear events as well as an increase in the size of our fleet and operations. These were partially offset by a decrease in routine, time-based heavy maintenance events. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and Marketing expense increased 179, or 2 , to 7,748 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by a rise in Global Distribution System ("GDS") fees as a result of an increase in sales through indirect distribution channels, as well as increases in advertising and other expenses. These were partially offset by a reduction in credit card fees as a result of the decrease in total fare per passenger. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and Amortization expense increased 992, or 4 , to 23,754 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the impact of a change in the composition of our aircraft fleet that resulted in an increased number of owned aircraft and aircraft under finance leases. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 51 and 47 aircraft that were owned or under finance leases, respectively.

Ground Handling . Ground Handling expense increased 2,186, or 23 , to 11,568, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This quarter-over-quarter increase was the result of a 5 increase in Passenger segment departures as a result of our expanding operations, as well as rate increases due to market pressures. 
 Landing Fees and Airport Rent . Landing Fees and Airport Rent increased 2,021, or 14 , to 15,979 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This quarter-over-quarter increase was the result of a 5 increase in Passenger segment departures as a result of our expanding operations, as well as rate increases due to market pressures. 
 Other Operating, net . Other operating, net decreased 717, or 3 , to 26,410 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of our part sales programs, partially offset by an increase in operations. 
 Non-operating Income (Expense) 
 Interest Income . Interest income decreased 821, or 33 , to 1,659 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the Company's average investment balance quarter-over-quarter. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased 354, or 3 , to 11,049 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreasing debt balances and aircraft purchased with operating cash, partially offset by an increase in aircraft under finance leases.

 Other, net . Other, net did not change by a material amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Tax. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.0 compared to 24.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a reduction in the impact of permanent stock compensation items.

 Total Operating Revenues increased 11,257, or 1 , to 815,334 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue growth was driven by an increase in rental revenue included within Other revenue, as well as an increase in Cargo revenue due to the A R ATSA, partially offset by a decrease in Passenger revenue as a result of a 13 decrease in total fare per passenger which was impacted by increased industry capacity. These items are discussed in further detail below.

Passenger. Passenger revenue decreased 10,667, or 2 , to 698,823 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The table below presents select operating data for lines of revenue within Passenger, expressed as year-over-year changes: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Scheduled Service and Ancillary Statistics: Departures 22,109 19,456 14 Block Hours 70,312 61,438 14 Passengers 3,437,005 3,093,536 11 Average base fare per passenger 91.08 116.57 (22) Ancillary revenue per passenger 68.86 66.47 4 Total Fare per passenger 159.95 183.04 (13) RPMs (thousands) 4,335,623 3,900,975 11 ASMs (thousands) 5,098,876 4,489,968 14 TRASM (cents) 10.95 12.80 (14) Passenger load factor 85.0 86.9 (1.9) Charter Statistics: Departures 7,638 7,816 (2) Block hours 15,355 15,994 (4) Charter revenue per block hour 9,709 8,956 8 
 The year-over-year decreases in both total fare per passenger and TRASM were impacted by increased capacity across the industry. The increase in capacity by the Company and across the industry also had an impact on the 1.9 reduction in load factor. The fare decreases were offset by a 7 increase in average daily aircraft utilization and growth in the passenger fleet, which supported an increase in volume. As a result, Scheduled Service departures and ASMs increased by 14 , which drove the 11 increase in Scheduled Service passengers. The 11 increase in Scheduled Service passengers during the period also resulted in greater sales of ancillary products. 
 Passenger revenue benefited from the 5,840, or 4 , increase in Charter revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the 8 increase in Charter revenue per block hour. The improvement in Charter revenue per block hour was due to rate increases and management initiatives to reduce the number of ferry flights. 
 Cargo . Revenue from cargo services increased 4,123, or 6 , to 78,560 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by rate escalations as a result of the A R ATSA, partially offset by a 2 year-over-year decrease in block hours. 
 Other . Other revenue increased 17,801, or 88 , to 37,951 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenue benefited from the 29,240 of rental revenue primarily associated with seven leased aircraft during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11,742 in rental revenue associated with five leased aircraft during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating Expenses 
 Aircraft Fuel . We believe Aircraft Fuel expense, excluding indirect fuel credits, is the best measure of the effect of fuel prices on our business as it consists solely of direct fuel expenses that are related to our operations and is consistent with how management analyzes our operating performance. This measure is defined as GAAP Aircraft Fuel expense, excluding indirect fuel credits that are recognized within Aircraft Fuel expense, but are not directly related to our Fuel Cost per Gallon. 
 The primary components of Aircraft Fuel expense are shown in the following table: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Total Aircraft Fuel Expense 187,229 185,829 1 Indirect Fuel Credits 1,290 827 56 Aircraft Fuel Expense, Excluding Indirect Fuel Credits 188,519 186,656 1 Fuel Gallons Consumed (thousands) 65,884 59,734 10 Fuel Cost per Gallon, Excluding Indirect Fuel Credits 2.86 3.12 (8) 
 Aircraft Fuel expense increased 1 year-over-year primarily due to a 10 increase in consumption, partially offset by an 8 decrease in the average fuel cost per gallon. 
 Salaries , Wages, and Benefits . Salaries, Wages, and Benefits expense increased 18,626, or 8 , to 242,516 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase in Salaries, Wages, and Benefits was impacted by a 10 increase in employee headcount, an increase in total system block hours as a result of operational growth, and contractual rate increases for our pilots. 
 Aircraft Rent . Aircraft Rent expense decreased by 2,281 to 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Aircraft Rent expense decreased due to the composition of our aircraft fleet shifting from aircraft under operating leases to all owned aircraft or aircraft under finance leases. 
 Maintenance . Maintenance expense increased 5,818, or 13 , to 50,129 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase in Maintenance expense was primarily driven by an increase in routine, time-based heavy maintenance and landing gear events, as well as the increase in the size of our fleet and operations. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and Marketing expense increased 814, or 3 , to 26,819 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change year-over-year was primarily driven by an increase in advertising and other costs, partially offset by a reduction in credit card fees as a result of the year-over-year decrease in total fare per passenger. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and Amortization expense increased 6,617, or 10 , to 71,194 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the impact of a change in the composition of our aircraft fleet that resulted in an increased number of owned aircraft and aircraft under finance leases. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 51 and 47 aircraft that were owned or under finance leases, respectively.

Ground Handling . Ground Handling expense increased 3,791, or 13 , to 32,090, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of an 9 increase in Passenger segment departures as a result of our expanding operations, as well as rate increases due to market pressures. 
 Landing Fees and Airport Rent . Landing Fees and Airport Rent increased 7,584, or 21 , to 44,431 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of airports exhausting their remaining Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act funding, which increased rates. The increase was also impacted by rate increases due to market pressures and the 9 increase in Passenger segment departures as a result of our expanding operations. 
 Other Operating, net . Other operating, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was materially unchanged year-over-year. This was primarily the result of our part sales programs, mostly offset by an increase in operations. 
 Non-operating Income (Expense) 
 Interest Income . Interest income decreased 1,859, or 24 , to 5,907 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the Company's average investment balance year-over-year. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense increased 1,966, or 6 , to 33,238 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the change in our aircraft fleet that resulted in an increase of aircraft under finance leases and owned aircraft that were financed with debt proceeds. For more information on the Company's Debt, see Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this report. 
 Other, net . Other, net changed by 425 to a net benefit of 55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net expense of 370 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is a result of secondary offering costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Tax. The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.0 compared to 23.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to the impact of permanent stock compensation items.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We sometimes use information that is derived from the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide a meaningful comparison of our results to others in the airline industry and our prior year results. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. We believe certain charges included in our operating expenses on a GAAP basis make it difficult to compare our current period results to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. The tables below show a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this report to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures included as supplemental disclosure because we believe they are useful indicators of our operating performance. Derivations of Operating Income and Net Income are well recognized performance measurements in the airline industry that are frequently used by our management, as well as by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies in our industry. 
 The measures described above have limitations as analytical tools. Some of the limitations applicable to these measures include: they do not reflect the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting each measure s usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, the following non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to the possible differences in the method of calculation and in the items being adjusted. 
 For the foregoing reasons, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA have significant limitations which affect their use as indicators of our profitability. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information . 
 The following table presents the reconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income, and Adjusted Operating Income Margin for the periods presented below.

 CASM and Adjusted CASM 
 CASM is a key airline cost metric defined as operating expenses divided by total available seat miles. Adjusted CASM is a non-GAAP measure derived from CASM by excluding fuel costs, costs related to our cargo operations, depreciation and amortization recognized on certain assets that generate lease income, stock-based compensation, certain commissions and other costs of selling our vacation products from this measure as these costs are unrelated to our airline operations and improve comparability to our peers. Adjusted CASM is 
 -37- 

Table of Contents 
 SUN COUNTRY AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 
 (Unaudited) 

an important measure used by management and by our Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted CASM is commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they compare our airline to others in the industry, although other airlines may exclude certain other costs in their calculation of Adjusted CASM. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. 
 Adjusted CASM excludes fuel costs. By excluding volatile fuel expenses that are outside of our control from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact and trends in company-specific cost drivers, such as labor rates, aircraft costs and maintenance costs, and productivity, which are more controllable by management. 
 We have excluded costs related to the Cargo operations, as well as depreciation and amortization recognized on certain assets that generate lease income as these operations do not create ASMs. The Cargo expenses in the reconciliation below are different from the total operating expenses for our Cargo segment in the Segment Information table presented above, due to several items that are included in the Cargo segment, but have been captured in other line items used in the Adjusted CASM calculation. We have entered into a series of aircraft-related transactions where we serve as an aircraft lessor. As of September 30, 2024, we leased or subleased seven aircraft. Depreciation and Amortization expense on these aircraft materially began during the three months ended June 30, 2023. Adjusted CASM further excludes special items and other adjustments, as defined in the relevant reporting period, that are not representative of the ongoing costs necessary to our airline operations and may improve comparability between periods. We also exclude stock compensation expense when computing Adjusted CASM. The Company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives and is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any period. 
 As derivations of Adjusted CASM are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, derivations of Adjusted CASM as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted CASM should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for CASM. For the aforementioned reasons, Adjusted CASM has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of our profitability. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 included our existing cash and cash equivalents of 56,791 and short-term investments of 89,697, our expected cash generated from operations, and the 24,743 of available funds from the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we had restricted cash of 10,649 as of September 30, 2024, which generally consists of cash received as prepayment for chartered flights that is maintained in separate escrow accounts prior to the date of transportation in accordance with DOT regulations. The restrictions are released once the charter transportation is provided.

 (Unaudited) 

We believe our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, combined with expected future cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot predict what the effect on our business and financial position might be from a change in the competitive environment in which we operate or from events beyond our control, such as volatile fuel prices, economic conditions, pandemics, weather-related disruptions, the impact of airline bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, U.S. military actions, regulations, or acts of terrorism. 
 For a more detailed discussion on our Liquidity and Capital Resources, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Operations in Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 10-K. 
 Aircraft As of September 30, 2024, our fleet consisted of 63 Boeing 737-NG aircraft. This includes 44 aircraft in the passenger fleet, 12 cargo operated aircraft through the ATSA, and seven aircraft currently on lease to unaffiliated airlines. For more information on our fleet, see Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this report. 
 Maintenance Deposits - In addition to funding the acquisition of aircraft, we are required by certain of our aircraft lessors to fund cash reserves in advance for scheduled maintenance to act as collateral for the benefit of the lessors. Qualifying payments that are expected to be recovered from lessors are recorded as Lessor Maintenance Deposits on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, we had 57,658 of total Lessor Maintenance Deposits. All maintenance deposits as of September 30, 2024 are estimated to be recoverable either through reimbursable maintenance events or through application towards the purchase of the aircraft. 
 Investments - We invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid securities with strong credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held 83,280 of debt securities, all of which are classified as current assets because of their highly liquid nature and availability to be converted into cash to fund current operations. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents and the high credit quality of our debt security investments, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our investments to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. 
 We also hold 6,417 of Certificates of Deposit that are included in Investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Facilities - We use our Credit Facilities to provide liquidity support for general corporate purposes and to finance the acquisition of aircraft. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 24,743 of the 25,000 Revolving Credit Facility available due to 257 being pledged to support letters of credit, and no balance drawn. The Company was in compliance with the covenants within the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Debt - At our discretion, we obtain debt financing in order to purchase, or refinance aircraft. The Company has not entered into a debt financing arrangement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For more information on our credit facilities or debt, see Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this report. 
 TRA Liability - During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made a payment of 3,350 and 2,425 to the TRA holders, respectively. Payments will be made in future periods as Pre-IPO Tax Attributes are utilized. For more information on the TRA liability, see Note 8 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this report.

Operating Cash Flow Activities 
 Operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 provided 74,303, as compared to 102,651 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Net Income was 39,467, as compared to 66,536 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our operating cash flow is primarily impacted by the following factors: 
 Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in Air Traffic Liabilities. Air Traffic Liabilities typically increase during the fall and early winter months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the late winter and spring peak travel season and decrease during the summer months. Most tickets can be purchased no more than twelve months in advance, therefore any revenue associated with tickets sold for future travel will be recognized within that timeframe. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 153,708 of revenue recognized in Passenger revenue was included in the 157,996 of Air Traffic Liabilities as of December 31, 2023. 
 Aircraft Fuel. Aircraft Fuel expense represented approximately 25 of our total operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. Fuel cost per gallon decreased by 8 year-over-year. Fuel consumption increased by 10 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year as a result of the increase in fleet size and total operations. We expect volatility in Aircraft Fuel prices per gallon due to market conditions and global geopolitical events. 
 Investing Cash Flow Activities 
 Capital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures were 42,615 and 210,641 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the acquisition of one aircraft and other items not individually material. Our capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included the purchase of five Owned Aircraft Held for Operating Lease and one incremental aircraft for our passenger fleet. 
 Investments. The Company's net investment activity resulted in cash inflows of 52,095 and 28,276 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to maturing debt securities exceeding purchases of investments. 
 Financing Cash Flow Activities 
 Debt . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company executed a term loan credit facility with a face amount of 119,200 for the purpose of financing the five Owned Aircraft Held for Operating Lease. The term loan credit facility is repaid monthly through March 2030. For more information on our debt financings and future repayment schedules, see Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this report. 
 Finance Leases . Our repayments of finance lease obligations were 26,249 and 16,390 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased an aircraft previously classified as a finance lease. The resulting cash outflows were recorded as payments for finance lease obligations. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 15 and 13 aircraft finance leases, respectively. 
 -42- 

Common Stock Repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 755,284 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of 11,493, or 15.22 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 3,307,541 shares of its Common Stock at 16.64 per share. For more information on the stock repurchase program, see Note 9 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this report. 
 Other. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made payments of 3,350 and 2,425 to the TRA holders, respectively. For more information on the payment of the TRA, see Note 8 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this report. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 For a detailed discussion on the nature of the Company's Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Operations in Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 10-K. There have been no material changes to the Company's Off Balance Sheet Arrangements as compared to the 2023 10-K. 
 
 Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
 See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding commitments and contractual obligations. 
 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no recently adopted accounting standards that had a material impact to the Company. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. For more information on our critical accounting policies, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Operations sections within Part II, Item 7 , respectively, in our 2023 10-K. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the 2023 10-K.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks include commodity price risk, specifically with respect to aircraft fuel, as well as interest rate risk. The adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose a potential loss as discussed below. The sensitivity analysis provided does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the information provided below. 
 Aircraft Fuel . Unexpected pricing changes of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, based on our forecasted Aircraft Fuel expense for the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the average aircraft fuel price would increase Aircraft Fuel expense by approximately 203. Aircraft Fuel expense does not include amounts where we are considered the customer's agent for procuring fuel. We had no fuel option and swap contracts in place to hedge the economic risk associated with volatile fuel prices as of September 30, 2024. We currently do not expect to enter into these types of contracts prospectively, although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions. 
 Interest Rates. We have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to the interest expense from our variable-rate debt and our short-term investment securities. A change in market interest rates would impact interest expense under the 119,200 term loan credit facility used to finance the Owned Aircraft Held for Operating Lease. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the September 30, 2024 balance of the term loan would result in a corresponding increase in interest expense of approximately 971 annually. As of the date of this filing, the entire term loan credit facility had been drawn. The Company also maintains a 25,000 Revolving Credit Facility with a variable interest rate that is impacted by market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 24,743 of financing available through the Revolving Credit Facility, as 257 had been pledged to support letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts on the Revolving Credit Facility were outstanding. 
 Our short-term investment securities are primarily comprised of fixed-rate debt investments. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value. The fair market value of our short-term investments with exposure to interest rate risk was 83,280 as of September 30, 2024. The Company limits its investments to investment grade quality securities. Given these factors and that a significant portion of our portfolio is held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures represent controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-Q, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to commercial litigation claims and to administrative and regulatory proceedings and reviews that may be asserted or maintained from time to time.
