 TN-RP is a variable interest entity VIE ), in which both the Company and TechNexus each have a variable interest. The Company s equity interest, which entitles the Company to a share of future distributions from TN-RP, represents a variable interest. The Company has significant influence due to its Class A-RP unit ownership interest, non-majority seats on the TN-RP advisory board and certain protective rights, and therefore the Company s investment in TN-RP is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and reported as a component of Equity investments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Similarly, the Company holds an additional investment that is also a VIE over which the Company has significant influence. This is also reported as a component of Equity investments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Maximum exposure to loss

 Cash equivalents represent investments in short-term money market instruments that are direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury and/or repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury obligations. These investments are reported as a component of Cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Deferred compensation plan assets accounted for at fair value are investments in securities (primarily mutual funds) traded in an active market held for the benefit of certain employees of the Company as part of a deferred compensation plan. Additional plan investments in corporate-owned life insurance are recorded at their cash surrender value, not fair value, and therefore are not included above. 
 
 Equity investments represent stock investments that are publicly traded in an active market and are reported within Other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates. 
 
 The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the applicable observable yield curves.

 As discussed in Note 13 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, the Company is a party to a term loan term loan agreement, which consists of both a U.S. dollar-denominated term loan tranche USD term loan and a Euro-denominated term loan tranche Euro term loan and a asset-based credit facility ABL ). 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, the outstanding USD term loan balance of was subject to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR )-based rate totaling . The total interest rate on the October 31, 2024 outstanding Euro term loan tranche balance of was . The Senior Unsecured Notes were issued on October 14, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of and bear fixed interest at a rate of . 
 
 As of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, there were outstanding ABL borrowings. Availability under the ABL agreement is subject to a borrowing base based on a percentage of applicable eligible receivables and eligible inventory, and based on October 31, 2024 eligible receivables and eligible inventory balances and net of amounts drawn, if any, totaled approximately . 
 
 For the three-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, interest expense on total long-term debt was and , respectively. These interest expense amounts include the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs of and , for the three-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 respectively. 
 
 The fair value of the Company s term loan debt at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 was and , respectively. The fair value of the Company s Senior Unsecured Notes at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 was and , respectively. The fair value of all other debt held by the Company approximates carrying value.

 . This rate was favorably impacted by certain foreign tax rate differences which include certain interest income not subject to corporate income tax. The favorable foreign rate differential was partially offset by additional tax expense related to the jurisdictional mix of earnings between foreign and domestic operations during the three months ended October 31, 2024. The overall effective income tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was , which was favorably impacted by certain foreign tax rate differences, which include certain interest income not subject to corporate income tax. The favorable foreign rate differential was partially offset by tax expense from the vesting of share-based compensation awards during the three months ended October 31, 2023. 
 
 Within the next 12 months, the Company does not anticipate any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2024.

 and as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. The commitment term is generally up to . 
 
 The Company accounts for the guarantee under repurchase agreements of independent dealers financing by deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the guarantee at inception. This estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by the Company s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting its independent dealers. This deferred amount is included in the repurchase and guarantee reserve balances of and as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively, which are included in Other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Losses incurred related to repurchase agreements that were settled during the three months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 were not material. Based on current market conditions and other conditions affecting its independent dealers, the Company believes that any future losses under these agreements will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 The Company is also involved in certain litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of its business, most of which is based upon state lemon laws, warranty claims and vehicle accidents (for which the Company carries insurance above a specified self-insured retention or deductible amount). The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. There is significant judgment required in assessing both the probability of an adverse outcome and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. Based on current conditions, and in management s opinion, the ultimate disposition of any current legal proceedings or claims against the Company will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Litigation is, however, inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from such litigation could have a material effect on the operating results of a particular reporting period. 
 
 As discussed in Note 15 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, the Company is involved in a product recall and was part of an advertising-related investigation by certain German-based authorities that has been fully resolved. There were no significant developments related to these matters during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. There was impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 related to these matters, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recognized of income within selling, general and administrative expenses due to reducing previously recorded reserves related to these matters.

 As of October 31, 2024, the Company has a receivable in the amount of related to estimated damages incurred for which we deem the recovery of such losses from our insurance carriers to be probable. Total estimated losses are and are primarily attributed to the write-off of motorized chassis. The Company has received initial insurance proceeds related to this event totaling through the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024. This insurance recovery receivable is included in Accounts receivable, other, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we believe recovery will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date. 
 
 Given the expectation of recovery from insurance, the impact on our consolidated income before income taxes during fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 related to the losses incurred on the weather damages noted above was not material. As of the date of this report, the Company is still in the process of fully assessing damages and submitting relevant insurance claim information. 
 
 Although our insurance covers business interruption, the Company did not recognize recovery for business interruption during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024 and will do so at the time of final settlement or when nonrefundable cash advances are made in subsequent periods.

Executive Overview 
 
 We were founded in 1980 and have grown to become the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles RVs in the world based on units sold and revenue. We are also the largest manufacturer of RVs in North America, and one of the largest manufacturers of RVs in Europe. In North America, according to Statistical Surveys, Inc. Stat Surveys ), for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, THOR s current combined U.S. and Canadian market share based on units sold was approximately 39.6 for travel trailers and fifth wheels combined and approximately 47.5 for motorhomes. In Europe, according to the European Caravan Federation ECF ), our European market share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 based on units sold was approximately 25.1 for motorcaravans and campervans combined and approximately 18.3 for caravans. 
 
 Industry Outlook North America 
 
 The Company monitors industry conditions in the North American RV market using a number of resources including its own performance tracking and modeling. The Company also considers monthly wholesale shipment data as reported by the RV Industry Association RVIA ), which is typically issued on a one-month lag and represents manufacturers North American RV production and delivery to dealers. In addition, we monitor monthly North American retail sales trends as reported by Stat Surveys, whose data is typically issued on a month-and-a-half lag. The Company believes that monthly RV retail sales data is important as consumer purchases impact future dealer orders and ultimately our production and net sales. 
 
 North American RV independent dealer inventory of our North American RV products as of October 31, 2024 decreased 10.5 to approximately 75,000 units, compared to approximately 83,800 units as of October 31, 2023. As of October 31, 2024, we believe North American dealer inventory levels for most products are generally at, or slightly higher than, the levels that dealers are comfortable stocking heading into the winter months given the current retail sales levels and associated carrying costs. We believe dealers will continue to closely evaluate the unit stocking levels that they will elect to carry in future periods, which may be less than historical unit stocking levels, due to a combination of factors such as slower retail activity, higher RV wholesale prices as well as current interest rates and other carrying costs. 

21 

THOR s North American RV backlog as of October 31, 2024 decreased 137,153, or 6.7 , to 1,896,192 compared to 2,033,345 as of October 31, 2023. The decrease in backlog is primarily a result of a reduction in recent orders from dealers, mainly for motorized products, which we believe is due to lower retail sales and dealer concerns over current interest costs and other carrying costs compared to the prior-year period. 
 
 North American Industry Wholesale Statistics 
 
 Key wholesale statistics for the North American RV industry, as reported by RVIA for the periods indicated, are as follows: 
 
 U.S. and Canada Wholesale Unit Shipments Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) Change North American Towable units 229,491 202,361 27,130 13.4 North American Motorized units 26,921 35,760 (8,839) (24.7) Total 256,412 238,121 18,291 7.7 
 
 In September 2024, RVIA issued a revised forecast for calendar year 2024 North American wholesale unit shipments. Under a most likely scenario, towable and motorized unit shipments are projected to increase to approximately 289,800 units and 34,300 units, respectively, for an annual total of approximately 324,100 units, up 3.5 from the 2023 calendar year wholesale shipments. According to RVIA, the most likely forecast for calendar year 2024 could range from a lower estimate of approximately 311,600 total units to an upper estimate of approximately 336,600 total units. 
 
 As part of their September 2024 forecast, RVIA also issued a downward revision of their initial June 2024 estimates for calendar year 2025 wholesale unit shipments. In the most likely scenario, towable and motorized unit shipments are projected to increase to an approximated annual total of 346,100 units, or 6.8 higher than the most likely scenario for calendar year 2024 wholesale shipments. This calendar year 2025 most likely forecast could range from a lower estimate of approximately 329,900 total units to an upper estimate of approximately 362,300 total units. RVIA stated the primary reason for the downward revision of their calendar year 2025 wholesale unit shipments is the unfavorable impact of persistently elevated interest rates on retail sales causing a delay in the anticipated recovery of wholesale unit shipments. The RVIA is expected to release further revisions to their forecasts for calendar years 2024 and 2025 in early December 2024, which will take into consideration current economic conditions and recent wholesale shipment and retail registration data.

 While we anticipate that near-term demand will be influenced by many factors, including consumer confidence and the level of consumer spending on discretionary products, we believe future retail demand over the longer term will exceed historical, pre-pandemic levels. We believe interest in the RV lifestyle remains high as consumers continue to value the perceived benefits offered by the RV lifestyle, which provides people with the ability to connect with loved ones and nature as well as the potential to get away for short, frequent breaks or longer adventures.

 North American Outlook 
 
 Historically, RV industry sales have been impacted by a number of economic conditions faced by RV dealers, and ultimately retail consumers, such as the rate of unemployment, the rate of inflation, the level of consumer confidence, the disposable income of consumers, interest rates, credit availability, the health of the housing market, tax rates and fuel availability and prices. We believe these factors will continue to affect retail sales in fiscal 2025. In addition, due to inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and other factors, we believe that RV dealers will be continuously reevaluating their desired stocking levels, which may result in lower than historical dealer inventory stocking levels on a unit basis. It is difficult to predict the extent to which any or all of these factors will impact the RV industry or our business in a particular future period, however, we currently believe the remainder of calendar year 2024 will continue to be negatively impacted by these factors. 

23 

Despite the near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about future growth in North American retail sales in the long term, as there are many factors driving product interest. Surveys conducted by THOR, RVIA and others show that Americans of all generations love the freedom of the outdoors and the enrichment that comes with living an active lifestyle. RVs allow people to be in control of their travel experiences, going where they want, when they want and with the people they want. The RV units we design, produce and sell allow people to spend time outdoors pursuing their favorite activities, creating cherished moments and deeply connecting with family and friends. Based on the ongoing value consumers place on these factors, we expect to see long-term growth in the North American RV industry. The growth in industry-wide RV sales during late calendar year 2020 through early calendar year 2023 resulted in exposing a wider range of consumers to the RV lifestyle. As a result, we believe many of those who have been recently exposed to the industry for the first time will become future owners, and that those who became first-time owners since the onset of the pandemic will become long-term RVers, resulting in future repeat and upgrade sales opportunities. We also believe many consumers are likely to continue opting for fewer vacations via air travel, cruise ships and hotels, while preferring vacations that RVs are uniquely positioned to provide, allowing consumers the ability to explore or unwind, often close to home. In addition, we believe that the availability of camping and RV parking facilities will be an important factor in the future growth of the industry and view both the significant recent investments and the future committed investments by campground owners, states and the federal government in camping facilities and accessibility to state and federal parks and forests to be positive long-term factors. 
 
 Economic and industry-wide factors that have historically affected, and which we believe will continue to affect, our operating results include the costs of commodities, the availability of critical supply components and labor costs incurred in the production of our products. Material and labor costs are the primary factors determining our cost of products sold, and any future increases in raw material or labor costs will impact our profit margins negatively if we are unable to offset those cost increases through a combination of product recontenting, material sourcing strategies, efficiency improvements or raising the selling prices for our products by corresponding amounts. Historically, we have generally been able to offset net cost increases over time through these measures. 
 
 It is extremely difficult to predict when or whether future supply chain issues related to chassis or other components used in the production of RVs will arise. Modifying available chassis for certain motorized products to use for other products is not a viable alternative, particularly in the short term, due to engineering requirements. Uncertainties related to changing state and federal emission standards may also negatively impact the availability of chassis used in our production of certain North American motorized RVs and could also impact consumer buying patterns. The North American recreational vehicle industry has, from time to time in the past, experienced shortages of chassis for various reasons, including component shortages, production delays or other production issues and work stoppages at the chassis manufacturers. 
 
 While the North American RV industry has at times faced supply shortages or delivery delays of other, non-chassis raw material components, the supply chain is currently able to support our demand. If any of these factors were to impact our suppliers ability to fully supply our needs for key components, our costs of such components and our production output could be adversely affected. 
 
 Industry Outlook Europe 
 
 The Company monitors industry conditions in the European RV market using a number of resources including its own performance tracking and modeling. The Company also considers retail trends in the European RV market as reported by the European Caravan Federation ECF and its members. On a monthly basis, the Company receives OEM-specific reports for most of the individual member countries that make up the ECF through the Caravaning Industrie Verband e.V. CIVD ). The timing of these reports may vary, but typically they are issued on a one-to-two-month lag. While most countries provide OEM-specific information, the United Kingdom, which made up 17.9 and 10.2 of the caravan and motorcaravan (including campervans) European market for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, does not provide OEM-specific information. Industry wholesale shipment data for the European RV market is not available. 
 
 Within Europe, over 90 of our sales are made to dealers within 10 different European countries. The market conditions, as well as the operating status of our independent dealers within each country, vary based on the various local economic and other conditions. It is inherently difficult to generalize about the operating conditions within the entire European region. 
 
 Independent dealer inventory of our European RV products as of October 31, 2024 increased 16.0 to approximately 25,400 units as compared to approximately 21,900 units as of October 31, 2023. Independent RV dealer inventory levels of our European products are generally in line with historic seasonal levels in both Germany, which accounts for approximately 60 of our European product sales, and in the other various countries we serve. 

24 

THOR s European Recreational Vehicle backlog as of October 31, 2024 decreased 1,287,535, or 38.7 , to 2,043,636 compared to 3,331,171 as of October 31, 2023, primarily due to improved chassis supply availability as chassis constraints in the prior year resulted in significantly elevated backlogs as of October 31, 2023.

 European Outlook 
 
 Our European operations offer a full lineup of leisure vehicles including caravans and motorized products including urban vehicles, campervans and small-to-large motorcaravans. Our product offerings are not limited to vehicles only but also include accessories and services, including vehicle rentals. We address European retail customers through a sophisticated brand management approach based on consumer segmentation according to target group, core values and emotions. With the help of data-based and digital marketing, we intend to continue expanding our retail customer reach to new and younger consumer segments. 

25 

The impact of current macroeconomic factors on our business, including inflation and interest rates, supply chain constraints, environmental and sustainability regulations and geopolitical events, is uncertain. Our outlook for future European RV retail sales depends upon the various economic and regulatory conditions in the respective countries in which we sell our products, and on our ability to manage through supply chain issues that have, and are expected to continue to, impact the efficiency of our production of our motorized products in the near term. End-customer demand for RVs depends strongly on consumer confidence. Factors such as the rate of unemployment, the rate of inflation, private consumption and investments, the level of disposable income of consumers, interest rates, the health of the housing market, tax rates and regulatory restrictions and, since the pandemic, travel safety considerations all influence retail sales. Our long-term outlook for future growth in European RV retail sales remains positive as more people discover RVs as a way to support their lifestyle in search of independence and individuality, as well as using the RV as a multi-purpose vehicle to escape urban life and explore outdoor activities and nature. 
 
 We and our independent European dealers market our European recreational vehicles through multiple avenues including at numerous RV fairs at the country and regional levels which occur throughout the calendar year. These fairs have historically been well-attended events that allow retail consumers the ability to see the newest products, features and designs and to talk with product experts in addition to being able to purchase or order an RV. The most recent 2024 Caravan Salon show in late August 2024 experienced near-record attendance, demonstrating the high level of interest in the RV lifestyle despite the current macroeconomic uncertainties facing many consumers. In addition to our attendance at various strategic trade fairs, we have and will continue to strengthen and expand our digital activities to reach high potential target groups, generate leads and steer customers directly to dealerships. With approximately 1,100 active independent dealers in Germany and throughout Europe with whom we do business, we believe our European brands have one of the strongest and most professionally structured dealer and service networks in Europe. 
 
 Economic or industry-wide factors affecting our European RV operating results include the availability and costs of commodities and component parts and the labor used in the manufacture of our products. Material and labor costs are the primary factors determining our cost of products sold and any future increases in these costs will impact our profit margins negatively if we are unable to offset those cost increases through a combination of product recontenting, material sourcing strategies, efficiency improvements or raising the selling prices for our products by corresponding amounts. 
 
 While overall chassis supply has improved, disruption in the sequence of chassis supply has in the past, and could in the future, inhibit our ability to efficiently and consistently maintain our planned production levels. Uncertainties related to changing emission standards may also negatively impact the availability of chassis used in our production of certain European motorized RVs and could also impact consumer buying patterns. 
 
 Where possible, to minimize the future impact of supply chain constraints, we have identified a second-source supplier base for certain component parts; however, the engineering requirements associated with an alternate component part, particularly the chassis on which our various units are built, limit the impact of these alternative suppliers on reducing any near-term supply constraints. 
 
 In addition to potential future material supply constraints, labor shortages may also impact our European operations. Currently, we are experiencing a shortage of available skilled workers at certain of our production facilities due to near full employment rates in the European regions where our manufacturing sites are located.

 CONSOLIDATED 
 
 Consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 decreased 357,975, or 14.3 , compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. Approximately 28.2 of the Company s consolidated net sales for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 were transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company s most material exchange rate exposure is sales in Euros. The 357,975 decrease in consolidated net sales includes an increase of 17,897 from the change in currency exchange rates between the two periods. To determine this impact, net sales transacted in currencies other than U.S. dollars have been translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates that were in effect during the comparative periods. 
 
 Consolidated gross profit for the three months ended October 31, 2024 decreased 76,490, or 21.4 , compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. Consolidated gross profit was 13.1 of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 14.3 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The decreases in consolidated gross profit and the consolidated gross profit percentage were both primarily due to the impact of the decrease in consolidated net sales in the current-year quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 increased 22,301, or 10.2 , compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to the increase in certain Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed below, partially offset by the impact of the 14.3 decrease in consolidated net sales and the decrease in consolidated income before income taxes, which resulted in lower related sales commissions and other incentive compensation. 
 
 The increase in income included in Other income (expense), net of 17,562 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 is primarily due to the favorable changes in Corporate other income and expenses as discussed below. 
 
 The decrease of 73,738, or 101.6 , in income before income taxes to a loss before income taxes for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to income before taxes for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily driven by the decrease in consolidated net sales. 

28 

The overall effective income tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 24.5 compared with 24.2 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The primary reason for the increase relates to the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income between foreign and domestic operations between the comparable periods. 
 
 Additional information concerning the changes in net sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and income before income taxes are addressed below and in the segment reporting that follows. 
 
 Corporate costs included in consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 28,179 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. This increase includes an increase in compensation costs of 13,868, primarily due to employee separation costs related to certain headcount reductions in the current quarter, and an increase in deferred compensation expense of 11,124 due to market value fluctuations between the two periods, which was effectively offset by the increase in other income related to the deferred compensation plan assets noted below. In addition, the prior-year quarter included 10,000 of income from adjustments made related to the matters discussed in Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in certain dealer promotional costs of 3,150, a decrease in incentive compensation of 1,505 due to the decrease in income before income taxes compared to the prior-year quarter, and a decrease of 2,700 in costs related to our standby repurchase obligation reserve due to decreases in both dealer inventory levels and repurchase activity compared to the prior-year quarter. 
 
 Net expense from Corporate interest and other income and expenses decreased 17,132 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. Net interest expense decreased 4,785 primarily due to lower debt interest expense as a result of lower average outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates. This decrease in net expense also included the favorable changes of 11,206 in the fair value of the Company s deferred compensation plan assets and 2,483 in the fair value of certain other equity investments, both due to market value fluctuations between the two periods, and the recorded operating results of our equity investments as discussed in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements improved by 3,681 in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. These favorable changes were partially offset by an unfavorable change of 5,574 in the non-cash foreign currency gains on certain Euro-denominated loans.

 Change 
 North American Towable Travel Trailers (15.2) Fifth Wheels 7.5 Total North American Towable (11.7) 
 
 The decrease in total North American Towable net sales of 4.9 compared to the prior-year quarter resulted from a 6.8 increase in unit shipments and an 11.7 decrease in the overall net price per unit due to the combined impact of changes in product mix and price. The increase in unit shipments is primarily due to the higher demand for the lower-cost travel trailers units, which increased 12.5 over the prior-year quarter. According to statistics published by RVIA, for the three months ended October 31, 2024, combined North American travel trailer and fifth wheel wholesale unit shipments increased 9.2 compared to the same period last year. According to the most recently published statistics from Stat Surveys, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our North American market share for travel trailers and fifth wheels combined was 38.6 and 41.1 , respectively. Comparisons of Company shipments to industry shipments on a quarterly basis would not necessarily be indicative of the results expected for a full fiscal year. 
 
 The decrease in the overall net price per unit within the travel trailer product line of 15.2 was primarily due to a change in product mix trending toward more moderately-priced units as compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase in overall net price per unit within the fifth wheel product line of 7.5 was primarily due to product mix changes and lower sales discounting as compared to the prior-year quarter. 
 
 North American Towable cost of products sold decreased 41,102 to 786,341, or 87.5 of North American Towable net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 827,443, or 87.5 of North American Towable net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The changes in material, labor, freight-out and warranty costs comprised 43,990 of the 41,102 decrease in cost of products sold. Material, labor, freight-out and warranty costs as a combined percentage of North American Towable net sales decreased slightly to 79.2 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 80.0 for the three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the material cost percentage from the combined net favorable impacts of lower sales discounting and cost-saving initiatives. 

30 

Total manufacturing overhead increased 2,888, primarily due to higher employee self-insurance costs, and increased as a percentage of North American Towable net sales from 7.5 to 8.3 as the decreased net sales levels resulted in higher overhead costs per unit sold. 
 
 The decrease in North American Towable gross profit of 5,574 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 was driven by the decrease in North American Towable net sales while it remained the same as a percentage of North American Towable net sales. 
 
 North American Towable selling, general and administrative expenses increased slightly by 487, or 0.8 , for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, and there were no changes of significance within its major cost components. The increase in the overall selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of North American Towable net sales is primarily due to the decrease in North American Towable net sales increasing the employee compensation and benefits cost percentage and certain other costs percentages that are generally more fixed costs in nature. 
 
 The decrease in North American Towable income before income taxes of 2,428 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 is primarily due to the decrease in North American Towable net sales, while North American Towable income before income taxes as a percentage of North American Towable net sales was unchanged.

 Change 
 North American Motorized Class A 5.3 Class C 3.0 Class B 3.0 Total North American Motorized 4.0 
 
 The decrease in total North American Motorized net sales of 29.0 compared to the prior-year quarter resulted from a 33.0 decrease in unit shipments and a 4.0 increase in the overall net price per unit due to the impact of changes in product mix and price. The decrease in unit shipments is primarily due to a softening in current dealer and consumer demand in comparison with the demand in the prior-year quarter. According to statistics published by RVIA, for the three months ended October 31, 2024, combined North American motorhome wholesale unit shipments decreased 27.2 compared to the same period last year. According to the most recently published statistics from Stat Surveys, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our North American market share for motorhomes was 47.9 and 49.0 , respectively. Comparisons of Company shipments to industry shipments on a quarterly basis would not necessarily be indicative of the results expected for a full fiscal year. 
 
 The increases in the overall net price per unit within the Class A product line of 5.3 , the Class C product line of 3.0 and the Class B product line of 3.0 were all primarily due to favorable product mix changes since the prior-year quarter, with the Class A and Class B product lines benefiting from a higher concentration of sales of the generally higher-priced Tiffin Group product lines in the current-year period, as well as selective net selling price increases. 

32 

North American Motorized cost of products sold decreased 169,286 to 462,481, or 91.5 of North American Motorized net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 631,767, or 88.8 of North American Motorized net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The changes in material, labor, freight-out and warranty costs comprised 162,856 of the 169,286 decrease primarily due to the decreased net sales volume. Material, labor, freight-out and warranty costs as a combined percentage of North American Motorized net sales increased to 84.8 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 83.2 for the three months ended October 31, 2023, with the increase primarily due to an increase in the material cost percentage primarily as a result of increased sales discounting and increased chassis costs. The material cost percentage increase was partially offset by a decrease in the warranty cost percentage. 
 
 Total manufacturing overhead decreased 6,430 in correlation with the net sales decrease, but increased as a percentage of North American Motorized net sales from 5.6 to 6.7 as the decrease in net sales levels resulted in higher overhead costs per unit sold. 
 
 The decrease in North American Motorized gross profit of 36,665 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 was driven by the decrease in North American Motorized net sales, and the decrease in the gross profit percentage is due to the increase in the cost of products sold percentage noted above. 
 
 The decrease in North American Motorized selling, general and administrative expenses of 8,108 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to the decreases in North American Motorized net sales and income before income taxes, which caused related commissions, incentive and other compensation to decrease by 5,830. Sales-related travel, advertising and promotional costs also decreased 1,398. The increase in the overall selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of North American Motorized net sales is primarily due to the decrease in North American Motorized net sales. 
 
 The decrease in North American Motorized income before income taxes of 27,971 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in North American Motorized net sales, and the primary reasons for the decrease in percentage were the increases in the cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense percentages noted above.

 The decrease in total European Recreational Vehicle net sales of 14.6 compared to the prior-year quarter resulted from a 27.4 decrease in unit shipments and a 12.8 increase in the overall net price per unit due to the total impact of changes in foreign currency, product mix and price. The decrease in unit shipments is primarily due to a softening in current dealer and consumer demand compared to the prior-year quarter, which also included independent dealer restocking of their low unit levels while current stocking levels are more in line with historical seasonal levels. The decrease in total European Recreational Vehicle net sales of 103,298 includes an increase of 17,897, or 2.5 netted in the 14.6 decrease, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates compared to the prior-year period. 
 
 The overall net price per unit increase of 12.8 includes a 2.5 increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and a 10.3 increase due to the combined impact of product mix and price, primarily due to the higher concentration of Motorcaravan sales in the current-year quarter due to improved chassis supply and fewer other component constraints compared to the prior-year quarter. 
 
 The constant-currency decreases in the overall net price per unit within the Motorcaravan product line of 1.5 and the Caravan product line of 2.2 were primarily due to the impact of product mix changes and increased sales discounting. The constant-currency increase in the overall net price per unit within the Campervan product line of 8.7 is primarily due to the current-year quarter included a higher concentration of Campervan units with a purchased chassis that is included in the unit sales price as opposed to units with a customer-supplied chassis that is not included in the unit sales price.

European Recreational Vehicle cost of products sold decreased 73,118 to 512,255, or 84.7 of European Recreational Vehicle net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 585,373, or 82.7 of European Recreational Vehicle net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The changes in material, labor, freight-out and warranty costs comprised 73,937 of the 73,118 decrease primarily due to the decreased net sales volume. Material, labor, freight-out and warranty costs as a combined percentage of European Recreational Vehicle net sales was flat at 71.4 for both the three months ended October 31, 2024 and the three months ended October 31, 2023, as decreases in both the direct labor and warranty cost percentages were offset by an increase in the material cost percentage that was primarily due to increased sales discounting. 
 
 Total manufacturing overhead increased slightly by 819, primarily due to increased depreciation expense being mostly offset by lower employee costs, but increased as a percentage of European Recreational Vehicle net sales from 11.3 to 13.3 primarily due to the sales decrease resulting in higher overhead costs per unit sold. 
 
 The decrease in European Recreational Vehicle gross profit of 30,180 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in European Recreational Vehicle net sales, and the decrease in the gross profit percentage is due to the increase in the cost of products sold percentage noted above. 
 
 European Recreational Vehicle selling, general and administrative expenses increased just 38 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 and there were no changes of significance within its major cost components. The increase in the overall selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of European Recreational Vehicle net sales is due to the decrease in European Recreational Vehicle net sales primarily increasing the employee compensation and benefits and the advertising and promotions cost percentages, which are generally more fixed costs in nature. 
 
 The decrease in European Recreational Vehicle income before income taxes of 27,590 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in European Recreational Vehicle net sales, and the primary reasons for the decrease in percentage were the increases in both the cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense percentages noted above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had 445,222 in cash and cash equivalents, of which 292,653 was held in the U.S. and the equivalent of 152,569, predominantly in Euros, was held in Europe, compared to 501,316 on July 31, 2024, of which 373,031 was held in the U.S. and the equivalent of 128,285, predominantly in Euros, was held in Europe. Cash and cash equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the United States. The components of the 56,094 decrease in cash and cash equivalents are described in more detail below, but the decrease was primarily attributable to cash provided by operations of 30,740 less cash used in financing activities of 64,620 and cash used in investing activities of 25,342. 
 
 Net working capital at October 31, 2024 was 1,051,459 compared to 1,083,005 at July 31, 2024. Capital expenditures of 25,273 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 were made primarily for production building additions and improvements and replacing machinery and equipment used in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 We strive to maintain adequate cash balances to ensure we have sufficient resources to respond to opportunities and changing business conditions. In addition, the unused availability under our revolving asset-based credit facility is generally available to the Company for general operating purposes and approximated 865,000 at October 31, 2024. We believe our on-hand cash and cash equivalents and funds generated from operations, along with funds available under the revolving asset-based credit facility, will be sufficient to fund expected operational requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Our priorities for the use of current and future available cash generated from operations remain consistent with our history, and include reducing our indebtedness, maintaining and, over time, growing our dividend payments and funding our growth, both organically and, opportunistically, through acquisitions. We may also consider strategic and opportunistic repurchases of shares of THOR stock under the share repurchase authorizations as discussed in Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and special dividends based upon market and business conditions and excess cash availability, subject to potential customary limits and restrictions pursuant to our credit facilities, applicable legal limitations and determination by the Company's Board of Directors ("Board"). We believe our on-hand cash and cash equivalents and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund expected cash dividend payments and share repurchases for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Our current estimate of committed and internally approved capital spend for the remainder of fiscal 2025 is approximately 200,000, primarily for certain building projects and certain automation projects, as well as replacing and upgrading machinery, equipment and other assets throughout our facilities to be used in the ordinary course of business. We anticipate approximately two-thirds will be in North America and one-third in Europe, and that these expenditures will be funded by cash provided by our operating activities. 
 
 Our Board currently intends to continue regular quarterly cash dividend payments in the future. As is customary under credit facilities, certain actions, including our ability to pay dividends, are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions prior to payment. The conditions for the payment of dividends under the existing debt facilities include a minimum level of adjusted excess cash availability and a fixed charge coverage ratio test, both as defined in the credit agreements. The declaration of future dividends and the establishment of the per share amounts, record dates and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the determination of the Board, and will be dependent upon future earnings, cash flows and other factors, in addition to compliance with any then-existing financing facilities. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 30,740 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 59,668 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. 
 
 For the three months ended October 31, 2024, net income adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation) provided 76,854 of operating cash. The change in net working capital resulted in the use of 46,114 of operating cash during that period, primarily due to the decreases in certain accrued liabilities as the impacts of the changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable mostly offset each other. 
 
 For the three months ended October 31, 2023, net income adjusted for non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation) provided 138,101 of operating cash. The change in net working capital resulted in the use of 78,433 of operating cash during that period, primarily due to an increase in RV finished goods inventory. 

36 

Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 25,342, primarily due to capital expenditures of 25,273. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was 51,062, primarily due to capital expenditures of 38,211. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 64,620, primarily for payments on the term-loan credit facilities of 60,000. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Board approved and declared the payment of a regular quarterly dividend of 0.50 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, but this dividend, totaling 26,551, was not paid until the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was 19,153, which included borrowings of 53,449 on the asset-based credit facility and payments of 51,925 on the asset-based credit facility, in addition to treasury share purchases of 30,037. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Board approved and declared the payment of a regular quarterly dividend of 0.48 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, but this dividend, totaling 25,539, was not paid until the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 The Company increased its previous regular quarterly dividend of 0.48 per share to 0.50 per share in October 2024. In October 2023, the Company increased its previous regular quarterly dividend of 0.45 per share to 0.48 per share.

Accounting Standards 
 
 See Note 1 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 and the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. At times, the Company enters into hedging transactions to mitigate certain of these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the Company's management. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK The Company s principal currency exposures mainly relate to the Euro and British Pound Sterling. The Company periodically uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage certain foreign exchange rate exposure related to anticipated sales transactions in Pounds Sterling with financial instruments whose maturity date, along with the realized gain or loss, occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction. 
 
 The Company also holds 386,397 of debt denominated in Euros at October 31, 2024. A hypothetical 10 change in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate would change our October 31, 2024 debt balance by approximately 38,640. 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK Based on our assumption of the Company s floating-rate debt levels over the next 12 months, a one-percentage-point increase in interest rates (approximately 15.4 of our weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2024) would result in an estimated 5,434 reduction in income before income taxes over a one-year period. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company has carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at attaining the level of reasonable assurance noted above. 
 
 During the quarter ended October 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company is involved in certain litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of its business, most of which is based upon state lemon laws, warranty claims and vehicle accidents (for which the Company carries insurance above a specified self-insured retention or deductible amount). The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. There is significant judgment required in assessing both the probability of an adverse outcome and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management s opinion, the ultimate disposition of any current legal proceedings or claims against the Company will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Litigation is, however, inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from such litigation could have a material effect on the operating results of a particular reporting period. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Before deciding to invest in our Company, in addition to the other information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 
 
 No director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K) during the three months ended October 31, 2024.
