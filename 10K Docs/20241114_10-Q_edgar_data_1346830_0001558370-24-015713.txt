 . The Company has been focused on leading a new treatment paradigm to improve the lives of patients suffering from chronic pruritus. The Company s primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing the Company, developing its lead product and product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of difelikefalin-based product candidates, and raising capital. On June 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a streamlined operating plan exploring strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value after the Company announced its decision to discontinue the clinical program in notalgia paresthetica, or NP, on June 12, 2024. The Company s decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP followed the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. The Company s decision was not related to any safety or medical issues, or negative regulatory feedback related to the Company s NP program. In connection with the streamlined operating plan, the Board of Directors also approved a second reduction in the Company s workforce by approximately , which the Company substantially completed in June 2024 (see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies Restructuring Actions ). In August 2021, the Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval for KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection, or KORSUVA injection, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adults undergoing hemodialysis. Commercial launch of KORSUVA injection began in the United States in April 2022 and the Company began recording the associated profit-sharing revenues in the second quarter of 2022. In April 2022, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to difelikefalin injection under the brand name Kapruvia (difelikefalin), or Kapruvia, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adult hemodialysis patients. The marketing authorization approved Kapruvia for use in all member states of the European Union, or EU, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Kapruvia was also approved in the United Kingdom in April 2022. Commercial launches in Austria, Germany, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Finland, and Norway have commenced. In August 2022, as part of the Access Consortium, difelikefalin injection was approved in Switzerland under the brand name Kapruvia, as well as Singapore and Canada under the brand name KORSUVA. Commercial launch in Switzerland has also commenced. In November 2022, difelikefalin injection was approved in the last Access Consortium country, Australia, under the brand name KORSUVA. Difelikefalin injection was also approved in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia under the brand name KORSUVA in January 2023, May 2023, June 2023, September 2023, and January 2024, respectively. On November 1, 2023, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement, or the HCR Agreement, with HCRX Investments Holdco, L.P. and Healthcare Royalty Partners IV, L.P., or collectively HCR, pursuant to which HCR will receive current and future royalty and milestone payments for Kapruvia and KORSUVA (ex U.S. only) up to certain capped amounts in exchange for certain payments made to the Company (see Note 10, Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement) . In 2018, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with a joint venture between Vifor Pharma Group and Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd., that provides full commercialization rights of Kapruvia, and where applicable KORSUVA, to Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. worldwide (excluding the United States, Japan and South Korea).

The Company also retains the rights to import, distribute, promote, sell and otherwise commercialize the Licensed Product on an exclusive basis outside of the Field either in or outside of the United States. The Vifor International Supply Agreement is accounted for as a customer option that is not a material right because the selling price of the Licensed Product under the Vifor International Supply Agreement is the Company s COGS plus an agreed upon margin, which is commensurate with the COGS plus model that the Company would charge other parties under similar agreements (the standalone selling price) and not at a discount. Therefore, the sale of commercial supply to CSL Vifor is not a performance obligation under Vifor Agreement No. 1 but rather the Vifor International Supply Agreement is a separate agreement from Vifor Agreement No. 1.

 of operating lease cost, or lease expense, was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, consisting of relating to R D lease expense and relating to G A lease expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and relating to R D lease expense and relating to G A lease expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was lease expense recognized on these former lease agreements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 since these agreements terminated in December 2023. Lease New Corporate Headquarters in May 2023 On May 11, 2023, the Company entered into the New Lease for the Company s new principal executive offices. The initial term of the New Lease commenced on November 1, 2023, or the Commencement Date, and will expire on the last day of the calendar month in which occurs the tenth anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date, as defined below, or the Term. In connection with the signing of the New Lease, the Company entered into a standby letter of credit agreement for which serves as a security deposit for the leased office space. This standby letter of credit is secured with restricted cash in a money market account and is included within current assets as of September 30, 2024 (refer to Note 6, Restricted Cash ). The annual fixed rent rate under the New Lease is initially million (considered by the Company to be at market rate as of the signing of the New Lease), which was set to commence on November 1, 2024, or the Rent Commencement Date, and was expected to increase annually thereafter. The Company had expected to begin paying rent in November 2024. The Company is also responsible for the payment of Additional Rent, as defined in the New Lease, including its share of the operating and tax expenses for the building. As a result, the New Lease contains both a lease (the right to use the asset) and a non-lease component (common area maintenance services) which are accounted for separately. The Company allocates the consideration to the lease and non-lease component on a relative standalone price basis. The Company had the the Term under the New Lease for an additional on the same terms and conditions (other than with respect to the annual fixed rent at the annual fair market rental rate, as defined in the New Lease) as set forth in the New Lease. This renewable term was not included as part of the lease term as defined in ASC 842 since it was not reasonably certain that the Company would exercise that option on the Commencement Date. Since the New Lease did not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate equal to the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus per annum subject to a 3-month SOFR floor of , which was based on the rate that the Company could obtain in the market for a fully collateralized loan equal to the term of the New Lease, or .

The initial lease liability of was recorded as the sum of the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. Lease incentives of were not included within lease payments since the timing of these costs being incurred and reimbursed to the Company was uncertain, and they were neither paid nor payable as of July 28, 2023. These lease incentives reduced the lease liability and ROU asset by the costs incurred once the Company actually incurred the costs and the amounts qualified for reimbursement. The reduction to the lease liability was reversed once the Company was reimbursed for the qualified costs. The reduction to the ROU asset would

 was initially recorded as the amount of the lease liability plus prepaid rent paid in May 2023. During the nine months ended September 2024, the Company was reimbursed of qualified reimbursable lease incentives. As a result, there were lease incentives remaining to be reimbursed to the Company as of September 30, 2024. Beginning on July 28, 2023 and during the entire term of the New Lease, interest expense is calculated using the effective interest method and the ROU asset (including prepaid rent) would be amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and both would be recorded as lease expense. As a result, lease expense of and for the New Lease was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of relating to G A lease expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and relating to R D expense and relating to G A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Lease expense of for the New Lease was recorded for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of relating to R D lease expense and relating to G A lease expense. Assignment of New Lease (in September 2024) On September 26, 2024, the Company entered into the Assignment Agreements in which its corporate lease, leasehold improvements, and other property and equipment from its corporate office were transferred to a third party on November 1, 2024. The Company determined that the modified lease agreement on September 26, 2024, or the Modification Date, was a lease with a termination date of November 1, 2024, which did not result in a separate contract. As a result, the Company remeasured the remaining consideration in the Assignment Agreements to include a cash lease payment of and a release payment of (that were both paid in September 2024), as well as a non-cash lease payment of that included the fair value of the leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures that was assigned to the third party on November 1, 2024. The Company reassessed the classification of the Assignment Agreements on the Modification Date and determined that the modified lease continued to be an operating lease. The Company also incurred of initial direct costs for the Assignment Agreements which were included within the ROU asset on September 26, 2024. The Company remeasured the lease liability to be on the Modification Date and adjusted the amount of the ROU asset by the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability. Also on September 26, 2024, the Company made a cash payment of which reduced the lease liability to , which is included within current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet since the termination date is November 1, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the Company analyzed the recorded value of its ROU asset for impairment and determined that the carrying value was not recoverable. As a result, the Company recorded a full impairment charge of on its ROU asset, which was included within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. .

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with: (i) the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; and (ii) our Annual Report. Overview Introduction We are a biopharmaceutical company that has been focused on leading a new treatment paradigm to improve the lives of patients suffering from chronic pruritus. On June 14, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a streamlined operating plan exploring strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value after we announced our decision to discontinue the clinical program in notalgia paresthetica, or NP, on June 12, 2024. Our decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP followed the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. The decision was not related to any safety or medical issues, or negative regulatory feedback related to our NP program. In connection with the streamlined operating plan, our Board of Directors also approved a second reduction in our workforce by approximately 70 , which was substantially completed by June 30, 2024 (see Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies Restructuring Actions , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We also developed an IV formulation of oral difelikefalin, which is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with advanced chronic kidney disease in adults undergoing hemodialysis in the United States, the European Union, or EU, and multiple other countries. The IV formulation is out-licensed worldwide. Corporate History We were incorporated and commenced operations in 2004, and our primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing our company, developing our lead product and product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of difelikefalin-based product candidates and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities, sales of our royalties from ex-U.S. sales of our commercial product, and payments from license agreements. NASDAQ Continued Listing Rules On February 1, 2024, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, notifying us that, for the previous 30 consecutive business day periods prior to the date of the letter, the closing bid price for our common stock was below 1.00. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until July 30, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq s bid price requirement. On July 31, 2024, we received a notice, or the Extension Notice, from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq informing us that Nasdaq granted us an additional 180 calendar days, or until January 27, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), or the Rule. In connection with the Extension Notice, the listing of our common stock was transferred from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, effective as of August 1, 2024. The Extension Notice had no other immediate effect on the listing of the Company s common stock. 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 If at any time before January 27, 2025, the closing bid price of our common stock is at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written confirmation that we have achieved compliance with the Rule. We intend to continue to actively monitor the bid price for our common stock between now and January 27, 2025, and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Rule. These options include, but are not limited to, effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary, to attempt to regain compliance. If we do not regain compliance within the additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. We would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will regain compliance with the Rule or that our common stock will not be delisted from Nasdaq. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain shareholders equity of at least 2.5 million, or the Shareholders Equity Requirement, or the alternative requirements of having a market value of listed securities of 35.0 million or net income from continuing operations of 0.5 million in the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years, or the Alternative Standards. As of September 30, 2024, we had shareholders equity of 0.7 million and therefore are not in compliance with the Shareholders Equity Requirement and, as of September 30, 2024, we did not meet the Alternative Standards. If we continue to not be in compliance or if we fail to meet other Nasdaq continuing listing requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting, and we may become subject to delisting proceedings. We are currently assessing our available options to regain compliance with the Shareholders Equity Requirement. Corporate Update Our stockholders approved, at our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 4, 2024, a series of alternate amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock and corresponding proportionate reduction in the total number of authorized shares of our common stock, where the Board of Directors will have the discretion to select the reverse stock split ratio from within a range between and including one-for-four and one-for-twelve. To date, we have not effected a reverse stock split and corresponding reduction in authorized shares. Any such reverse stock split and corresponding reduction in authorized shares of common stock, and the reverse stock split ratio, will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors at any time prior to our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and the Board of Directors may elect never to do so. On June 7, 2024, we filed the Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, or the Certificate, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware which was approved by our stockholders at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 4, 2024. The Certificate increased the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares. The additional shares of common stock authorized by the Certificate have rights identical to our currently outstanding common stock and any issuance of common stock pursuant to the Certificate would not affect the rights of the holders of our currently outstanding common stock, except for effects incidental to increasing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, such as dilution of the earnings per share and voting rights of current holders of our common stock. Assignment of Our New Lease On September 26, 2024, we entered into a Consent to Lease Assignment and Amendment to Lease with the Landlord and an Assignment and Assumption of Lease Agreement, or the Assignment Agreements, in which our corporate lease, leasehold improvements, and other property and equipment from our corporate office were transferred to a third party on November 1, 2024 (see Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies Assignment of New Lease , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).

 Our Product Portfolio 

Product Indication Status Next Milestone Commercialization Rights KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection/Kapruvia Pruritus CKD - Hemodialysis Approved in the U.S. (08/2021) Approved in EU incl. UK (04/2022) Approved in Japan (09/2023) Other approvals: Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Kuwait, Israel, UAE, Saudi Arabia CSL Vifor (Worldwide excl. Japan and South Korea) ; Maruishi (Japan); CKDP (South Korea) We are party to two collaborations for the commercialization of KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection/Kapruvia with a joint venture between CSL Vifor and Fresenius Medical Care. In this Quarterly Report, unless the context otherwise requires, CSL Vifor refers to CSL Vifor and its affiliated entities, including, where applicable, the joint venture. KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection Our Commercial Stage Product Overview We have out-licensed to CSL Vifor the commercialization of KORSUVA injection/Kapruvia in dialysis patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease, or advanced CKD-aP, worldwide, excluding Japan (licensed to Maruishi/sub-licensee Kissei), and South Korea (licensed to CKDP). On August 23, 2021, KORSUVA injection was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with advanced CKD in adults undergoing hemodialysis. In December 2021, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, or CMS, granted Transition Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment, or TDAPA, to KORSUVA injection in the anti-pruritic functional category. TDAPA went into effect on April 1, 2022 for two years. The commercial launch of KORSUVA injection commenced in April 2022 and we began recording the associated profit-sharing revenues in the second quarter of 2022. On October 27, 2023, CMS published the final CY 2024 rule, which finalized the post-TDAPA add-on payment as proposed in the draft CY 2024 rule. Under the final rule, TDAPA drugs in existing functional categories will receive a post-TDAPA add-on payment set at 65 percent of the total trailing 12-months expenditure levels for the given renal dialysis drug or biological product. The post-TDAPA add-on payment will be applied to all End Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD, Prospective Payment System, or PPS, payments and paid for 3 years, adjusted annually. The add-on payments for KORSUVA injection commenced on April 1, 2024. The unfavorable CMS reimbursement codified in the final CY2024 rule has resulted in a lack of sequential revenues growth for KORSUVA injection since its launch. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 3.0 million, which resulted in our profit share amount of 1.3 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of 4.4 million, which resulted in our profit share amount of 1.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 2.1 million, which included negative net sales reported by CSL Vifor for the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher rebates and chargebacks due to price decreases on KORSUVA injection related to the expiration of TDAPA in April 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 21.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded associated collaborative revenue of 2.1 million and 10.1 million, respectively. However, we have recorded an expense in other general and administrative, or G A, expense for approximately 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the negative profit share amount in the second quarter of 2024. As a result of the final CY 2024 rule, we expect no meaningful revenue contribution from KORSUVA injection following the TDAPA period expiration.

 In April 2022, the European Commission granted a marketing authorization to difelikefalin injection under the brand name Kapruvia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with advanced CKD in adult hemodialysis patients. The marketing authorization approves Kapruvia for use in all member states of the EU, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Difelikefalin injection was also approved in the UK (04/2022) and Switzerland (08/2022) under the brand name Kapruvia as well as Singapore (08/2022), Canada (08/2022), Australia (11/2022), UAE (01/2023), Kuwait (05/2023), Israel (06/2023), Japan (09/2023), and Saudi Arabia (01/2024) under the brand name KORSUVA injection. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded royalty revenue of approximately 167,000 and 415,000, respectively, which represented our royalties on net sales of Kapruvia. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement, or the HCR Agreement, with HCRX Investments Holdco, L.P. and Healthcare Royalty Partners IV, L.P., or collectively HCR, pursuant to which HCR will receive current and future royalty and milestone payments for Kapruvia and KORSUVA (ex-U.S. only) up to certain capped amounts in exchange for certain payments made to us. As a result, there was no royalty revenue recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, we recorded other revenue of approximately 1.3 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, of which approximately 0.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively, related to CSL Vifor royalties to be paid to HCR under this agreement (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement below). We have out-licensed to Maruishi and its sub-licensee Kissei the commercialization of KORSUVA injection in Japan. In September 2023, Maruishi received manufacturing and marketing approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for KORSUVA IV Injection Syringe for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into the HCR Agreement where we sold our future royalties and milestones for KORSUVA in Japan to HCR. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded other revenue of approximately 1.3 million and 2.9 million, respectively, of which approximately 0.8 million and 1.8 million, respectively, related to Maruishi royalties to be paid to HCR under this agreement (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement below). There was no other revenue recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as the HCR Agreement was not entered into until the fourth quarter of 2023. As a result of our sales of the royalties and milestones for KORSUVA/Kapruvia, we expect no meaningful revenue contribution from KORSUVA/Kapruvia royalties and milestones in the foreseeable future. KORSUVA Injection U.S. Commercialization In April 2022, our partner CSL Vifor initiated the commercialization of KORSUVA injection in the United States. The launch was initially driven by independent and mid-size dialysis organizations coupled with product stocking at the wholesaler level. In the third quarter of 2022, large dialysis organizations, or LDOs, came on-line driving a significant quarter-to-quarter increase in order volume from the wholesaler. This stocking at the clinic level, particularly from Fresenius Medical Care, or FMC, resulted in significant subsequent quarterly revenue fluctuations. In the third quarter of 2023, FMC decided to reallocate all remaining clinic level inventory within its network of clinics resulting in limited revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. KORSUVA Injection and Kapruvia Revenue and Other Metrics We generate revenue from our commercial products KORSUVA injection and Kapruvia primarily through our collaboration agreements with CSL Vifor: Collaborative revenue from our share of the profit generated by KORSUVA injection sales in the United States. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded collaborative revenue of 1.3 million and 1.9 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded collaborative revenue of 2.1 million and 10.1 million, respectively. Commercial supply revenue from our sales of commercial product to CSL Vifor, which is subsequently sold to wholesalers. There was no commercial supply revenue recorded during the three months ended September 30,

Table of Contents 
 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded commercial supply revenue of 1.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded commercial supply revenue of 0.6 million and 5.8 million, respectively. Royalty revenue in conjunction with the launch of Kapruvia. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded royalty revenue of approximately 167,000 and 415,000, respectively, which represented royalty payments earned by us. We recorded no royalty revenue in connection with Kapruvia for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of entering the HCR Agreement in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into the HCR Agreement where we sold our current and future royalties and milestone payments for Kapruvia and KORSUVA injection to HCR. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded other revenue of approximately 1.3 million and 2.9 million, respectively, of which approximately 0.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively, related to CSL Vifor royalties to be paid to HCR under this agreement and approximately 0.8 million and 1.8 million, respectively, related to Maruishi royalties to be paid to HCR under this agreement (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement below). We are also eligible for sales-based or regulatory milestone payments, which could be earned in the future in accordance with certain licensing agreements and would be subject to the HCR Agreement for ex-U.S. milestone payments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not record any sales-based or regulatory milestone revenue. Additional metrics that we have reported in the past: Net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States. This amount is the net sales amount recorded by CSL Vifor to reflect shipments of KORSUVA injection vials from CSL Vifor to wholesalers. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 3.0 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 4.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 2.1 million, which included negative net sales reported by CSL Vifor for the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher rebates and chargebacks due to price decreases on KORSUVA injection related to the expiration of TDAPA in April 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 21.5 million. Shipments of KORSUVA injection vials from wholesalers in the United States to the dialysis clinics. 56,976 and 90,828 KORSUVA injection vials were shipped from wholesalers to the dialysis clinics for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 245,568 and 203,400 KORSUVA injection vials were shipped from wholesalers to the dialysis clinics for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the vials shipped to the FMC dialysis centers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a portion was reallocated product by FMC within its network of clinics. 
 Difelikefalin Development in Pruritus Difelikefalin, our selective, predominantly peripherally acting, non-scheduled Kappa opioid receptor agonist, acts on the peripheral neurons responsible for sensing pruritus. Given this unique mechanism of action, difelikefalin is thought to work broadly independent of the origin of itch. To date, we have studied difelikefalin for pruritus associated with systemic, inflammatory, and neuropathic diseases. The IV formulation is approved in the United States, EU and other countries around the world for the treatment of advanced CKD-aP in adults undergoing hemodialysis. We studied the oral formulation at multiple dosage strengths in moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with NP with positive efficacy signals across all completed mono therapy studies. In our NP program, oral difelikefalin was generally well tolerated with all adverse events in difelikefalin-treated patients reported as mild or moderate in severity.

Table of Contents 
 On June 12, 2024, we announced our decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP. Oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. The decision was not related to any safety or medical issues, or negative regulatory feedback related to our NP program. On June 14, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a streamlined operating plan exploring strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value based on the decision to discontinue the NP program. Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement During the fourth quarter of 2023, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Cara Royalty Sub LLC, or Cara Royalty Sub, entered into the HCR Agreement, pursuant to which Cara Royalty Sub sold to HCR certain of its rights to receive future royalties and milestone payments, or the Royalties, due and payable to Cara Royalty Sub (as our assignee) under our agreements with Maruishi and CSL Vifor, collectively the Covered License Agreements , in exchange for up to 40.0 million. We have retained all of our rights, title and interest in, to and under the Covered License Agreements that relate to any non-intravenous formulation of difelikefalin. Under the terms of the HCR Agreement, Cara received an initial payment of 17.5 million less certain transaction costs in November 2023. In December 2023, we received an additional 20.0 million less certain advisory fees, upon satisfying the milestone event for pricing of Kapruvia (difelikefalin) in Germany being approved above a certain threshold amount per dose. The terms of the HCR Agreement also provide for an additional 2.5 million milestone payment to Cara Royalty Sub upon achievement of a 2024 sales milestone of KORSUVA in Japan. As of the date of this filing, we expect to achieve this milestone in the fourth quarter of 2024. The HCR Agreement will automatically expire, and the payment of Royalties to HCR will cease, when HCR has received payments of Royalties equal to two times the aggregate amount of payments made by HCR under the HCR Agreement if achieved on or prior to December 31, 2029, or 2.8 times the aggregate amount of payments made by HCR under the HCR Agreement, if not achieved on or prior to December 31, 2029. In the event of a change of control, Cara Royalty Sub will pay to HCR an amount equal to 2.8 times the aggregate amount of payments made by HCR less the total net amounts paid by Cara Royalty Sub to HCR as of the effective date of control. In certain situations, Cara Royalty Sub would not be obligated to pay the change of control payment to HCR. After the HCR Agreement expires, all rights to receive the Royalties return to Cara Royalty Sub. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 0.7 million and 2.0 million, respectively, was repaid to HCR under the HCR Agreement. Collaboration and License Agreements Agreements with CSL Vifor We are party to two separate license agreements with CSL Vifor. In October 2020, we granted CSL Vifor an exclusive license solely in the United States to use, distribute, offer for sale, promote, sell, and otherwise commercialize KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection for all therapeutic uses relating to the inhibition, prevention or treatment of itch associated with pruritus in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients in the United States. We received an upfront payment of 100.0 million and an additional payment of 50.0 million for the purchase of an aggregate of 2,939,552 shares of our common stock at a price of 17.0094 per share, which represented a premium over a pre-determined average closing price of our common stock. The U.S. regulatory approval of KORSUVA injection in August 2021 triggered an additional 50.0 million equity purchase by CSL Vifor in October 2021, in which we sold an aggregate of 3,282,391 shares of our common stock at a price of 15.23 per share, which represented a 20 premium to the 30-day trailing average price of our common stock. In addition, pursuant to this agreement, we are eligible to receive payments of up to 240.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones. However, based on the limited commercial success of KORSUVA injection, we do not expect to achieve these sales-based milestones.

 Pursuant to the agreement for commercialization of KORSUVA in the United States, we are generally entitled to 60 of the net profits from sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States and CSL Vifor is entitled to 40 of such net profits (excluding sales to Fresenius Medical Center dialysis clinics, compensation for which is governed by a separate agreement), subject to potential temporary adjustment in future years based on certain conditions. Under this agreement, in consideration of CSL Vifor s conduct of the marketing, promotion, selling and distribution of KORSUVA injection in the United States, we pay a marketing and distribution fee to CSL Vifor based on the level of annual net sales. This fee as well as CSL Vifor s cost of goods sold, or COGS, are deducted from net sales in calculating the net profits that are subject to the profit-sharing arrangement under the agreement. Under a separate agreement with CSL Vifor, in May 2018, we granted CSL Vifor a license to seek regulatory approval to commercialize, import, export, use, distribute, offer for sale, promote, sell and otherwise commercialize KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection for all therapeutic uses to prevent, inhibit or treat itch associated with pruritus in hemodialysis and peritoneal-dialysis patients worldwide (excluding the United States, Japan and South Korea). Under the agreement, CSL Vifor also has the right to promote KORSUVA injection in the United States in the dialysis clinics of Fresenius Medical Care North America, or FMCNA, under a profit-sharing arrangement. Upon entry into this agreement, we received a non-refundable, non-creditable 50.0 million upfront payment for the purchase of an aggregate of 1,174,827 shares of our common stock at a price of 17.024 per share, which represented a premium over a pre-determined average closing price of our common stock. As a result of the European Commission s regulatory approval of Kapruvia in April 2022, we received a 15.0 million regulatory milestone payment from CSL Vifor. After U.S. regulatory approval of KORSUVA injection in August 2021, we received a 15.0 million regulatory milestone payment. We are eligible to receive from CSL Vifor commercial milestone payments in the aggregate of up to 440.0 million, all of which milestones are sales related. We are also eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalty payments based on annual net sales, as defined, of KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection in the licensed territories. In the United States, CSL Vifor will promote KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection in the dialysis clinics of FMCNA under a profit-sharing arrangement (subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement) based on net FMCNA clinic sales) and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. is entitled to 50 of such net profits, subject to potential adjustments in a calendar year based on certain conditions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into the HCR Agreement pursuant to which we sold our future royalties and milestone payments under this agreement to HCR (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Maruishi In April 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Maruishi, or the Maruishi Agreement, under which we granted Maruishi an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing difelikefalin in Japan in the acute pain and uremic pruritus fields. Maruishi has a right of first negotiation for any other indications for which we develop difelikefalin and, under certain conditions, Maruishi may substitute another pruritus indication for the uremic pruritus indication originally included in its license from us. Maruishi s right of first negotiation has expired for the indication of chronic pruritus associated with NP. Maruishi is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize difelikefalin in Japan. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize difelikefalin in the United States. In January 2022, Maruishi and its sublicensee Kissei confirmed the primary endpoint was achieved in a Japanese Phase 3 clinical study (double-blind, placebo-controlled period) of difelikefalin injection for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. In the Phase 3 study, 178 patients were administered difelikefalin or placebo for 6 weeks followed by an open-label extension period of difelikefalin administration for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint, change in itch NRS score, and the secondary endpoint, change in itching scores of Shiratori severity criteria, were significantly improved from baseline compared to the placebo group. Difelikefalin was well-tolerated.

 Under the terms of the Maruishi Agreement, we received a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront license fee of 15.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of 10.5 million in clinical development and regulatory milestones (before contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments). In January 2021, we met the milestone criteria, as set forth in the Maruishi Agreement, for Maruishi s first initiation of a Phase 3 trial for uremic pruritus in Japan. As a result, we received the 2.0 million milestone payment 1.9 million after contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments) in May 2021. In September 2022, Maruishi submitted a New Drug Application in Japan for approval of difelikefalin injection for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. In September 2023, Maruishi received manufacturing and marketing approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for KORSUVA IV Injection Syringe for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. In conjunction with the approval, we earned a 1.4 million milestone payment per the terms of the licensing agreement. In November 2023, we entered into an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, supply agreement with Maruishi for difelikefalin. To date, we have received 6.5 million (before contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments) of clinical development and regulatory milestones from Maruishi. We are also eligible to receive a one-time sales milestone of one billion Yen when a certain sales level is attained. We also receive a mid-double-digit percentage of all non-royalty payments received by Maruishi from its sublicensees, if any, and tiered royalties based on net sales, if any, with minimum royalty rates in the low double digits and maximum royalty rates in the low twenties. Maruishi s obligation to pay us royalties continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering such product or the later expiration of any market exclusivity period. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into the HCR Agreement pursuant to which we sold our future royalties and milestone payments under the Maruishi Agreement to HCR (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corporation, or CKDP In April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with CKDP, or the CKDP Agreement, under which we granted CKDP an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing difelikefalin in South Korea. CKDP is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize difelikefalin in South Korea. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize difelikefalin in the United States. Under the terms of the CKDP Agreement, we received a non-refundable and non-creditable 0.6 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of 3.8 million in development and regulatory milestones (before South Korean withholding taxes). To date, we have received 2.3 million (before South Korean withholding tax) of development and regulatory milestones. We are also eligible to receive a mid-double-digit percentage of all non-royalty payments received by CKDP from its sublicensees, if any, and tiered royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens based on net sales, if any. CKDP s obligation to pay us royalties continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering such product or the later expiration of any market exclusivity period. The CKDP Agreement continues until CKDP no longer has any obligation to pay us royalties on any product. Either we or CKDP may terminate the CKDP Agreement for the other party s breach of the CKDP Agreement or bankruptcy. CKDP may terminate the CKDP Agreement if any of the licensed patent rights is invalid, unenforceable, is narrowed in scope or is deemed unpatentable, except as a result of a challenge by CKDP, or a third party commercializes a product containing a compound identical to difelikefalin without infringing any of the licensed patent rights in South Korea. We may terminate the CKDP Agreement if CKDP challenges the licensed patent rights or if a third party in South Korea owns an issued patent that claims difelikefalin and CKDP s sale of products would infringe that patent. In addition, in connection with the CKDP Agreement, CKDP made a 0.4 million equity investment in our company.

 Manufacturing and License Agreements Polypeptide Laboratories S.A., or PPL In July 2021, we entered into an API Commercial Supply Agreement with Polypeptide Laboratories S.A., or PPL, that defines each party s responsibilities with respect to PPL s manufacture and supply of API for the difelikefalin injection product candidate. Under the API Commercial Supply Agreement, PPL shall manufacture API at its facility for sale and supply to us, in the amounts as set forth in purchase orders to be provided by us. We will be required to purchase our requirements of API for each year of the term of the agreement, based on internal forecasts. The API Commercial Supply Agreement will continue until the fifth anniversary of the approval by the FDA of the New Drug Application for KORSUVA injection, unless the API Commercial Supply Agreement is earlier terminated, and will automatically be extended for successive five-year periods unless either party gives notice to the other party of its intention to terminate. Enteris Biopharma, Inc., or Enteris In August 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Enteris Biopharma, Inc. (Enteris), or the Enteris License Agreement. Pursuant to the Enteris License Agreement, Enteris granted to us a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license, including the right to grant sublicenses, under certain proprietary technology and patent rights related to or covering formulations for oral delivery of peptide active pharmaceutical ingredients with functional excipients to enhance permeability and/or solubility, known as Enteris s Peptelligence technology, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products using such technology worldwide, excluding Japan and South Korea. As consideration for the licensed rights under the Enteris License Agreement, we paid an upfront fee equal to 8.0 million, consisting of 4.0 million in cash and 4.0 million in shares of our common stock. We are also obligated, pursuant to the Enteris License Agreement, to pay Enteris (1) milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones and (2) low-single digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. Until the second anniversary of the entry into the Enteris License Agreement, we had the right, but not the obligation, to terminate our obligation to pay any royalties under the Royalty Buyout. We did not exercise our Royalty Buyout right and such right expired in August 2021. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no milestone payments or royalties were paid to Enteris by us in relation to the Enteris License Agreement. The Enteris License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (1) the expiration (or invalidation) of all valid claims in licensed patent rights that cover such product in such country, (2) the end of the calendar quarter in which generic competition (as defined in the Enteris License Agreement) occurs for such product in such country and (3) ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. Either party may terminate the Enteris License Agreement upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach within 60 days (or 30 days in the case of a material breach of a payment obligation). Enteris may terminate the Enteris License Agreement upon 30 days written notice to us if we or any of our affiliates formally challenge the validity of any licensed patent rights or assists a third party in doing so. We may terminate the Enteris License Agreement for any reason or no reason (a) prior to receipt of first regulatory approval for a licensed product in the United States for any indication upon 30 days prior written notice to Enteris or (b) on or after receipt of first regulatory approval for a licensed product in the United States for any indication upon 60 days prior written notice to Enteris. In June 2024, we announced our decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP.

 Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon In July 2019, we entered into a Master Services Agreement, or MSA, with Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon. The MSA governs the general terms under which Patheon, or one of its affiliates, will provide non-exclusive manufacturing services to us for the drug products specified by us from time to time. Pursuant to the MSA, we have agreed to order from Patheon at least a certain percentage of our commercial requirements for a product under a related Product Agreement. Each Product Agreement that we may enter into from time to time will be governed by the terms of the MSA, unless expressly modified in such Product Agreement. The MSA had an initial term ending December 31, 2024, which automatically renewed after the initial term for successive terms of two years until December 31, 2026. Either party may terminate the MSA or a Product Agreement upon written notice if the other party (1) has failed to remedy a material breach within a specified time or (2) is declared insolvent or bankrupt, voluntarily files a petition of bankruptcy or assigns such agreement for the benefit of creditors. We may terminate a Product Agreement (a) upon 90 days prior written notice if any governmental agency takes any action that prevents us from selling the relevant product in the relevant territory, (b) upon six months prior written notice if we do not intend to order manufacturing services due to a product s discontinuance in the market, or (c) upon 90 days prior written notice if we determine that the manufacture or supply of a product likely infringes third-party rights. Patheon may terminate the MSA or a Product Agreement (i) upon six months prior written notice if we assign such agreement to an assignee that is unacceptable to Patheon for certain reasons, or (ii) upon 30 days prior written notice if, after the first year of commercial sales, we forecast zero volume for 12 months. The MSA contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Patheon of certain limited license rights to our intellectual property in connection with Patheon s performance of the services under the MSA, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions. Also in July 2019, we entered into two related Product Agreements under the MSA, one with each of Patheon and Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC, or Patheon Greenville, to govern the terms and conditions of the manufacture of commercial supplies of difelikefalin injection, our lead product candidate. Pursuant to the Product Agreements, Patheon and Patheon Greenville will manufacture commercial supplies of difelikefalin injection at the Monza, Italy and Greenville, North Carolina manufacturing sites, respectively, from API supplied by us. Patheon and Patheon Greenville will be responsible for supplying the other required raw materials and packaging components, and will also provide supportive manufacturing services such as quality control testing for raw materials, packaging components and finished product. In December 2023, we entered into an agreement with Patheon to reimburse Patheon approximately 1.7 million for forecasted manufacturing commitments that are no longer needed due to the reduced demand expectations of KORSUVA in the United States, all of which had been paid as of September 30, 2024. Components of Operating Results The following discussion sets forth certain components of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as well as factors that impact those items. Revenue To date, we have generated revenue primarily from (1) collaborative revenue from our share of the profit generated by KORSUVA injection sales in the United States; (2) commercial supply revenue from our sales of commercial product to CSL Vifor, which is subsequently sold to wholesalers; (3) the receipt of upfront license fees and milestone payments; (4) royalty revenue in conjunction with sales of Kapruvia in Europe through September 30, 2023; and (5) clinical compound sales from certain license agreements. We are eligible to receive sales-based milestones in the future in accordance with certain licensing agreements.

Table of Contents 
 Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, the revenue received under our agreements with CSL Vifor and Maruishi for royalty and sales-based milestone payments received in conjunction with ex-U.S. sales of KORSUVA/Kapruvia were recorded as other revenue and considered non-cash until we have fulfilled our obligations under HCR Agreement (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). To date, we have earned a total of 138.3 million in clinical development or regulatory milestone payments, clinical compound and commercial compound sales from certain license agreements, collaborative revenue from our share of the profit generated by KORSUVA injection sales, and royalty revenue (which ceased upon entry into the HCR Agreement during the fourth quarter of 2023). Revenue from sales of KORSUVA injection in future periods is subject to uncertainties and will depend on several factors, including the success of our and our commercial partners commercialization efforts in the United States, the number of new patients adopting or switching to KORSUVA injection, patient retention and sustained demand, the number of physicians prescribing KORSUVA injection, the rate of monthly prescriptions, reimbursement from third-party payors including the U.S. government, and market trends. More specifically, in December 2021, CMS granted TDAPA to KORSUVA injection in the anti-pruritic functional category. TDAPA went into effect on April 1, 2022, for two years. On October 27, 2023, CMS published the final CY 2024 rule, which finalized the post-TDAPA add-on payment as proposed in the draft CY 2024 rule. Under the final rule, TDAPA drugs in existing functional categories will receive a post-TDAPA add-on payment set at 65 percent of the total trailing 12-months expenditure levels for the given renal dialysis drug or biological product. The post-TDAPA add-on payment will be applied to all ESRD PPS payments and paid for 3 years, adjusted annually. The add-on payments for KORSUVA injection commenced on April 1, 2024. The anticipated unfavorable CMS reimbursement codified in the final CY 2024 rule has resulted in a lack of sequential revenues growth for KORSUVA injection since its launch. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 3.0 million, which resulted in our profit share amount of 1.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately 2.1 million, which included negative net sales reported by CSL Vifor for the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher rebates and chargebacks due to price decreases on KORSUVA injection related to the expiration of TDAPA in April 2024. We expect no meaningful revenue contribution from KORSUVA injection post its TDAPA expiration. In the third quarter of 2023, FMC decided to reallocate all remaining clinic level inventory within its network of clinics resulting in limited revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Vifor International owned 7,396,770, or 13.5 , of our common stock. CSL Vifor and its affiliates are all considered related parties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (see Note 18 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Related Party Transactions , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) COGS includes costs related to sales of our commercial product, KORSUVA injection, to CSL Vifor. Costs related to the sales of KORSUVA injection are generally recognized upon receipt of shipment by CSL Vifor. Our COGS for KORSUVA injection include the cost of producing commercial product that correspond with commercial supply revenue, such as third-party supply and overhead costs, as well as certain period costs related to freight, packaging, stability, and quality testing. The related COGS for CSL Vifor associated with the net profit share arrangement as well as the marketing and distribution fee for the applicable period reduces our profit share revenue for the period. There was no commercial supply revenue recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded commercial supply revenue of 1.3 million, with associated COGS of 1.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded commercial supply revenue of 0.6 million and 5.8 million, respectively, with associated COGS of 0.6 million for the 2024 period and 5.6 million for the 2023 period. We expect our COGS to be reflective of future KORSUVA injection sales.

 Research and Development (R D) Our R D expenses relate primarily to the development of oral difelikefalin. R D expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing R D activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time R D employees, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, third-party formulation expenses or milestone payments, fees paid to CROs and other vendors and consultants, stock-based compensation for R D employees and consultants, and other outside expenses. Our R D expenses also included expenses related to preclinical activities for our earlier stage programs in prior periods and may include such expenses in the future. R D costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in R D activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. Most of our R D costs have been external costs, which we track on a program-by program basis. Our internal R D costs are primarily compensation expenses for our full-time R D employees. We do not track internal R D costs on a program-by-program basis. R D activities have been central to our business model. Based on our recent announcement that we are discontinuing our NP program, we presently expect that our R D expenses will significantly decrease in the future as we focus on exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. However, it is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs in connection with the discontinuation of our studies in NP or future nonclinical and clinical studies of our current or any future product candidates, should we resume the development of any future product candidates, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval, should we resume the development of any future product candidates. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for oral difelikefalin or any future product candidates, should we resume the development of oral difelikefalin or any future product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of future product candidates, should we resume the development of any future product candidates, will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to: per patient trial costs; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of sites included in the trials; the countries in which the trial is conducted; the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient follow-up; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate. 
 In addition, the probability of success for future product candidates, should we resume the development of any future product candidates, will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. In the future, should we resume the development of any future product candidates, we will determine which, if any, other programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and

 clinical success of future product candidates, as well as an assessment of our future product candidates commercial potential. General and Administrative (G A) G A expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, legal, business development, information technology, or IT, human resources, project management, alliance management, and procurement functions. Other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in R D expenses, legal fees, insurance costs, investor relations costs, patent costs and fees for accounting and consulting services. We anticipate that our G A expenses will decrease in the future as a result of our workforce reductions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, G A expenses will continue to include costs related to remaining personnel, fees to outside consultants, lawyers, and accountants, as well as costs associated with our exploration of potential strategic alternatives, which could offset the decreases from workforce reductions. In addition, if any future product candidate obtains regulatory approval for marketing, should we resume the development of any future product candidates, we may incur expenses associated with building sales and marketing, commercial operations, and market access teams. Our license agreements with CSL Vifor provide full U.S. commercialization rights of KORSUVA injection to CSL Vifor under profit-sharing arrangements. Under these profit-sharing arrangements, in consideration of CSL Vifor s conduct of the marketing, promotion, selling and distribution of KORSUVA injection in the United States, we pay a marketing and distribution fee to CSL Vifor based on the level of annual net sales. This fee as well as CSL Vifor s COGS are deducted from product sales in calculating the net profits that are subject to the profit-sharing arrangement (see Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, C ollaboration and Licensing Arrangements , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Restructuring In January 2024, we announced a workforce reduction of up to 50 of our employees in order to reduce our operating expenses and focus our efforts on development of oral difelikefalin in chronic pruritus associated with NP. On June 14, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a streamlined operating plan exploring strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value after we announced our decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP on June 12, 2024. Our decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP followed the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. Our decision was not related to any safety or medical issues, or negative regulatory feedback related to our NP program. In connection with the streamlined operating plan, our Board of Directors also approved a second reduction in our workforce by approximately 70 , which we substantially completed by June 30, 2024. As of the date of this filing, we have ten employees that are currently working for us. Restructuring expenses consist of pre-tax severance and employee-related costs for those involuntary terminations associated with the discontinuation of our oral programs in atopic dermatitis and chronic kidney disease in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively, the discontinuation of our oral program in NP in June 2024, and the related workforce reductions in 2024 (see Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, C ommitments and Contingencies Restructuring Actions , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Other Income, Net Other income, net consists of interest and dividend income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and property and equipment, as well as accretion of discounts/amortization of premiums on purchases of marketable securities. In the event we record a credit loss expense on our available-for-sale debt securities, those expenses would be offset against other income.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We periodically analyze the recorded values of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable. In these cases, we record an impairment charge during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. This impairment charge is recognized separately on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Inventory Write-Down We periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value and write down such inventories as appropriate. In addition, our product is subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. If certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value. This inventory write-down charge is recognized separately on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Non-cash Interest Expense on Liability Related to Sales of Future Royalties and Milestones Non-cash interest expense on liability related to sales of future royalties and milestone payments, which are received in conjunction with ex-U.S. sales of KORSUVA/Kapruvia under our agreements with CSL Vifor and Maruishi, consists of imputed interest on the carrying value of the liability and the amortization of the related issuance costs resulting from the HCR Agreement (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). This non-cash interest expense is recognized separately on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Income Taxes Historically, our benefit from income taxes related to state R D tax credits exchanged for cash pursuant to the Connecticut R D Tax Credit Exchange Program, which permits qualified small businesses engaged in R D activities within Connecticut to exchange their unused R D tax credits for a cash amount equal to 65 of the value of the exchanged credits. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included tax legislation that became effective early in 2023. Significant legislation for corporate taxpayers includes a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15.0 for companies with 1.0 billion or more in average net financial statement profits over the three previous years, as well as a 1.0 indirect excise tax on the repurchase of shares by a publicly traded company. We do not expect this legislation to have an effect on our tax provision as of September 30, 2024; however, we will continue to evaluate the effect on the tax provision each reporting period.

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change Dollar amounts in thousands Dollar amounts in thousands Collaborative revenue 1,298 2,471 -47 2,086 10,631 -80 Commercial supply revenue 1,252 -100 640 5,843 -89 License and milestone fees 910 -100 910 -100 Royalty revenue 167 -100 415 -100 Clinical compound revenue 66 -100 84 165 -49 Other revenue 1,258 N/A 2,872 N/A Total revenue 2,556 4,866 -47 5,682 17,964 -68 Collaborative Revenue We recognized collaborative revenue of 1.3 million and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.1 million and 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change in collaborative revenue for both periods was primarily related to our share of the profit from CSL Vifor s sales of KORSUVA injection to third parties in the United States, which commercially launched in April 2022. The amount included in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included negative profit share from negative net sales recorded by CSL Vifor for the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher rebates and chargebacks due to price decreases on KORSUVA injection related to the expiration of TDAPA in April 2024. Collaborative revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 0.5 million that we earned in conjunction with the regulatory approval of KORSUVA injection in Japan for a milestone payment we earned in September 2023 from Maruishi that was allocated to the R D services performance obligation under the Maruishi Agreement (see Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Collaboration and Licensing Agreements and Revenue Recognition , respectively, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Commercial Supply Revenue There was no commercial supply revenue recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized commercial supply revenue of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 0.6 million and 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change in commercial supply revenue for both periods was related to our sales of KORSUVA injection to CSL Vifor, which commercially launched in April 2022. License and milestone fees revenue We recognized license and milestone fees revenue of 0.9 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, in conjunction with the regulatory approval of KORSUVA injection in Japan for a milestone payment we earned in September 2023 from Maruishi that was allocated to the license and milestone fee performance obligation under the Maruishi Agreement (see Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Collaboration and Licensing Agreements and Revenue Recognition , respectively, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Royalty revenue We recognized royalty revenue of approximately 167,000 and 415,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which was related to our royalties on the net sales of Kapruvia in Europe prior to

 October 1, 2023. Beginning on October 1, 2023, royalty revenue will no longer be recognized until we have fulfilled our obligations under the HCR Agreement (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). As a result, there was no royalty revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Clinical compound revenue There was no clinical compound revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized clinical compound revenue of approximately 84,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 66,000 and 165,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which were related to sales of clinical compound to Maruishi. Other revenue We recognized non-cash revenue of approximately 1.3 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represent royalty payments earned in conjunction with ex-U.S. sales of KORSUVA/Kapruvia under our agreements with CSL Vifor and Maruishi, which were sold to HCR under the HCR Agreement. There was no non-cash revenue recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

We recorded COGS of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 0.6 million and 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were related to our commercial supply revenue for KORSUVA injection sales to CSL Vifor for these periods. Research and Development Expense 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change Dollar amounts in thousands Dollar amounts in thousands Direct clinical trial costs 1,444 16,210 -91 22,905 50,496 -55 Consultant services in support of clinical trials 7 1,381 -99 1,076 3,810 -72 Stock-based compensation 16 1,477 -99 1,044 4,699 -78 Depreciation and amortization 28 -100 50 86 -42 Other R D operating expenses (105) 6,355 -102 7,559 21,004 -64 Total R D expense 1,362 25,451 -95 32,634 80,095 -59 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the 16.1 million decrease in direct clinical trial costs and consultant services in support of clinical trials was primarily due to decreases related to the discontinuation of our oral difelikefalin atopic dermatitis program due to the clinical trial results announced in December 2023, the discontinuation of our oral difelikefalin program in advanced chronic kidney disease in January 2024, the discontinuation of our oral difelikefalin NP program due to the clinical trial results announced in June 2024, and decreases in supportive studies and other general costs associated with oral difelikefalin. The decrease in stock compensation expense is primarily related to the reductions in workforce in January 2024 and June 2024, as well as additional workforce reductions during the three months ended September 2024. The decrease in other R D

 operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to decreases in payroll and related costs, travel costs and other related conference costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the 30.3 million decrease in direct clinical trial costs and consultant services in support of clinical trials was primarily due to decreases related to the discontinuation of our oral difelikefalin atopic dermatitis program due to the clinical trial results announced in December 2023, the discontinuation of our oral difelikefalin program in advanced chronic kidney disease in January 2024, and decreases in supportive studies and other general costs associated with oral difelikefalin, partially offset by increases related to our former oral difelikefalin NP program, which was discontinued due to the clinical trial results announced in June 2024. The decrease in stock compensation expense is primarily related to the reductions in workforce in January 2024 and June 2024, as well as a few additional workforce reductions during the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by performance-based restricted stock units that were achieved in March 2024. The decrease in other R D operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to decreases in payroll and related costs, travel costs and other related conference costs. The following table summarizes our R D expenses by program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in stock compensation expense is primarily related to the reductions in workforce in January 2024 and June 2024, as well as additional workforce reductions during the three months ended September 2024. The increase in other G A operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was

 primarily due to Patheon minimum manufacturing orders of 0.6 million in 2024, partially offset by decreases in payroll and related costs, travel costs and other related conference costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in professional fees and public/investor relations was primarily due to decreases in legal costs. The increase in stock compensation expense is primarily related to performance-based restricted stock units that were achieved in March 2024, partially offset by the reductions in workforce in January 2024 and June 2024, as well as additional workforce reductions during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in other G A operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to decreases in payroll and related costs, travel costs and other related conference costs, partially offset by our negative profit share amount recorded for CSL Vifor s negative net sales for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.6 million due to Patheon for minimum manufacturing orders in 2024.

There were no restructuring expenses recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring expenses were 5.7 million which were related to our strategic prioritization of NP in January 2024 and the resulting discontinuation of our NP program in June 2024, our exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, and the associated workforce reductions during the year. There were no restructuring expenses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other Income, Net

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in other income, net was primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a lower balance in our portfolio of investments in 2024 as compared to 2023, partially offset by an increase in accretion income from our available-for-sale marketable securities in the 2024 period as compared to the prior period.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 4.3 million impairment charge on our right of use asset as a result of the assignment of our corporate lease in September 2024. Inventory Write-Down

Non-cash Interest Expense on Liability Related to the Sales of Future Royalties and Milestones 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change Dollar amounts in thousands Dollar amounts in thousands Non-cash interest expense on liability related to sales of future royalties and milestones 1,960 N/A 5,852 N/A We recognized 2.0 million and 5.9 million of non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sales of future royalties and milestones for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which represented imputed interest on the carrying value of the liability to HCR, and the amortization of the related issuance costs associated with the HCR Agreement. There was no non-cash interest expense on liability recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as the HCR Agreement was entered into in the fourth quarter of 2023 (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). Benefit from Income Taxes We have not exchanged our R D tax credit for cash for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and were not eligible to exchange our R D tax credit for cash for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, therefore there was no benefit from income taxes for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We recognized a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options is recognized as a deferred tax asset that is offset by a corresponding valuation allowance. As such, our effective tax rate is zero for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Capital Requirements, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Short-Term and Long-Term Cash Requirements Our primary uses of capital have been third-party clinical R D services, clinical costs related to the oral difelikefalin program, and compensation and related expenses. As of September 30, 2024, we have no commitments for capital expenditures in either the short-term or long-term. The following discussion summarizes our current and long-term material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024,

 which we expect to fund primarily with current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities: 

Material Cash Requirements (amounts in thousands) Total 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Operating lease obligation (1) Manufacturing purchase obligations (2) 1,509 1,509 Other obligations (3) 1,500 1,500 Total 3,009 3,009 

 (1) As a result of the Assignment Agreements in September 2024, there are no further cash requirements pertaining to our operating lease for corporate office space that terminates on November 1, 2024. The non-cash lease payment of 3.4 million that pertains to property and equipment being transferred to the assignee on November 1, 2024 was not included in the table above. See Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details about our operating lease. (2) Based on our MSA with Patheon that we entered into in July 2019, we had a purchase capacity reservation through December 31, 2024. Of the 1.5 million included in the table above, 0.6 million has been included within accounts payable and accrued expenses for minimum manufacturing orders through September 30, 2024. We expect the remaining manufacturing obligations to be incurred and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details about our MSA with Patheon. We have no other material non-cancelable purchase commitments with any other contract manufacturers or service providers, as we have generally contracted on a cancelable purchase order basis. (3) We were required to maintain a stand-by letter of credit as a security deposit under our new lease for office space in Stamford, Connecticut. As a result of the Assignment Agreements in September 2024, the 1.5 million of restricted cash became unrestricted in October 2024. See Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Restricted Cash , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details about our letter of credit for our lease for our principal office in Stamford, Connecticut. Based on the Enteris License Agreement that we entered into in August 2019, we are obligated to pay (1) milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones and (2) low-single digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. As these milestone payments may or may not be achieved, and royalties may or may not be owed depending on our future commercial success, there were no future potential payments that were considered cash requirements in the table above as of September 30, 2024. We did not make any milestone payments to Enteris during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. See Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details about our Enteris License Agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Cara Royalty Sub, entered into the HCR Agreement with HCR pursuant to which Cara Royalty Sub sold to HCR certain of its rights to the Royalties, due and payable to Cara Royalty Sub (as our assignee) under our agreements with CSL Vifor and Maruishi, in exchange for up to 40.0 million. We have retained all of our rights, title and interest in, to and under the Covered License Agreements that relate to any non-intravenous formulation of difelikefalin. These future payments to HCR were not included in the table above since the amounts and timing of royalty and milestone payments received under the agreements with CSL Vifor and Maruishi could change in the future as they are subject to CSL Vifor s and Maruishi s commercialization efforts (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). We do not have any other requirements or off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources.

 Since inception, we have incurred significant operating and net losses. We incurred net losses of 12.5 million and 28.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 63.2 million and 86.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 747.9 million. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, should we resume the development of any future product candidates, and the future sales of KORSUVA. We anticipate that our expenses will be focused on: the discontinuation of our clinical program for oral difelikefalin for chronic pruritus associated with NP; and the exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. 
 Should we resume the development of any future product candidate, the successful development of any future product candidate is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any future product candidate, should we resume the development of future product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate any further material net cash inflows from difelikefalin or any other future product candidate. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medicines, including the uncertainty of: successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials, should we resume the development of any future product candidates; receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, should we resume the development of any future product candidates; establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers, should we resume the development of any future product candidates; obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for difelikefalin or any future product candidate; launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others, should we resume the development of any future product candidates; achieving meaningful penetration in the markets which we seek to serve, should we resume the development of any future product candidates; and obtaining adequate coverage or reimbursement by third parties, such as commercial payers and government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, should we resume the development of any future product candidates. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of oral difelikefalin or any of our future product candidates, should we resume the development of oral difelikefalin or any future product candidates, would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Further, the timing of any of the above may be impacted by global economic conditions and significant global events, should we resume the development of oral difelikefalin or any future product candidate, introducing additional uncertainty. We currently are exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidates, we would require additional capital beyond our current balances of cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities and anticipated amounts as described above, and this additional capital may not be available when needed, on reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and continuing

 disruptions to and volatility in the credit and equity markets in the United States and worldwide, including impacts from global health crises, geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and increasing tensions between China and Taiwan, and government actions implemented as a result of the foregoing, fluctuations in inflation, rising interest rates, uncertainty and liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and a potential recession in the United States. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or convertible debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Sources of Liquidity Since our inception to date, we have raised an aggregate of 943.8 million to fund our operations, including (1) net proceeds of 447.4 million from the sale of shares of our common stock in five public offerings, including our initial public offering; as well as the sale of our common stock under our open market sales agreement in 2023; (2) proceeds of 73.3 million from the sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock and from debt financings prior to our initial public offering; (3) 258.8 million under our license and supply agreements (including commercial supply sales and royalty payments), primarily with CSL Vifor, Maruishi, CKDP, and an earlier product candidate for which development efforts ceased in 2007; (4) our share of the profit generated by KORSUVA injection sales of 29.8 million; (5) net proceeds of 98.0 million from the purchase of our common stock in relation to the license agreements with CSL Vifor; and (6) net proceeds of 36.5 million from the sale of future ex-U.S. royalties and milestones to HCR under our agreements with CSL Vifor and Maruishi (see Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Collaboration and Licensing Agreements , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). On June 14, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a streamlined operating plan exploring strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value after we announced our decision to discontinue the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP on June 12, 2024. This exploration includes substantial uncertainties, including whether we are able to identify and implement any potential strategic alternatives, in a timely manner or at all, whether we realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of any such transaction and whether any such transactions would generate value for stockholders. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Cara Royalty Sub, entered into the HCR Agreement with HCR pursuant to which Cara Royalty Sub sold to HCR certain of its rights to receive the Royalties, due and payable to Cara Royalty Sub (as our assignee) under the Covered License Agreements, in exchange for up to 40.0 million. We have retained all of our rights, title and interest in, to and under the Covered License Agreements that relate to any non-intravenous formulation of difelikefalin. Under the terms of the HCR Agreement, Cara Royalty Sub received an initial payment of 17.5 million less certain transaction costs in November 2023. In December 2023, we received an additional 20.0 million, less certain advisory fees, upon satisfying the milestone event for pricing for Kapruvia (difelikefalin) in Germany being approved above a certain threshold amount per dose. The terms of the HCR Agreement also provide for an additional 2.5 million milestone payment to Cara Royalty Sub upon achievement of a 2024 sales milestone of KORSUVA in Japan. As of the date of this filing, we expect to achieve this milestone in the fourth quarter of 2024. In order to fund our future operations, including our planned clinical trials at the time, on March 1, 2022, we filed a universal shelf registration statement, or the Shelf Registration Statement, which provides for aggregate offerings of up to 300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants or any combination thereof. The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 11, 2022. The securities registered under the Shelf Registration Statement include 154.5 million of unsold securities that had been registered under our previous Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-230333) that was declared effective on April 4, 2019. On March 6, 2024, the date we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December

Table of Contents 
 31, 2023, we became subject to the offering limits in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. Pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, in no event will we sell shares of our common stock under our Shelf Registration Statement with a value of more than one-third of our public float in any 12-month period, so long as our public float is less than 75.0 million. We have not offered and sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 during the prior 12 calendar month period that ends on and includes the date hereof. On March 1, 2022, we entered into an open market sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, issue and sell common stock with an aggregate value of up to 80.0 million in an at-the-market offering pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. Jefferies is acting as sole sales agent for any sales made under the Sales Agreement for a 3 commission on gross proceeds. In June 2024, we filed an amendment to the prospectus dated May 11, 2022 for the at-the-market offering, or the ATM Prospectus, to update the amount of shares of our common stock we are eligible to sell under General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, as described above, and pursuant to the Sales Agreement. Pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, in no event will we sell shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Prospectus, as amended, with a value of more than one-third of our public float in any 12-month period, so long as our public float is less than 75.0 million. If our public float increases above 75.0 million such that we may sell additional amounts under the Sales Agreement and the ATM Prospectus, we will file another amendment to the ATM Prospectus prior to making additional sales in excess of the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. The common stock will be sold at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, and, as a result, prices may vary. Unless otherwise terminated earlier, the Sales Agreement continues until all shares available under the Sales Agreement have been sold. No shares were sold under the Sales Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 386,881 shares were sold under the Sales Agreement and we received net proceeds of 1.1 million. In recognition of the decision by our Board of Directors to approve a streamlined operating plan exploring strategic alternatives, as described elsewhere in this report, we currently do not have any intention to sell shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement. We may offer additional securities under our Shelf Registration Statement from time to time in response to market conditions or other circumstances if we believe such a plan of financing is in the best interests of our stockholders. Under our agreement with CSL Vifor for the commercialization of KORSUVA injection, we are eligible to receive commercial milestone payments in the aggregate of up to 240.0 million from CSL Vifor upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones. In October 2021, we received a 50.0 million milestone payment from CSL Vifor in exchange for the issuance of 3,282,391 shares of our common stock to CSL Vifor as a result of the regulatory approval of KORSUVA injection in August 2021. To date, we have received 50.0 million of regulatory milestones from CSL Vifor under this agreement. Under a separate agreement with CSL Vifor, we are eligible to receive commercial milestone payments in the aggregate of up to 440.0 million, all of which are sales related. We are also eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalty payments based on annual net sales of difelikefalin injection in the licensed territories. To date, we have received 30.0 million of regulatory milestones from CSL Vifor. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into the HCR Agreement where we sold our future royalties and milestone payments under this agreement to HCR (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). Under the Maruishi Agreement, we are also potentially eligible to earn up to an aggregate of 6.0 million in clinical development milestones and 4.5 million in regulatory milestones, before any foreign exchange adjustment, as well as tiered royalties, with percentages ranging from the low double digits to the low twenties, based on net sales of products containing difelikefalin in Japan, if any, and share in any sub-license fees. In September 2023, Maruishi received manufacturing and marketing approval from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for KORSUVA IV Injection Syringe for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. To date, we have received 6.5 million (before contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments) for clinical development and regulatory milestones from Maruishi. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into the HCR Agreement where we sold our future royalties and milestone payments to HCR (see Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement above). Under the CKDP Agreement, we are potentially eligible to earn up to an aggregate of 2.3 million in clinical development milestones and 1.5 million in regulatory milestones, before South Korean withholding tax, as well as

 tiered royalties with percentages ranging from the high single digits to the high teens, based on net sales of products containing difelikefalin in South Korea, if any, and share in any sub-license fees. To date, 2.3 million (before South Korean withholding tax) of development and regulatory milestones have been received under the CKDP Agreement. In December 2021, CMS granted TDAPA designation to KORSUVA injection in the anti-pruritic functional category. TDAPA went into effect on April 1, 2022, for two years. On October 27, 2023, CMS published the final CY 2024 rule, which finalized the post-TDAPA add-on as proposed in the draft CY 2024 rule. Under the final rule, TDAPA drugs in existing functional categories will receive a post-TDAPA add-on payment set at 65 percent of the total trailing 12-months expenditure levels for the given renal dialysis drug or biological product. The post-TDAPA add-on payment adjustment will be applied to all ESRD PPS payments and paid for 3 years, adjusted annually. The add-on payments for KORSUVA injection commenced on April 1, 2024. The unfavorable CMS reimbursement codified in the final CY2024 rule has resulted in a lack of sequential revenues growth for KORSUVA injection since its launch. As a result, we expect no meaningful revenue contribution from KORSUVA injection post its TDAPA expiration. Our ability to earn these milestone and royalty payments and their timing is dependent upon successful commercialization of KORSUVA injection/Kapruvia, and successful future repayments made to HCR using CSL Vifor and Maruishi milestones and royalties under the HCR Agreement. However, our receipt of any further such amounts is uncertain at this time and we may never receive any more of these amounts. Outlook As a result of the discontinuation of our clinical NP program, our workforce reductions in 2024, and our exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, we expect that our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated operating plan for at least the next 12 months. Our anticipated operating expenses include contractually committed costs as well as non-contractually committed clinical trial costs for trials that are closing based on our Board of Directors new strategic plan. It is possible that the assumptions upon which we have based this estimate may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we presently expect. Cash Flows The following is a summary of the net cash flows provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Dollar amounts in thousands Net cash used in operating activities (56,874) (74,708) Net cash provided by investing activities 43,741 73,666 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (1,989) 1,676 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (15,122) 634 Net cash used in operating activities Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of a net loss of 63.2 million and a 13.3 million cash outflow from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a 19.6 million cash inflow from net non-cash charges. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a decrease of 19.1 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to operating payments made during the period and a 4.3 million cash lease payment made to assign our corporate lease to a third party on November 1, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses of 5.8 million, primarily related to a decrease in prepaid clinical costs, a decrease in accounts receivable, net related party of 2.3 million, and an increase of 2.1 million for lease incentives reimbursed to us during the 2024 period. Net non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Basis of Presentation , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in our Annual Report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 We define our critical accounting estimates as those subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply U.S. GAAP. Our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates are more fully described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report and in Note 2 to our audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report. Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted; Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Annual Report for a full description of accounting pronouncements recently adopted, and issued but not yet adopted, if applicable. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Historically, we invested substantially all of our cash reserves in a variety of available-for-sale marketable securities, including investment-grade debt instruments, principally corporate bonds, commercial paper, municipal bonds and direct obligations of the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored entities, and in cash equivalents. See Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Available-for-Sale Marketable Securities , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details about our available-for-sale marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had invested 5.0 million of our cash reserves in such marketable securities. Those marketable securities included 5.0 million of investment grade debt instruments with a yield of approximately 0.90 and maturities through November 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had invested 49.0 million of our cash reserves in such marketable securities. Those marketable securities included 49.0 million of investment grade debt instruments with a yield of approximately 4.41 and maturities through November 2024. We maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy, which includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and diversification. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity and to meet operating needs. Our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates related to our investments. As a result, we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the fair value of a security that will result from a change in interest rates. Applying the duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point, or 1 , increase in interest rates as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, would have resulted in immaterial decreases in the fair values of our portfolio of marketable securities at those dates. Credit Quality Risk Although our investments are subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment. Nonetheless, deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate unrealized losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities were approximately 25,000 and 0.3 million, respectively. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not record any 

 61

 charges to credit loss expense for our available-for-sale securities. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Available-for-Sale Marketable Securities , in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accounts receivable, net - related party from CSL Vifor of approximately 0.4 million and 2.8 million, respectively, which primarily related to royalty payments from CSL Vifor in the current period and our profit-sharing revenue from sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States by CSL Vifor, our commercial supply of KORSUVA injection to CSL Vifor, and royalty payments from CSL Vifor in the prior period. We also had approximately 0.8 million and 0.4 million recorded within other receivables for Japan royalties/milestones owed to us from Maruishi which was included within other receivables as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe that credit risk associated with CSL Vifor and Maruishi are not significant. We review the need for an allowance for credit losses for any receivable based on various factors including payment history and historical bad debt experience. We had an insignificant allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures . Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls and Procedures Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations of the effectiveness of all control systems, no evaluation of controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Cara Therapeutics, Inc. have been detected.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become subject to arbitration, litigation or claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any arbitration or legal proceeding that, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. The results of any future claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and litigation costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and trading price of our securities. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, together with all other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as our other filings with the SEC in evaluating our business and future prospects and an investment in our common stock. We may disclose changes to risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. Risk Factors Summary Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as fully described below. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our common stock risky include, among others: We may not be successful in identifying and implementing any potential strategic alternatives in a timely manner or at all, and any strategic transactions that we may consummate in the future could have negative consequences. Even if we successfully consummate any strategic transaction, or series of transactions, from our strategic assessment, we may fail to realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, such benefits may take longer to realize than expected, we may encounter integration difficulties or we may be exposed to other operational and financial risks. The value to stockholders in the event of a strategic transaction or dissolution may depend on the extent to which we will be able to successfully satisfy our existing contractual obligations to third parties and regulatory commitments on favorable terms, which may include the outcome of our negotiations to reduce or terminate such commitments. We may become involved in litigation, including securities class action litigation, that could divert our management s attention and harm our business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages. We have incurred significant losses since inception, and we anticipate that we may incur losses in the foreseeable future. We may never achieve profitability.

 If we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may be delisted and the price of our common stock, our ability to access the capital markets and our financial condition could be negatively impacted. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. If we decide to resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs. Should we resume development of our product candidate or future product candidates, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, manufacturers upon whom we may rely could fail to produce a product candidate in the volumes that we may require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, and we could face delays in the development of our product candidate. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, even if we obtain regulatory approvals for such, they may never be successfully launched or become profitable, in which case our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be materially harmed. If we or our collaborators are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities, or if we are unable to enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product and, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, any product candidate, if they are approved, we may be unable to generate product revenues. Any collaboration arrangements that we are a party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and ultimately commercialize our product candidate or any potential future product candidate. We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other R D organizations. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, if we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented. The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. Should we resume development activities in the future, if we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required additional regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize any product candidates as expected, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.

 We are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards, contracts, industry standards, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation (including class claims) and mass arbitration demands, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue and profits, and otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. We may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Risks Related to Our Strategic Review Process We may not be successful in identifying and implementing any potential strategic alternatives in a timely manner or at all, and any strategic transactions that we may consummate in the future could have negative consequences. In June 2024, we announced that we are undertaking a comprehensive exploration of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. We have been devoting, and expect to continue to devote, substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives that our Board of Directors believes will maximize stockholder value. Despite management devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, there can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that we will be able to successfully consummate any particular strategic transaction on attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all. For example, certain types of strategic transactions may require third party consents, such as stockholder approval, which could be difficult or costly to obtain. We have not set a timetable for completion of this strategic review process, and our Board of Directors has not approved a definitive course of action. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value or that we will make any cash distributions to our stockholders. The process of continuing to evaluate our strategic alternatives may be costly, time-consuming and complex, and we may incur significant legal, accounting and advisory fees and other expenses, some of which may be incurred regardless of whether we successfully enter into a transaction. We may also incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with this process. Any such expenses will decrease the remaining cash available for use in our business. Our ability to pursue or consummate strategic transactions also depends upon our ability to retain certain of our employees, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the ability to identify, negotiate and consummate such transaction. If we are unable to successfully retain certain of our key remaining personnel, we are at risk of a disruption to our exploration and consummation of one or more strategic transactions. In addition, potential counterparties in a strategic transaction involving us may place minimal or no value on our assets and our public listing. Further, should we resume the development of future product candidates, such as one or more of the programs in our pipeline for which we halted further development in December 2023, January 2024 and June 2024, the development and any potential commercialization of our future product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund the costs associated with conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval. Consequently, any potential counterparty in a strategic transaction involving us may choose not to spend additional resources to resume or continue development of our future product candidates and may attribute little or no value, in such a transaction, to our future product candidates. In addition, any strategic transactions that we may pursue could have a variety of negative consequences, and we may enter into a transaction that yields unexpected results that adversely affect our business and decreases the remaining cash available for use in our business. Any potential transaction would be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in a potential transaction with us, obtaining stockholder approval and the availability of financing to third parties in a potential transaction with us on reasonable terms. There can be no assurance that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated, lead to increased stockholder value, or achieve the anticipated results.

 If we are not successful in setting forth a new strategic path for us, or if our plans are not executed in a timely fashion, this may cause reputational harm with our stockholders and the value of our securities may be adversely impacted. In addition, speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to the future of us could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. Even if we successfully consummate any strategic transaction, or series of transactions, from our strategic assessment, we may fail to realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, such benefits may take longer to realize than expected, we may encounter integration difficulties or we may be exposed to other operational and financial risks. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any potential strategic transaction will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate with any future business partner, our ability to obtain value for portions of our business, if divested, and our ability to generate future stockholder value. The process may be disruptive to our business and the expected benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. The failure to meet the challenges involved and to realize the anticipated benefits of any potential transaction could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The negotiation and consummation of any potential strategic transaction will require significant time on the part of our management, and the diversion of management s attention may disrupt our business. The negotiation and consummation of any such transaction may also require more time or greater cash resources than we anticipate and expose us to other operational and financial risks, including, but not limited to, increased near-term and long-term expenditures, exposure to unknown liabilities, higher than expected acquisition or integration costs, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund future operations, including financings in connection with a strategic transaction, write-downs of assets or goodwill or incurrence of non-recurring, impairment or other charges, increased amortization expenses, difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired or acquiring business with our operations and personnel, impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired or acquiring business due to changes in management and ownership, inability to retain our key employees or any acquired or acquiring business and possibility of future litigation. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. If a strategic transaction is not consummated, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend significantly on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that may need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities. There can be no assurance that a strategic transaction will be completed. If a strategic transaction is not completed, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, with the passage of time, the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. In addition, if our Board of Directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations and the timing of any such resolution is uncertain. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our Board of Directors, in consultation with our advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The value to stockholders in the event of a strategic transaction or dissolution may depend on the extent to which we will be able to successfully satisfy our existing contractual obligations to third parties and regulatory commitments on favorable terms, which may include the outcome of our negotiations to reduce or terminate such commitments. We are currently subject to certain contractual and regulatory obligations and commitments. In connection with our comprehensive exploration of strategic alternatives, we may seek to negotiate with third parties in order to reduce or 

 66 

Table of Contents 
 eliminate such obligations and commitments. Our ability to successfully negotiate such obligations or commitments on favorable terms, or at all, or our ability to satisfy any such obligations may impact our ability to pursue a strategic transaction on terms favorable to us, the resulting value to stockholders in a strategic transaction or the cash available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of our dissolution. We may also incur substantial costs in connection with or as a result of such negotiations or termination of any of our commitments. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating to reduce or eliminate any of our existing contractual or regulatory obligations and commitments, or that we will be able to satisfy any such obligations on a timetable that will allow us to maximize potential value to our stockholders. We may become involved in litigation, including securities class action litigation, that could divert our management s attention and harm our business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages. In the past, litigation, including securities class action litigation, has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, or the announcement of negative events. These events may also result in investigations by the SEC. We may be exposed to such litigation even if no wrongdoing occurred. Litigation is usually expensive and diverts management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and cash resources and our ability to consummate a potential strategic transaction or the ultimate value our stockholders receive in any such transaction. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements We have incurred significant losses from our inception, and we anticipate that we may incur losses in the foreseeable future. We are a biopharmaceutical company. Until recently, we had focused our efforts primarily on developing KORSUVA injection, Kapruvia and oral difelikefalin for a number of indications with the goal of achieving regulatory approval and, more recently, commercializing KORSUVA injection and Kapruvia. However, the commercial launches of KORSUVA injection and Kapruvia did not achieve meaningful success and, in January 2024, we made the strategic decision to focus our efforts on developing oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus associated with NP. In June 2024, we discontinued the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. We are undertaking a comprehensive exploration of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating and net losses. We incurred net losses of 118.5 million, 85.5 million and 88.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also incurred net losses of 12.5 million and 28.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 63.2 million and 86.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 747.9 million. In connection with the termination of all ongoing clinical programs noted above, our research and development expenses have decreased. We expect to continue to incur costs and expenditures in connection with the process of evaluating our strategic alternatives. Should we resume development activities in the future, we expect that research and development costs would increase significantly and we would continue to incur significant expenses and operating and net losses, as we develop and seek regulatory approval for such product candidates. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly from year to year, depending on whether we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidates, the timing of any clinical trials, the receipt of payments under any future agreements we may enter into, and our expenditures on other R D activities as well as any payments owed under the License Agreement with Enteris and any future similar agreements. Should we resume the development activities in the future, we expect we would to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we: continue the development of any product candidate;

 seek regulatory approvals for any product candidate that successfully completes clinical trials; establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure in the United States and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; maintain, expand and protect our global intellectual property portfolio; hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development and potential future commercialization efforts. Revenues from KORSUVA injection will not be sufficient to enable us to reach profitability. To become and remain profitable from product sales, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing one or more products that generate significant revenue. In order to commercialize any product candidate, we will need to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including, should we resume the development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, successful registration of oral difelikefalin, discovering, developing, licensing or acquiring additional product candidates and completing preclinical testing and clinical trials for those product candidates, potentially entering into collaboration and license agreements, obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling approved products and product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of our product candidate, our expenses could increase. Even if we do achieve profitability from product sales, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, should we resume the development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, maintain our R D efforts and diversify our product offerings, or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment. If we decide to resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs. Conducting clinical trials, pursuing regulatory approvals, establishing outsourced manufacturing relationships, and successfully manufacturing and commercializing products and product candidates is expensive. If we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we will need to raise additional capital to resume the development of oral difelikefalin and potentially in-license or acquire other product candidates. In January 2024, we announced a prioritization of our pipeline to focus our resources on our late-stage clinical program evaluating oral difelikefalin in chronic pruritus associated with NP and terminate our Phase 3 clinical program evaluating oral difelikefalin in pruritus associated with advanced chronic kidney disease, including our KICK 1 and KICK 2 Phase 3 clinical trials. As part of this strategic update, in the first quarter of 2024, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 50 . In June 2024, we discontinued the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. Following the discontinuation of the clinical program in NP, we announced that we are 

 68 

Table of Contents 
 undertaking a comprehensive exploration of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. In connection with our streamlined operating plan, we further reduced our headcount by approximately 70 . After taking into account the discontinuation of our clinical development programs, reduction in workforce and comprehensive exploration of strategic alternatives, we expect that our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated operating plan for at least the next 12 months. In connection with the termination of all ongoing clinical programs, our research and development expenses have decreased. We expect to continue to incur costs and expenditures in connection with the process of evaluating our strategic alternatives. Should we resume development activities in the future, we expect that research and development costs would increase significantly. It is possible that the assumptions upon which we have based this estimate may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we presently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: the discontinuation of our clinical program for oral difelikefalin for chronic pruritus associated with NP; the exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value; should we resume development activities in the future, the rate of progress and costs related development of and any trials for product candidates; should we resume development activities in the future, the rate of progress and costs for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with any product candidate, including any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so; the effect of competing technological and market developments; and the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish. 
 Future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we may seek to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, milestone and royalty payments from corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements, as well as through interest income earned on cash and investment balances. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and interest rates, the continuing disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, including resulting from the ongoing conflicts between Russia and the Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and increasing tensions between China and Taiwan. Risks Related to Our Business and the Development and Commercialization of Our Product and Potential Product Candidates Should we resume development of our product candidate or future product candidates, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidates, our business will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of such product candidates. In January 2024, we announced a prioritization of our pipeline to focus our resources on our late-stage clinical program evaluating oral difelikefalin in chronic pruritus associated with NP and terminate our Phase 3 clinical program

 evaluating oral difelikefalin in pruritus associated with advanced chronic kidney disease, including our KICK 1 and KICK 2 Phase 3 clinical trials. In June 2024, we discontinued the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. Should we resume development activities in the future, we cannot be certain that any such product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Regulatory authorities may interpret our data differently than we do. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and, should we resume development activities in the future we may never receive such regulatory approval for oral difelikefalin or any future product candidates. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidates, the success of such product candidates will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials, as well as completion of preclinical studies favorable efficacy and acceptable safety data from our clinical trials and other studies receipt of additional regulatory approvals managing our reliance on sole-source third parties such as our third-party vendors, suppliers, and manufacturers the performance by CROs or other third parties and consultants we may retain of their duties to us in a manner that complies with our protocols and applicable laws and that protects the integrity of the resulting data obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity ensuring we do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the valid patent, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of third parties successfully launching, either alone or with a commercial partner, any product candidate for which regulatory approval is received obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement from third-party payers and governments for products and product candidates competition with other products post-marketing commitments, if any, to regulatory agencies following regulatory approval of any product candidate continued acceptable safety profile following regulatory approval and manufacturing or obtaining sufficient supplies of our products and any product candidate that may be necessary for use in clinical trials for evaluation of any product candidate and commercialization of any approved product. 
 If we do not achieve and maintain one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays in our ability to, or be unable to obtain regulatory approvals for, and/or to successfully commercialize any products or product candidates, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product

 candidate, which would materially harm our business and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations. Clinical and preclinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and outcomes, and the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any potential future product candidate, such product candidate may not achieve favorable results in clinical trials or preclinical studies or receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all. Drug development is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we cannot guarantee that any clinical trials or preclinical studies will be conducted as planned, including whether we are able to meet expected timeframes for data readouts, or complete on schedule, if at all, and failure can occur at any time during the trial or study process, including due to factors that are beyond our control. Should we resume development activities in the future, the results from preclinical studies or clinical trials of oral difelikefalin, any potential future product candidates, or a competitor s product candidate in the same class may not predict the results of later clinical trials, and interim, topline or preliminary results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Oral difelikefalin or any future product candidate in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired characteristics despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. It is not uncommon to observe results in clinical trials that are unexpected based on preclinical studies and early clinical trials, and many product candidates fail in clinical trials despite very promising early results. For example, in December 2023, we announced the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KIND 1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin in moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis as an adjunct to topical corticosteroids. In the study, oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit, which resulted in our decision to discontinue the clinical program in atopic dermatitis. Further, in June 2024, we discontinued the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data may be susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies. Such setbacks have occurred and may occur for many reasons, including, but not limited to: clinical sites and investigators may deviate from clinical trial protocols, whether due to lack of training or otherwise, and we may fail to detect any such deviations in a timely manner; patients may fail to adhere to any required clinical trial procedures, including any requirements for post-treatment follow-up; product candidates may fail to demonstrate safety, potency (or efficacy) in certain patient subpopulations, which has not been observed in earlier trials due to limited sample size, lack of analysis or otherwise; or, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, our clinical trials may not adequately represent the patient populations we intend to treat, whether due to limitations in our trial designs or otherwise, such as where one patient subgroup is overrepresented in the clinical trial. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer similar setbacks despite the data we may observe in earlier studies. Based upon negative or inconclusive results, we or any current or any future collaborator may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, which would cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delays and may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all. As a result, we cannot be certain that, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, any clinical trials or preclinical studies will be successful. Any safety concerns observed in any clinical trials, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of such product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

 Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, if we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we may not be able to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials for any such product candidate if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as our future product candidates, should we resume development activities in the future, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors product candidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including: the size and nature of the patient population; the severity of the disease under investigation; the eligibility criteria for, and design of, the trial in question; the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; competition in recruiting and enrolling patients in clinical trials; the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; the patient referral practices of physicians; the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and delays or difficulties due to public health crises, such as pandemics or other similar outbreaks. For example, we experienced a delay in patient enrollment for our Phase 2 clinical trial of oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus in patients with hepatic impairment due to primary biliary cholangitis that led to our decision to discontinue and unblind this trial. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we could in the future experience similar delays in programs for such product candidates. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. We may encounter difficulties and/or delays in completing any future enrollments, should we resume development activities in the future. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidate, or the inability to complete development of our product candidate, which would cause the value of our company to decline, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, and materially impair our ability to generate revenues. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Any agreements we may enter into might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements 

 72

 that would delay our product development activities, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, and adversely affect our business. Our reliance on these third parties for development activities will reduce our control over these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, should we resume development activities in the future, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with FDA s good laboratory practice, or GLP, as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced, under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations should we resume development activities in the future, may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Should we resume development activities in the future, CROs we engage may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. In addition, our CROs would not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we would not be able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical, non-clinical and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct any future preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to any future clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials, should we resume development activities in the future, may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for any such product candidate and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our products and product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our products and product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. If any of our relationships with a third-party CRO that we engage terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, should we resume development activities in the future, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, manufacturers upon whom we may rely could fail to produce a product candidate in the volumes that we may require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, and we could face delays in the development of a product candidate. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any such product candidate for preclinical and clinical testing. If we were to 

 73 

Table of Contents 
 experience an unexpected loss of supply of a product candidate for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any clinical studies. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, any problems or delays we experience in preparing for commercial-scale manufacturing of a product or product candidate may result in a delay in FDA approval of the product or product candidate or may impair our ability to manufacture commercial quantities, which would adversely affect our business. For example, our manufacturers would need to produce specific batches of a product or product candidate to demonstrate acceptable stability under various conditions and for commercially viable lengths of time. We and our contract manufacturers would need to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory authorities acceptable stability data for any product candidate, as well as validate methods and manufacturing processes, in order to receive and maintain regulatory approval to commercialize any approved product candidates. Furthermore, if our commercial manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk drug substance or finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our product and we would lose potential revenues. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the products and product candidates and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Manufacturers that we engage may not perform as agreed. If manufacturers we engage were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide products for commercialization and product candidates to patients in any future clinical trials, should we resume development activities in the future, would be jeopardized. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Further, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we may rely on proprietary technology developed by contract manufacturers for purposes of manufacturing certain of our products and product candidates and our failure to negotiate or maintain the long-term use of any such proprietary technology or the inability for our contract manufacturers to produce any products and product candidates or components of any products and product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, may lead to delays or interruptions in the regulatory approval or commercialization process, as well as increased costs. For example, in August 2019, we entered into the Enteris License Agreement and intended to use Enteris s Peptelligence technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize oral difelikefalin. In light of decision to discontinue the development of oral difelikefalin, it is possible that the Enteris License Agreement will be terminated. If we decide to resume development of oral difelikefalin in the future, if the Enteris License Agreement has been terminated or, for any other reason, we experience any interruptions in the manufacture, delivery or scale-up of the Enteris formulation technology, we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of oral difelikefalin. Further, if we are unable to maintain our relationship with Enteris, we may be forced to reformulate oral difelikefalin which could result in significantly delaying commercializing oral difelikefalin and require us to incur additional costs in connection with such reformulation and potentially needed to seek additional approvals from the FDA. The operations of our third-party manufacturers have been and, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, may in the future be constrained or disrupted and their operating capacity may be reduced by public health crises, such as pandemics or other similar outbreaks, which could negatively impact our clinical development and commercialization timelines. In addition, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, any manufacturers must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products and product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory 

 74 

Table of Contents 
 authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, regulatory agencies subject an approved product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer s facilities to continual review and inspections, including periodic unannounced inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with our current or any future approved products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where our current or any future approved products are manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of our current or any such future approved products, up to and including withdrawal of the affected product from the market. We have little control over our manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products and product candidate or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products and any product candidate, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, if approved. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension, delay or denial of product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and any potential future product candidates. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, even if we obtain regulatory approvals for such product candidate, they may never be successfully launched or become profitable, in which case our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be materially harmed. In order to successfully launch a product and have it become profitable, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we anticipate that we will have to dedicate substantial time and resources. Our ability to generate revenues from any commercialized products will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: achievement of broad market acceptance and coverage by government and third-party payers for our product; our or our partners effectiveness in marketing and selling our product; our ability to have manufactured commercial quantities of our product at acceptable cost levels and in compliance with regulatory requirements; our ability to maintain a cost-efficient organization and, to the extent we seek to do so, to collaborate successfully with additional third parties; our ability to expand and maintain intellectual property protection for our product successfully; the efficacy and safety of our product; and our ability to comply with regulatory requirements, which are subject to change. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization efforts, we may not be able to achieve profitability. For example, we previously successfully developed KORSUVA injection through regulatory approval, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adults undergoing hemodialysis. However, this product failed to achieve meaningful commercial success. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. A failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.

 If we or our collaborators are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities, or if we are unable to enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product and, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, any product candidate, if they are approved, we may be unable to generate product revenues. We currently do not have an internal commercial infrastructure for the marketing, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, in order to commercialize any such product candidate (if approved) in the United States, we will need to build our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and there are significant risks involved in the building and managing of a commercial infrastructure to the extent we choose to do so in the future. The establishment and development of our own sales force and related plans to market any products in the United States we may develop will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability. Should we resume development activities in the future, if oral difelikefalin or any future product candidate is approved for marketing outside of the United States, we intend to make and maintain arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We, or our partners or collaborators, will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, manage and retain marketing and sales personnel. In the event that we or our partners or our collaborators are unable to develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize any potential future product candidate, which would limit our ability to generate product revenues. Factors that may inhibit our or our partners or collaborators efforts to commercialize any potential future product candidate, if approved, include: inability to recruit, train, manage and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians and other providers or educate adequate numbers of physicians and other providers on the benefits of prescribing the product; inability to effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team; the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. Our or our partners or our collaborators sales force and marketing teams may not be successful in commercializing any approved product candidate that may receive regulatory approval. For example, we previously partnered with CSL Vifor for the commercialization of KORSUVA injection, but that product has not achieved meaningful commercial success. In the event that we are unable to successfully collaborate with a third-party marketing and sales organization to commercialize any approved product candidate outside the United States, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited. To the extent that we rely on third parties to commercialize products for which we obtain regulatory approval, we may receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other research organizations. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product, KORSUVA injection and, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, we will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and 

 76

 biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of pruritus. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Among the companies that currently market or are developing therapies in the pruritus space that, if approved, our oral difelikefalin would potentially compete with include: Pfizer, AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Amgen, Regeneron, Leo Pharma, Galderma, Chugai, Incyte and others. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than our product or any future product candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, generic products may be approved or used in clinical practice in some markets for the indication that such product candidate is intended to treat. We expect that any potential future product candidates, if approved, would be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products, if any. Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in R D, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient recruitment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. We face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, may have to limit commercialization of a product candidate. We face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the sale of our products to, use of our products by, and testing of any product candidate in, seriously ill patients. For example, product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. We may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: loss of revenue from decreased demand for our products and/or any potential product candidate; impairment of our business reputation or financial stability; costs of related litigation; substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; diversion of management attention and scientific resources from our business operations;

 withdrawal of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs; the inability to successfully commercialize our products and/or any potential product candidate; significant negative media attention; initiation of investigations by regulators or increased regulatory scrutiny; product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; and the inability to commercialize any potential product candidate. 
 Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, for any product candidate that is approved for commercial sale, we will be highly dependent upon healthcare provider and patient perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from patients use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our products and our clinical trials with a 15.0 million annual aggregate coverage limit in the United States and various other coverage limits outside of the United States. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products for our product candidate in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing, or at all. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on our product candidate or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we have focused on developing product candidates for specific indications that we believed to be most likely to succeed, in terms of both regulatory approval and commercialization. As a result, we may have foregone or delayed, or, should we resume development activities in the future, may in the future forgo or delay, pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential. For example, in 2023, we terminated the atopic dermatitis program as part of our strategy to focus on our advanced chronic kidney disease and NP programs. Further, in January 2024, we announced a prioritization of our pipeline to focus our resources on our late-stage clinical program evaluating oral difelikefalin in chronic pruritus associated with NP and terminate our Phase 3 clinical program evaluating oral difelikefalin in pruritus associated with advanced chronic kidney disease. In June 2024, we discontinued the clinical program in NP following the outcome from the dose-finding Part A of the KOURAGE-1 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients with NP in which oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit at any dose compared to placebo. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Should we resume development activities in the future, our spending on future R D programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through 

 78 

Table of Contents 
 collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Our future growth may depend on our ability to identify and develop products and, should we resume development activities in the future, if we do not successfully identify and develop product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities. Should we resume development activities in the future, our business strategy may require that we develop a product that we believe is a strategic fit with our focus on pruritus therapeutics. However, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including: difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development; disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention; higher than expected development costs; exposure to unknown liabilities; difficulty in managing multiple clinical trials; and inability to successfully develop new products or clinical failure. 
 We have limited resources to identify and execute the development of products. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential developments that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates, we may not be able to obtain product revenues in future periods. The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. Should we resume development activities in the future, if we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required additional regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize any product candidates as expected, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, it is possible that none of such potential product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA, and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing that product candidate. Should we resume development activities in the future, we expect we would continue to rely on third-party CROs, other vendors, and consultants to assist us in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate s safety and efficacy for that indication. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities.

 Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of any product candidates, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Should we resume development activities in the future, future clinical trial results may not be successful. We may also experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize any product candidates, including: regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites; clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; the number of patients required for clinical trials of any product candidate may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; we may have to suspend clinical trials, or terminate clinical trials of any potential product candidate for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; changes in marketing approval policies during the development period; changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations; changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application; the cost of clinical trials of our product candidate may be greater than we anticipate; the supply or quality of our product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of any potential product candidate may be insufficient or inadequate; and any potential product candidate may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials. 
 In addition, unfavorable changes in our industry or the global economy, including as a result of macroeconomic factors related to fluctuations in inflation and interest rates, political turmoil, or public health crises such as pandemics or other similar outbreaks, could contribute to some of the events listed above and should we resume development activities in the future further impact our ability to progress any future clinical trials, submit for marketing approval or 

 80 

Table of Contents 
 commercialize any product candidates, if approved, as planned. Further, if and to the extent, global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process any additional regulatory submissions we may make, which could affect our ability to obtain marketing approval for any potential product candidate. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of a product candidate or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may: be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for any potential product candidate; not obtain marketing approval at all; obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings; be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval. 
 Furthermore, regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies, including with respect to third-party technology used in any potential product candidates. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Finally, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of these scenarios could compromise the commercial prospects for a product candidate to assure safe use of the product candidate, either as a condition of product candidate approval or on the basis of new safety information. If we experience delays in obtaining approval, if we fail to obtain approval of a product candidate or if the label for a product candidate does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, the commercial prospects for such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, such product candidate, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including any requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS. If a product candidate receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug, which could limit sales of the product. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA and other regulatory authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved 

 81 

Table of Contents 
 indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other regulatory authorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or equivalent regulations outside the United States relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown AEs or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including: restrictions on the products, manufacturers, manufacturing facilities or manufacturing process; imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product; restrictions on product distribution or use; requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; warning letters; withdrawal of the products from the market; refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; recall of products and publicity requirements; fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals; refusal to permit the import or export of our products; product seizure, detentions or import bans or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA s or other regulatory authorities policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of any product candidates should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained. Regulatory approval is limited by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, and we may be subject to fines, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, resulting in damage to our reputation and business. When the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities issue regulatory approval for a product candidate, the regulatory approval is limited to those specific indications for which a product is approved. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products and product candidates, should we resume 

 82 

Table of Contents 
 development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, we are prohibited from marketing and promoting the products for indications that are not specifically approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. These off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries generally do not restrict or regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on off-label use. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities determine that our or our commercial partners promotional activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our promotional materials. Further, off-label promotion could subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions by the FDA and other authorities, including issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdraw an approved product from the market, mandatory or voluntary recalls, civil fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could significantly harm our business. Should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent a product candidate from being marketed abroad. In order to market and sell products in the EU and many other jurisdictions, we or our collaborators or partners must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. Even if we obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, the regulatory approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our or our collaborators or partners ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We or our collaborators or partners may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. Our agreements with HCR contain various covenants and other provisions, which, if violated, could materially adversely affect our financial condition. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we, through Cara Royalty Sub, entered into the HCR Agreement with HCR, pursuant to which Cara Royalty Sub sold, or agreed to sell, to HCR the Royalties under the Covered License Agreements, in exchange for up to 40.0 million. We have retained all of our right, title and interest in, to and under the Covered License Agreements that relate to any non-intravenous formulation of difelikefalin. Under the terms of the HCR Agreement, Cara received an initial payment of 17.5 million in November 2023. In December 2023, we received an additional 20.0 million less certain advisory fees, upon satisfying the milestone event for pricing for Kapruvia (difelikefalin) in Germany being approved above a certain threshold amount per dose. The terms of the HCR Agreement also provide for an additional 2.5 million milestone payment to Cara Royalty Sub upon achievement of a 2024 sales milestone of KORSUVA in Japan. As of the date of this filing, we expect to achieve this milestone in the fourth quarter of 2024. The HCR Agreement will automatically expire, and the payment of Royalties to HCR will cease, when HCR has received payments of Royalties equal to two times the aggregate amount of payments made by HCR under the HCR Agreement if achieved on or prior to December 31, 2029, or 2.8 times the aggregate amount of payments made by HCR under the HCR Agreement, if the 2029 Threshold is not achieved on or prior to December 31, 2029. In the event of a 

 83 

Table of Contents 
 change of control, Cara Royalty Sub will pay to HCR an amount equal to 2.8 times the aggregate amount of payments made by HCR less the total net amounts paid by Cara Royalty Sub to HCR as of the effective date of control. In certain situations, Cara Royalty Sub would not be obligated to pay the change of control payment to HCR. After the HCR Agreement expires, all rights to receive the Royalties return to Cara Royalty Sub. In connection with the HCR Agreement, we entered into a Contribution and Servicing Agreement which contains various representations and warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations and other provisions related to the contribution of the Covered License Agreement to Cara Royalty Sub and our maintenance and servicing obligations with respect to the Royalties and the Covered License Agreements. In the event we violate these covenants or provisions, we may lose the right to act as the servicer of Cara Royalty Sub and a third-party servicer may be appointed at Cara Royalty Sub s expense. Our replacement as servicer, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition as HCR, by virtue of owning Cara Royalty Sub, would own the Royalties. In connection with the HCR Agreement we also entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement containing various representations, warranties and covenants, and a limited recourse guaranty of Cara Royalty Sub s obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement which is secured by the pledge in favor of HCR all of the capital stock of Cara Royalty Sub. HCR is entitled to foreclose on the capital stock of Cara Royalty Sub following the occurrence of certain remedies events, including, without limitation, a bankruptcy of us or the failure of us to perform our obligations under the Contribution and Servicing Agreement. Such foreclosure, if it were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition as HCR, by virtue of owning Cara Royalty Sub, would own the Royalties. Our information systems, or those of others upon whom we rely (such as our CROs, contract manufacturers, contractors, consultants, service providers, collaborators and others) may fail or suffer cybersecurity breaches, loss or leakage of data or other disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs, compromise sensitive information related to our business, or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability that could adversely affect our business. We are increasingly dependent upon information systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, transmit and otherwise process confidential information (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal data). We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of service providers who have access to our data and information systems and infrastructure. Our reliance on service providers could introduce new cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to our business operations. We rely on service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive data in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and authentication technology, personnel email, and other functions. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide other products, services, parts, or otherwise to operate our business. Our ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners supply chains have not been compromised. Cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions, especially as personnel are working remotely, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states and other external parties. To the extent that any disruption or cybersecurity breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or information systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and reputational damage and, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, the further development of such product candidates could be delayed. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During 

 84 

Table of Contents 
 times of war and other major conflicts, we, and the third parties upon which we rely, may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyberattacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services. In particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, ability to provide our products or services, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. We and the third parties upon which we rely are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Additionally, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information systems (such as our hardware and/or software, including that of third parties upon which we rely). We may not, however, detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities including on a timely basis. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address identified vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result in a security incident. Any of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive data or our information technology systems, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our services. We may expend significant resources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive data. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and investors, of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, such as government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management attention; interruptions in our operations (including development and commercialization of any product candidate, should we resume development activities in the future, if approved, and availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may prevent or cause customers to stop using our services, deter new customers from using our services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business. Our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data 

 85

 privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties Any collaboration arrangements that we are a party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and ultimately commercialize our product candidate or any potential future product candidate. Our business model in the past has been to develop and commercialize product candidates in the United States and generally to seek collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of product candidate in the rest of the world. We currently have license agreements with Maruishi and CKDP for the intravenous and oral formulations of difelikefalin, as well as license agreements with respect to our commercially approved products, KORSUVA Injection and Kapruvia with CSL Vifor. In addition to our existing agreements, we may enter into additional collaboration arrangements in the future on a selective basis. Our existing collaborations and future collaboration arrangements may not be successful. The success of our existing and future collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaboration arrangements. Disagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority. Collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Maruishi may terminate its agreement with us at will, and CKDP may terminate its agreement with us in certain circumstances relating to patent invalidity or unenforceability or generic entry by a third party, as further described in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Collaboration and License Agreements . Any such termination or expiration could adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation. Our current collaborations and any future collaborations we might enter into, including related to development of our product candidate or any future product candidate should we resume development activities in the future, may pose a number of risks, including the following: collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected; collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product or product candidate that achieves regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators strategic focus or available funding that divert resources or create competing priorities; collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; collaborators could fail to make timely regulatory submissions for a product or product candidate; collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements or may fail to report safety data in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements; collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; 

 86 

Table of Contents 
 product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of any potential product candidates; a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our products or product candidate that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of products and product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to products and product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive; collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and collaborations, including our collaboration with Maruishi, may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate. 
 If our current collaborations or any other collaborations we might enter into in the future, including related to development of our product candidate or any future product candidate should we resume development activities in the future, do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of potential product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop a product candidate and our product platform. All of the risks relating to our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also apply to the activities of our collaborators in their respective jurisdictions. Additionally, if any current or future collaborator of ours, including related to development of our product candidate or any future product candidate should we resume development activities in the future, is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our reputation in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. If we determine to collaborate in the future with additional pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of oral difelikefalin or any potential future product candidate, should we resume development activities in the future, we would face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to 

 87 

Table of Contents 
 us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform or successfully commercialize our products and our business may be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Legal and Compliance Matters If we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, and transparency laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency and patients rights may be applicable to our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability, and our partners and collaborators ability, to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulates, among other things, our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase, recommendation, lease, order or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including without limitation the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties law, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment or approval from a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid); Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; and state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;

 state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to the pricing of certain drugs, as well as payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies continue to be prosecuted under the federal false claims laws for numerous activities, including those related to research, sales, marketing and promotional programs. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes. As a result, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, imprisonment, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state transparency and fraud and abuse laws may prove costly. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business, including our partners or collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but not limited to, exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business. We are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards, contracts, industry standards, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation (including class claims) and mass arbitration demands, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue and profits, and otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. We are subject to or affected by numerous domestic (both federal and state) and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, contracts, industry standards, policies and other obligations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and other processing of personal data, such as information that we collect about participants and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. Obligations related to data privacy and security (and consumers data privacy expectations) are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. This evolving global data protection landscape may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our service providers ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use, share and otherwise personal data, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these obligations is high and is likely to increase in the future and may necessitate changes to our operations and to those of third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.

 In the United States, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, including health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, certain healthcare providers, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information. In the event we are subject to HIPAA and we or our business associates or subcontractors fail to properly maintain the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information, or we or our business associates or subcontractors are responsible for an inadvertent disclosure or security breach of such individually identifiable health information, we could be subject to enforcement measures, including civil and criminal penalties and fines for violations of state and federal privacy or security standards, such as HIPAA and HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations. Additionally, certain states have adopted their own privacy and security laws and regulations for health information, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states, following California s enactment of the CCPA - including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah-have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. To the extent that we are or may become subject to these laws, the exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels, and we expect more states to pass similar laws in the future. These state laws may allow for statutory fines for noncompliance (for example, under the CCPA, fines can be levied up to 7,500 per intentional violation) and private rights of action. While some of these laws may exempt some data processed in the context of clinical trials, these developments further complicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us, and the third parties upon whom we rely. For example, Washington s My Health My Data Act MHMD broadly defines consumer health data, places restrictions on processing consumer health data (including imposing stringent consent requirements), provides consumers certain rights with respect to their health data, and creates a private right of action to allow individuals to sue for violations of the law. Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards govern data privacy and security. For example, the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR impose strict requirements for processing personal data. GDPR may increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and otherwise process personal data. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health conditions, may also be subject to heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR. Under the GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million Euros under the EU GDPR, 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR or, in each case, 4 of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. In addition, we may be unable to transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws it generally believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA s standard contractual clauses, the UK s International Data Transfer Agreement/Addendum, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework), these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the 

 90 

Table of Contents 
 EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions to the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions (such as Europe) at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activities groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers of personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR s cross-border data transfer limitations. In addition to data privacy and security laws, we are or may become contractually subject to industry standards adopted by industry groups. We are also bound by other contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences. We may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy and security obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands; additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; orders to destroy or not use personal data; and imprisonment of company officials. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; interruptions or stoppages in our business operations (including, as relevant, clinical trials should we resume development activities in the future); inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations. We are subject to recent legislation, regulatory proposals and healthcare payer initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our ability to market our products, obtain collaborators and raise capital. In March 2010, President Obama signed the Health Care Reform Law, which includes provisions that have changed, and likely will continue to change, health care financing and the delivery of health care in the United States. The Health Care Reform Law, among other things, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs, required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations, required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts (increased to 70 percent, effective as of January 1, 2019) off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.

 There have been executive, judicial, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Health Care Reform Law is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Health Care Reform Law marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021, and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Health Care Reform Law. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Health Care Reform Law marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the donut hole under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is also unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Health Care Reform Law and our business. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. These changes include, among other things, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year, which went effective on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2032, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100 of a drug s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is considering additional health reform measures. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. We expect that the Health Care Reform Law, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for KORSUVA injection or any approved product candidate, should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. In addition, there have been several recent U.S. Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100 of a drug s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023. On August 29, 2023, HHS announced the list of the first ten drugs that will be subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. It is unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. In response to the Biden administration s October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the CMS Innovation Center which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future.

 Further, on December 7, 2023, the Biden administration announced an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs through the use of march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the price of a product as one factor an agency can use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that will continue under the new framework. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida s Section 804 Importation Program (SIP) proposal to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this program will be implemented, including which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the United States or Canada. Other states have also submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. Any such approved importation plans, when implemented, may result in lower drug prices for products covered by those programs. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be, should we resume development activities in the future. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Legislation and regulations that, among other things, reduce drug prices or require the implementation of costly compliance measures could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts, and we cannot predict what legislation will be enacted in the future. Governments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any. In international markets, reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In some countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. Should we resume development activities in the future, to obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Our employees, independent contractors, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by such individuals could include inadvertent or intentional failures to: comply with FDA regulations and other similar foreign regulations; 

 93 

Table of Contents 
 provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; comply with manufacturing standards; comply with federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the United States and similar foreign laws; report financial information or data accurately; or disclose unauthorized activities to us. 
 In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, including off label uses of our products, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs, patient assistance programs, and other business arrangements generally. Third party misconduct could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Our business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business. Our third-party manufacturers and suppliers activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us. We and any third-party manufacturers and suppliers we engage are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air and water; and employee health and safety. Our partners operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our contract manufacturers facilities pending their use and disposal. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability 

 94 

Table of Contents 
 could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, product development and manufacturing efforts. Risks Related to Intellectual Property It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and as a result we may not be able to ensure their protection and all patents will eventually expire. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for difelikefalin and, should we resume development activities in the future, for any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire and the methods we use to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents and trade secrets against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute to issuance all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we may fail to identify patentable aspects of our R D output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, should we enter into additional collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be successfully prosecuted to issuance and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. Moreover, the patent application process is also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting difelikefalin and, should we resume development activities in the future, any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire by obtaining and defending patents. For example: we may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents; we may not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our product candidates or technologies; it is possible that none of the pending patent applications will result in issued patents; the issued patents covering our product candidates may not provide a basis for commercially viable active products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties; we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; 

 95 

Table of Contents 
 competitors may file trademark infringement claims or challenges to the validity of our trademark(s); noncompliance with governmental patent agencies requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction, potentially allowing competitors to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case; our competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates; or there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of available patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns. 
 Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent Office has developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, including and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our currently pending and future patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Patent applications in the United States are generally maintained in confidence for at least 18 months after their earliest effective filing date and in certain circumstances not until granted when no foreign counterpart patent applications are filed. Furthermore, published patent applications may issue at a later date with new and/or amended claims substantially different from those published earlier. Consequently, we cannot be certain we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on difelikefalin or, should we resume development activities in the future, any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire. Until recent changes to the U.S. Patent Laws, patents and patent applications relating to substantially similar claimed inventions were potentially subject to interference proceedings to determine the first applicant to invent the claimed subject matter. For an interference to be declared against our patents and patent applications, any such interference would be under the 1952 law which was eliminated by the America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in 2011 and fully effective in 2013. Such an interference would therefore have to relate to a patent or application with an effective filing date before March 16, 2013. No interference with such a patent or application has been declared to date. Therefore, it seems extremely unlikely that we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States against one or more parties claiming the same or similar invention. However, in the unlikely event that such interference was to be declared, the costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. The results of these types of proceedings could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the patentability of claims in pending patent applications covering KORSUVA injection or other difelikefalin-based product can be challenged by third parties during prosecution in the USPTO under the new AIA law

 of 2013, for example by third party observations and derivation proceedings, and the validity of claims in issued patents can be challenged by third parties in various post-grant proceedings such as Post-Grant Review, Inter-partes Reexamination, and Inter-partes Review proceedings. Furthermore, we may not have identified all U.S. and foreign patents or published applications that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or by covering similar technologies that affect our drug market. In addition, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans, and in these countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our product candidates. Even if patents issue, we cannot guarantee that the claims of those patents will be valid and enforceable or provide us with any significant protection against competitive products, or otherwise be commercially valuable to us. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our licensors, employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for difelikefalin or, should we resume development activities in the future, any other product candidate that we may develop, license or acquire, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. If we or any current or future collaboration partner are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business. Our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell difelikefalin or, should we resume development activities in the future, any potential future product candidate will depend upon our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and our commercial success will depend upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the general field of pain management and cover the use of numerous compounds and formulations in our targeted markets. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Because of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other litigation involving proprietary rights, we and our licensors may not be successful in defending intellectual property claims by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. In addition, 

 97 

Table of Contents 
 because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that current or potential future product candidates may infringe. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that our current or potential future product candidates may inadvertently infringe. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third-party claims that we infringe on their products or technology, we could face a number of issues, including: infringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, can be expensive and time consuming to litigate and can divert management s attention from our core business; substantial damages for past infringement which we may have to pay if a court decides that our product infringes on a competitor s patent; a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which it would not be required to do; if a license is available from a patent holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents; and redesigning our processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time. 
 If we are found to infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidate or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Competitors may infringe on our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Most of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, should we resume development activities in the future, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring any product candidate to market.

 We may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could materially harm our business. We may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees, or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidate, should we resume development activities, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. The validity and enforceability of the patents and applications that cover difelikefalin can be challenged by competitors. Should we resume development activities in the future, in the event that oral difelikefalin or any potential future product candidate is approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the patents covering these products and product candidates, which could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims. For example, if a third party files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a generic drug product containing difelikefalin, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (2) the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (3) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third-party s generic drug product. A 

 99 

Table of Contents 
 certification that the new product will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for difelikefalin, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third-party s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third-party s ANDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third-party s ANDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management s attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products. Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed. In January 2024, as part of our pipeline prioritization, we reduced our headcount by approximately 50 , including the separation of our former Chief Scientific Officer and SVP of Research Development. Further, in June 2024, in connection with our streamlined operating plan, we further reduced our headcount by approximately 70 . As of the date of this filing, we have ten employees that are currently working for us. Although we believe these employee transitions are in the best interest of our company and our stockholders, these transitions may result in the loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge. Further, the transition could potentially disrupt our operations and relationships with employees, suppliers, and partners and, as a result, create added costs, operational inefficiencies, decreased employee morale and productivity and increased turnover. In addition, our competitors may seek to use these transitions and the related potential disruptions to gain a competitive advantage over us. Furthermore, these changes increase our dependency on the remaining members of our leadership team and clinical and preclinical operations teams that remain with us, who are not contractually obligated to remain employed with us and may leave at any time. Any such departure could be particularly disruptive and, to the extent we experience additional turnover, competition for top talent is high such that it may take some time to find a candidate that meets our requirements. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, scientific, and clinical personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy. If we lose additional members of our senior management team, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed. Replacing these employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate additional key personnel. We do not maintain key person insurance for any of our executives or other employees. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, in the past, we have also been required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis as a large accelerated filer. However, based on our public float as of June 30, 2023, we qualified as a non-accelerated filer at the end of 2023, which 

 100 

Table of Contents 
 would allow us to forgo the auditor attestation requirement for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. However, we voluntarily complied with the auditor attestation requirement for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Further, we may in the future discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Moreover, our internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. Moreover, we are aware that the increased prevalence of remote working arrangements potentially presents additional areas of risk, including cyber and privacy risks, and we are carefully monitoring any impact to our internal controls and procedures. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock If we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may be delisted and the price of our common stock, our ability to access the capital markets and our financial condition could be negatively impacted. Our common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol CARA. To maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, maintaining a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share. On February 1, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq, notifying us that, for the previous 30 consecutive business day period prior to the date of the letter, the closing bid price for our common stock was below 1.00. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until July 30, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq s bid price requirement. On July 31, 2024, we received the Extension Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq informing us that Nasdaq granted us an additional 180 calendar days, or until January 27, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the Rule. In connection with the Extension Notice, the listing of our common stock was transferred from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, effective as of August 1, 2024. If we are not able to regain compliance within this additional compliance period offered by Nasdaq, we could be delisted, which would have a further material adverse effect on market prices of our common stock and stockholder liquidity. If at any time before January 27, 2025, the closing bid price of our common stock is at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written confirmation that we have achieved compliance with the Rule, unless Nasdaq staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10-day period pursuant to Nasdaq rules. We intend to actively monitor the bid price of our common stock and will consider available options to regain compliance with the listing requirement. These options include, but are not limited to, effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary, to attempt to regain compliance. Separately, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain shareholders equity of at least 2.5 million, or the Shareholders Equity Requirement, or the alternative requirements of having a market value of listed securities of 35.0 million or net income from continuing operations of 0.5 million in the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years, or the Alternative Standards. As of September 30, 2024, we had shareholders equity of 0.7 million and therefore are not in compliance with the Shareholders Equity Requirement and, as of September 30, 2024, we did not meet the Alternative Standards. If we continue to not be in compliance or if we fail to meet other Nasdaq continuing listing requirements, our common 

 101 

Table of Contents 
 stock may be subject to delisting, and we may become subject to delisting proceedings. We are currently assessing our available options to regain compliance with the Shareholders Equity Requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the listing requirements above or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria. If the Nasdaq Capital Market delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant negative consequences including: reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, delisting from Nasdaq may negatively impact our reputation and, consequently, our business. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. Since our initial public offering in January 2014, our stock price has been volatile and it is likely that the trading price of our common stock will continue to be volatile. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: the outcome of our exploration of strategic alternatives; actual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results; failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public; failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community, including securities analysts; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or divestitures; introduction of competitive products or technologies; the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community; general trends in our industry or economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets; developments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply, warehousing and inventory control; disputes or other developments relating to patents or other proprietary rights; additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us; capital commitments; investors general perception of our company and our business; announcements and expectations of additional financing efforts, including the issuance of debt, equity or convertible securities or other security instruments; 

 102 

Table of Contents 
 sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or significant stockholders; changes in the market valuations of companies similar to us; should we resume development activities in the future, (i) changes or developments in laws or regulations applicable to such product candidate;(ii) delays in the commencement, enrollment and ultimate completion of any clinical trials; (iii)results of any clinical trials or those of our competitors; or (iv)any delay or refusal on the part of the FDA or other regulatory authorities in approving marketing authorization for any potential product candidate; changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and the other factors described in this Risk Factors section. 
 In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors, such as those related to fluctuations in inflation and interest rates and concerns of a recession in the United States or other major markets, the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, and geopolitical instability, including resulting from the ongoing conflicts between Russia and the Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and increasing tensions between China and Taiwan, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Further, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business. If equity research analysts cease to publish research or reports about us or if they publish unfavorable research or reports about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is likely to be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. Certain equity research analysts who covered us have ceased coverage, and if further analysts who cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. We expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including: our exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including whether we are able to identify and implement any strategic alternatives, in a timely manner or at all, whether we realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of any such transaction and whether any such transactions would generate value for our stockholder; should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, the successful progress of any clinical trials for such product candidates; should we resume development of activities in the future, variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs; 

 103 

Table of Contents 
 should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, whether the FDA or other regulatory authorities require us to complete additional, unanticipated studies, tests or other activities prior to approving any product candidates, which would likely further delay any such approval; should we resume development of our product candidate or any future product candidate, our ability to identify, enter into and maintain third party manufacturing arrangements capable of manufacturing any potential product candidate in commercial quantities; our execution of other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements; any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved; regulatory developments affecting any potential product candidates, or the product candidates of our competitors; and if any potential product candidate receives regulatory approval, the level of underlying demand for such product and wholesaler buying patterns. 
 If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. Entry into an acquisition, merger, business combination, or other strategic transaction, or raising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. In June 2024, we announced that we are undertaking a comprehensive exploration of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. The terms of any strategic transaction that we might enter could result in the issuance of securities in the company, such as our common stock, which could result significant dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, in connection with such strategic alternatives, we may seek to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, royalty arrangements, grants, license and development agreements in connection with any collaborations, and other financial instruments. We do not yet have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic transactions, collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, product candidate or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Any debt financing that we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments. The use of our net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits may be limited. A portion of our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and R D tax credits may expire and not be used. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately 467.0 million and 473.3 million, respectively, and we also had federal and state R D tax credit carryforwards of approximately 27.5 million and 4.5 million, respectively. Our NOL carryforwards will begin expiring in 2026 for federal purposes (to the extent such federal NOLs are generated in taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017) and 2027 for state purposes if we have 

 104 

Table of Contents 
 not used them prior to that time, and our federal R D tax credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously used. The federal NOLs arising in 2018 and forward have an unlimited carryforward period and losses from 2018-2020 may be carried back five years due to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, or the CARES Act. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act. To the extent that we have not exchanged our Connecticut R D tax credits for a tax refund, those tax credits carry forward indefinitely. Additionally, our ability to use any NOL and R D tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or tax, respectively, in the future will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, respectively, if we have a cumulative change in ownership of our stock of more than 50 within a three-year period. The completion of our initial public offering in 2014 and our follow-on public offerings in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019, together with private placements and other transactions that have occurred, may have triggered such ownership changes. We conducted a 382 analysis in the first quarter of 2021. This analysis showed a limited change of ownership had occurred, and the amount of NOL carryforwards and R D tax credits that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income or tax, respectively. In addition, since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo ownership changes in the future. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the NOL carryforwards and R D tax credits before they expire. In addition, certain states have in the past suspended use of NOL carryforwards for certain taxable years (including Connecticut which currently limits the use of NOL carryforwards by 50 and California, which recently enacted legislation that temporarily suspends the use of California NOLs for three years beginning on or after January 1, 2024), and other states are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, limitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards in states in which we are subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Changes to existing tax laws, or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The tax regimes to which we are subject or under which we operate are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. The issuance of additional guidance related to existing or future tax laws, or changes to tax laws or regulations proposed or implemented by the current or a future U.S. presidential administration, Congress, or taxing authorities in other jurisdictions could materially affect our tax obligations. For example, beginning in 2022, the TCJA eliminated the option to deduct R D expenditures in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to capitalize and subsequently amortize such expenditures over five years for research activities conducted in the United States and over 15 years for research activities conducted outside the United States. In January 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, which would retroactively repeal for 2022 and 2023, and defer until 2026, the requirement to capitalize R D expenditures for research activities conducted in the United States. Uncertainty exists as to whether the bill will be enacted into law. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws are extremely complex and subject to various interpretations. Although we believe that our tax estimates and positions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities. If the relevant tax authorities assess additional taxes on us, this could result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Because we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, your returns will be limited to any increase in the value of our stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, if any. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.

 Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result. There are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including: our Board of Directors are divided into three classes, with only one class of directors elected each year; our stockholders are entitled to remove directors only for cause upon a 66 2/3 vote; our stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent; our stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting of stockholders; and our stockholders must give us advance notice of their intent to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings. 
 In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities . None. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. . Amendment to Bylaws On November 13, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ), effective immediately, to reduce the quorum requirement for stockholder meetings from a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote to one-third of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote. The Amended and Restated Bylaws are filed herewith as Exhibit 3.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.

ARTICLE II CORPORATE SEAL Section 3. Corporate Seal. The Board of Directors may adopt a corporate seal. The corporate seal shall consist of a die bearing the name of the corporation and the inscription, Corporate Seal-Delaware. Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise. ARTICLE III STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS Section 4. Place Of Meetings. Meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Section 5. Annual Meetings. (a) The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for the purpose of election of directors and for such other business as may properly come before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of 
 -1- 

stockholders: (i) pursuant to the corporation s notice of meeting of stockholders (with respect to business other than nominations); (ii) brought specifically by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving the stockholder s notice provided for in Section 5(b) below, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in Section 5. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (iii) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations and submit other business (other than matters properly included in the corporation s notice of meeting of stockholders and proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the 1934 Act )) before an annual meeting of stockholders. (b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as is a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law and as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. (i) For nominations for the election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 5(a) of these Bylaws, the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(b)(iii) and must update and supplement such written notice on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(c). Such stockholder s notice shall set forth: (A) as to each nominee such stockholder proposes to nominate at the meeting: (1) the name, age, business address and residence address of such nominee, (2) the principal occupation or employment of such nominee, (3) the class and number of shares of each class of capital stock of the corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by such nominee, (4) the date or dates on which such shares were acquired and the investment intent of such acquisition, (5) a statement whether such nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person s failure to receive the required vote for election or re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, and (6) such other information concerning such nominee as would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such nominee as a director in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or that is otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 14 of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including such person s written consent to being named as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (B) the information required by Section 5(b)(iv). The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such proposed nominee. (ii) Other than proposals sought to be included in the corporation s proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14(a)-8 under the 1934 Act, for business other than nominations for the election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 5(a) of these Bylaws, the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(b)(iii), and must update and supplement such written notice on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(c). Such stockholder s notice shall set forth: (A)

as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any material interest (including any anticipated benefit of such business to any Proponent (as defined below) other than solely as a result of its ownership of the corporation s capital stock, that is material to any Proponent individually, or to the Proponents in the aggregate) in such business of any Proponent; and (B) the information required by Section 5(b)(iv). (iii) To be timely, the written notice required by Section 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(ii) must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90 th day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120 th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting; provided, however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 5(b)(iii), in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to or delayed by more than thirty (30) days after the anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120 th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90 th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10 th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall an adjournment or a postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given, or the public announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above. (iv) The written notice required by Section 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(ii) shall also set forth, as of the date of the notice and as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a Proponent and collectively, the Proponents ): (A) the name and address of each Proponent, as they appear on the corporation s books; (B) the class, series and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by each Proponent; (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether oral or in writing) with respect to such nomination or proposal between or among any Proponent and any of its affiliates or associates, and any others (including their names) acting in concert, or otherwise under the agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any of the foregoing; (D) a representation that the Proponents are holders of record or beneficial owners, as the case may be, of shares of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting and intend to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(i)) or to propose the business that is specified in the notice (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(ii)); (E) a representation as to whether the Proponents intend to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a sufficient number of holders of the corporation s voting shares to elect such nominee or nominees (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(i)) or to carry such proposal (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(ii)); (F) to the extent known by any Proponent, the name and address of any other stockholder supporting the proposal on the date of such stockholder s notice; and (G) a description of all Derivative Transactions (as defined below) by each Proponent during the previous twelve (12) month period, including the date of the transactions and the class, series and number of securities involved in, and the material economic terms of, such Derivative Transactions. 
 -3- 

For purposes of Sections 5 and 6, a Derivative Transaction means any agreement, arrangement, interest or understanding entered into by, or on behalf or for the benefit of, any Proponent or any of its affiliates or associates, whether record or beneficial: (w) the value of which is derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares or other securities of the corporation, (x) which otherwise provides any direct or indirect opportunity to gain or share in any gain derived from a change in the value of securities of the corporation, (y) the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit of security value or price changes, or (z) which provides the right to vote or increase or decrease the voting power of, such Proponent, or any of its affiliates or associates, with respect to any securities of the corporation, which agreement, arrangement, interest or understanding may include, without limitation, any option, warrant, debt position, note, bond, convertible security, swap, stock appreciation right, short position, profit interest, hedge, right to dividends, voting agreement, performance-related fee or arrangement to borrow or lend shares (whether or not subject to payment, settlement, exercise or conversion in any such class or series), and any proportionate interest of such Proponent in the securities of the corporation held by any general or limited partnership, or any limited liability company, of which such Proponent is, directly or indirectly, a general partner or managing member. (c) A stockholder providing written notice required by Section 5(b)(i) or (ii) shall update and supplement such notice in writing, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice is true and correct in all material respects as of (i) the record date for the meeting and (ii) the date that is five (5) business days prior to the meeting and, in the event of any adjournment or postponement thereof, five (5) business days prior to such adjourned or postponed meeting. In the case of an update and supplement pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5(c), such update and supplement shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting. In the case of an update and supplement pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5(c), such update and supplement shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than two (2) business days prior to the date for the meeting, and, in the event of any adjournment or postponement thereof, two (2) business days prior to such adjourned or postponed meeting. (d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5(b)(iii) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors in an Expiring Class is increased and there is no public announcement of the appointment of a director to such class, or, if no appointment was made, of the vacancy in such class, made by the corporation at least ten (10) days before the last day a stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance with Section 5(b)(iii), a stockholder s notice required by this Section 5 and which complies with the requirements in Section 5(b)(i), other than the timing requirements in Section 5(b)(iii), shall also be considered 
 -4- 

timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions in such Expiring Class created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. For purposes of this section, an Expiring Class shall mean a class of directors whose term shall expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders. (e) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director unless the person is nominated either in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5(a), or in accordance with clause (iii) of Section 5(a). Except as otherwise required by law, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made, or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, or the Proponent does not act in accordance with the representations in Sections 5(b)(iv)(D) and 5(b)(iv)(E), to declare that such proposal or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nominations or such business may have been solicited or received. (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholders meeting, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to proposals and/or nominations to be considered pursuant to Section 5(a)(iii) of these Bylaws. (g) For purposes of Sections 5 and 6, (i) public announcement shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act; and (ii) affiliates and associates shall have the meanings set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act ). Section 6. Special Meetings. (a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose as is a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law, by (i) the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer, or (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for adoption). 
 -5- 

(b) The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place, if any, of such special meeting. Upon determination of the time and place, if any, of the meeting, the Secretary shall cause a notice of meeting to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in the notice of meeting. (c) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers written notice to the Secretary of the corporation setting forth the information required by Section 5(b)(i). In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder of record may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation s notice of meeting, if written notice setting forth the information required by Section 5(b)(i) of these Bylaws shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90 th day prior to such meeting or the tenth (10 th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. The stockholder shall also update and supplement such information as required under Section 5(c). In no event shall an adjournment or a postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, or the public announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 6. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations for the election to the Board of Directors to be considered pursuant to Section 6(c) of these Bylaws. Section 7. Notice Of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice, given in writing or by electronic transmission, of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, if any, date and hour, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at any such meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the corporation. Notice of the time, place, if any, and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof, or by electronic transmission by such person, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the 
 -6- 

express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. Section 8. Quorum. At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise required by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of one-third (1/3) of the voting power of the issued outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairperson of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by statute or by applicable stock exchange rules, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, except where otherwise required by the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, one-third (1/3) of the issued and outstanding shares of such class or classes or series, present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of directors) of shares of such class or classes or series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes or series. Section 9. Adjournment And Notice Of Adjourned Meetings. Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairperson of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if any, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Section 10. Voting Rights. For the purpose of determining those stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date, as provided 
 -7- 

in Section 12 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with Delaware law. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Section 11. Joint Owners Of Stock. If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the DGCL, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest. Section 12. List Of Stockholders.

The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or executive officer, of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director or executive officer in his or her capacity as a director or executive officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this section or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, 
 -20- 

whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. (d) Enforcement. Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this section to a director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. To the extent permitted by law, the claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this section or otherwise shall be on the corporation. (e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or 
 -21- 

agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law. (f) Survival of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive officer or officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. (g) Insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this section. (h) Amendments. Any repeal or modification of this section shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation. (i) Saving Clause. If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this section that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this section shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable law. (j) Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following definitions shall apply: (i) The term proceeding shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. (ii) The term expenses shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, court costs, attorneys fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or kind incurred in connection with any proceeding. (iii) The term the corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this section with respect to the resulting or surviving 
 -22- 

corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. (iv) References to a director , executive officer , officer , employee , or agent of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as, respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. (v) References to other enterprises shall include employee benefit plans; references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the corporation shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the corporation as referred to in this section. ARTICLE XII NOTICES Section 45. Notices. (a) Notice To Stockholders. Written notice to stockholders of stockholder meetings shall be given as provided in Section 7 herein. Without limiting the manner by which notice may otherwise be given effectively to stockholders under any agreement or contract with such stockholder, and except as otherwise required by law, written notice to stockholders for purposes other than stockholder meetings may be sent by US mail or nationally recognized overnight courier, or by facsimile, telegraph or telex or by electronic mail or other electronic means. (b) Notice To Directors. Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), as otherwise provided in these Bylaws with notice other than one which is delivered personally to be sent to such address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known address of such director. (c) Affidavit Of Mailing. An affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, or other agent, specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, or director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same, shall in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained. (d) Methods of Notice. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all recipients of notice, but one permissible method may 
 -23- 

be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others. (e) Notice To Person With Whom Communication Is Unlawful. Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. (f) Notice to Stockholders Sharing an Address. Except as otherwise prohibited under DGCL, any notice given under the provisions of DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Such consent shall have been deemed to have been given if such stockholder fails to object in writing to the corporation within sixty (60) days of having been given notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice. Any consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENTS Section 46. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 44(h) of these Bylaws or the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the corporation by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders also shall have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the corporation required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3 of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. ARTICLE XIV LOANS TO OFFICERS Section 47. Loans To Officers.

 -24- 

a director of the corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, such loan, guarantee or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guarantee or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.
