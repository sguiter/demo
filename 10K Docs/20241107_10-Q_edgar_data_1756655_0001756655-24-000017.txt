 York Stock Exchange under the symbol ARDT . 
 On July 17, 2024, in connection with the IPO and immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Company's registration 
 statement on Form S-1, the Company converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation by 
 means of a statutory conversion (the Corporate Conversion and changed its name to Ardent Health Partners, Inc. As a 
 result of the Corporate Conversion, the outstanding limited liability company membership units and vested profits interest 
 units were converted into shares of common stock and outstanding unvested profits interest units were converted 
 into shares of restricted common stock. Immediately following the Corporate Conversion, ALH Holdings, LLC, a 
 subsidiary of Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas"), a common unit holder that beneficially owned a percentage of the Company s 
 outstanding membership interests and maintained a seat on the Company s board of managers, making Ventas a related party, 
 contributed all of its outstanding common stock in AHP Health Partners, Inc. ("AHP Health Partners"), a direct subsidiary of 
 the Company, to Ardent Health Partners, Inc. in exchange for shares of common stock of Ardent Health Partners, 
 Inc. (the "ALH Contribution"). As a result of the ALH Contribution, AHP Health Partners is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
 Ardent Health Partners, Inc. The Corporate Conversion and the ALH Contribution have been retrospectively applied to prior 
 periods herein for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share. The Company s certificate of 
 incorporation authorizes shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock, each with a

 received and recognized million of government stimulus income. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Update ASU 
 2021-10, Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance , as an accounting policy election, the Company has 
 utilized International Accounting Standards IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government 
 Assistance, by analogy to recognize funds received under the CARES Act from the Provider Relief Fund as revenue, given no

 adjustments resulted in changes to net patient service revenue of an increase of million and million for the three 
 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and an increase to net patient service revenue of million and 
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company s settlements under reimbursement agreements with third- 
 party payors were a net payable of million and million , respectively, of which a receivable of million and 
 million , respectively, was included in other current assets and a payable of million and million , 
 respectively, was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Final determination of amounts earned under prospective payment and other reimbursement activities is subject to review by 
 appropriate governmental authorities or their agents. In the opinion of the Company s management, adequate provision has 
 been made for any adjustments that may result from such reviews. 
 Subsequent adjustments that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the patient s or the payor s ability to pay 
 are recognized as bad debt expense. Bad debt expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 
 not material to the Company. 
 Currently, several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs for the purpose of providing reimbursement to 
 providers to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed 
 with input from the Center for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS and are funded with a combination of state and 
 federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the providers. Under these supplemental programs, 
 the Company recognizes revenue and related expenses in the period in which amounts are estimable and collection is

The Company provides care without charge to certain patients who qualify under the local charity care policy of the hospital 
 where the patient receives services. The Company estimates that its costs of care provided under its charity care programs 
 approximated million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The 
 Company estimates that its costs of care provided under its charity care programs approximated million and 
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company does not report a charity care 
 patient s charges in revenue as it is the Company s policy not to pursue collection of amounts related to these patients, and 
 therefore contracts with these patients do not exist. 
 The Company s management estimates its costs of care provided under its charity care programs utilizing a calculated ratio of 
 costs to gross charges multiplied by the Company s gross charity care charges provided. The Company s gross charity care 
 charges include only services provided to patients who are unable to pay and qualify under the Company s local charity care 
 policies. To the extent the Company receives reimbursement through the various governmental assistance programs in which 
 it participates to subsidize its care of indigent patients, the Company does not include these patients charges in its cost of 
 care provided under its charity care program.

Payments from the Program are received at different points of time during a funding year. Differences between original 
 estimates and subsequent revisions to the payments, including final settlements, represent changes in the estimate and are 
 recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. Subsequent adjustments to the payments received and the 
 Company s related estimates have historically been insignificant. The Company recognized revenue of million and 
 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the senior secured term loan facility reflected an original issue discount 
 OID of million and million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Senior 
 Notes balance reflected an OID of million and million , respectively . 
 Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 On August 24, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement for its senior secured term loan facility (the " Term Loan B 
 Facility"), which provides funding up to a principal amount of million . The Term Loan B Facility has a 
 maturity with principal due in consecutive equal quarterly installments of of the initial million principal 
 amount (subject to certain reductions from time to time as a result of the application of prepayments), with the remaining 
 balance due upon maturity of the Term Loan B Facility. The proceeds from the Term Loan B Facility were used to prepay in 
 full the Company's million senior secured term loan facility (the "2018 Term Loan B Facility"), including any accrued 
 and unpaid interest, fees and other expenses related to the transaction. On June 8, 2023, the Company further amended and 
 restated the Term Loan B Facility credit agreement (the "Term Loan B Credit Agreement") to replace LIBOR with the Term 
 Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the amended Term Loan B Credit 
 Agreement) as the reference interest rate effective June 30, 2023. On June 26, 2024, the Company used cash on hand to 
 prepay million of the million outstanding principal on the Term Loan B Facility; no modification was made to 
 the Term Loan B Credit Agreement as a result of this prepayment. On September 18, 2024, the Company executed an 
 amendment to reprice its Term Loan B Credit Agreement. The repricing reduced the applicable interest rate by basis 
 points from Term SOFR plus to Term SOFR plus and eliminated the credit spread adjustment. No 
 modifications were made to the maturity of the loans as a result of the repricing and all other terms were substantially 
 unchanged. 
 Effective July 8, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated senior credit agreement for its million 
 senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Agreement ). The ABL Credit Agreement consisted of a 
 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with a maturity. On April 21, 2023, the Company 
 further amended and restated the ABL Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR with the Term SOFR and Daily Simple SOFR 
 (each, as defined in the amended ABL Credit Agreement) as the reference interest rate. On June 26, 2024, the Company 
 further amended the ABL Credit Agreement to increase the revolving commitment to million and extend its maturity 
 date to June 26, 2029. 
 The Term Loan B Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement contain a number of customary affirmative and negative 
 covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to (subject, in each case, to a number of 
 important exceptions, thresholds and qualifications as set forth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and ABL Credit 
 Agreement): 
 incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations); 
 incur liens; 
 make certain investments; 
 make certain dispositions and engage in certain sale / leaseback transactions; 
 make certain payments or other distributions; and

to 1.00, as determined at the end of each fiscal quarter. Management 
 believes that, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company maintained more than the minimum amount of 
 availability under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and, therefore, the minimum fixed charge ratio 
 described herein was not applicable.

 million and expiring August 31, 2023. Under 
 the amended agreements, the Company was required to make monthly fixed rate payments at annual rates ranging from 
 to , and the counterparties were obligated to make monthly floating rate payments to the Company based on 
 one-month LIBOR, each subject to a floor of . 
 On October 8, 2021, the Company executed new interest rate swap agreements (the October 2021 Agreements with 
 Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America, N.A. as counterparties, with notional amounts totaling million and an 
 effective date of August 31, 2023 and expiring June 30, 2026. Under the October 2021 Agreements, the Company was 
 required to make monthly fixed rate payments at annual rates ranging from to , and the counterparties were 
 obligated to make monthly floating rate payments to the Company based on one-month LIBOR, each subject to a floor of 
 . Effective August 31, 2023, the Company amended the October 2021 Agreements to adjust the fixed rates and replace 
 the LIBOR floating interest rate options with Term SOFR floating rate options. Under the amended October 2021 
 Agreements, the Company is required to make monthly fixed rate payments at annual rates ranging from to , 
 and the counterparties are obligated to make monthly floating rate payments to the Company based on one-month Term 
 SOFR, each subject to a floor of . 
 The Company accounts for its interest rate swap agreements in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Because 
 the interest rate swap agreements amended on August 26, 2021 did not meet the definition of derivatives in their entirety due 
 to the financing element of the agreements, the Company accounted for these as hybrid instruments that consisted of a debt 
 instrument (debt host) and an embedded at-market derivative. At August 26, 2021, the debt portion of the hybrid instruments 
 was equal to the fair value of the existing interest rate swap agreements, and the balance within AOCI associated with the 
 debt portion was amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the remaining effective period of the amended 
 agreements, which expired August 31, 2023. The at-market derivative portion of each hybrid instrument was designated as a 
 cash flow hedge with changes in fair value included in AOCI as a component of equity. Amounts were subsequently 
 reclassified from AOCI into interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affected earnings. 
 Cash interest payments associated with the at-market derivative portion of the hybrid instruments were classified as operating

 it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions will change in the coming 12 months as a result of being 
 within the applicable statute of limitations with respect to uncertain tax positions.

putative class actions were filed against the 
 Company in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee: Burke v. AHS Medical Holdings LLC, No. 3:23- 
 cv-01308; Redd v. AHS Medical Holdings, LLC, No. 3:23-cv-01342; and Epperson v. AHS Management Company, Inc., 
 No. 3:24-cv-00396. These cases were consolidated by the District Court on April 24, 2024, under the caption Hodge v. AHS 
 Management Company, Inc., No. 3:23-cv-01308 (M.D. Tenn.). The complaint for the consolidated class action, filed on 
 behalf of approximately individuals who allege their personal information and protected health information were 
 affected by the Cybersecurity Incident, generally asserts state common law claims of negligence, breach of implied contract, 
 unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and invasion of privacy with respect to how the Company managed sensitive 
 data. On October 4, 2024, the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated class action litigation. 
 On October 9, 2024, the District Court preliminarily approved the settlement and set the hearing for the District Court s final 
 approval of the settlement for August 1, 2025. Settlement of the consolidated case on the agreed terms will require the 
 Company to make cash settlement payments that will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, 
 financial position or liquidity. 
 Acquisitions 
 The Company has acquired, and plans to continue to acquire, businesses with prior operating histories. Acquired companies 
 may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, 
 such as billing and reimbursement, fraud and abuse and anti-kickback laws. The Company has from time to time identified 
 certain past practices of acquired companies that do not conform to its standards. Although the Company institutes policies 
 designed to conform such practices to its standards following completion of acquisitions, there can be no assurance that the 
 Company will not become liable for the past activities of these acquired facilities that may later be asserted to be improper by 
 private plaintiffs or government agencies. Although the Company generally seeks to obtain indemnification from prospective 
 sellers covering such matters, there can be no assurance that any such matter will be covered by indemnification or, if 
 covered, that such indemnification will be adequate to cover potential losses and fines.

Recent D evelopments 
 Term Loan B Facility Repricing 
 On September 18, 2024, we executed an amendment to reprice our Term Loan B Facility credit agreement (the "Term Loan 
 B Credit Agreement"). The repricing reduced the applicable interest rate by 50 basis points from Term SOFR plus 3.25 to 
 Term SOFR plus 2.75 and eliminated the credit spread adjustment. No modifications were made to the maturity of the 
 loans as a result of the repricing and all other terms were substantially unchanged. 
 Initial Public Offering and Corporate Conversion 
 On July 19, 2024, we completed an initial public offering of 12,000,000 shares of our common stock (the "IPO"), at a public 
 offering price of 16.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of 192.0 million and net proceeds of approximately 
 181.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 10.6 million . The IPO provided 
 the underwriters with an option to purchase up to an additional 1,800,000 shares of our common stock, which was fully 
 exercised by the underwriters, and, on July 30, 2024, we issued 1,800,000 additional shares of common stock at 16.00 per 
 share for additional net proceeds of approximately 27.2 million , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 
 approximately 1.6 million . Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ARDT . 
 On July 17, 2024, in connection with the IPO and immediately prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement on 
 Form S-1, we converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation by means of a statutory 
 conversion (the Corporate Conversion and changed our name to Ardent Health Partners, Inc. As a result of the Corporate 
 Conversion, the outstanding limited liability company membership units and vested profits interest units were converted into 
 120,937,099 shares of common stock and outstanding unvested profits interest units were converted into 2,848,027 shares of 
 restricted common stock. Immediately following the Corporate Conversion, ALH Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Ventas, Inc. 
 ("Ventas"), contributed all of its outstanding common stock in AHP Health Partners, Inc. ("AHP Health Partners"), our direct 
 subsidiary, to Ardent Health Partners, Inc. in exchange for 5,178,202 shares of common stock of Ardent Health Partners, Inc. 
 (the "ALH Contribution"). The Corporate Conversion and the ALH Contribution have been retrospectively applied to prior 
 periods herein for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share. Our certificate of incorporation 
 authorizes 750,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a 0.01 par value per 
 share. 
 ABL Credit Agreement Amendment and Term Loan B Facility Prepayment 
 On June 26, 2024, we executed an amendment to our ABL Credit Agreement to increase the revolving commitment by 
 100.0 million to 325.0 million and extend the maturity date to June 26, 2029. Concurrent with the execution of this 
 amendment on June 26, 2024, we also prepaid 100.0 million of the outstanding principal on our Term Loan B Facility. The 
 100.0 million prepayment was applied in direct order of maturities of future payments, and no modification was made to the 
 Term Loan B Facility as a result of this prepayment. 
 2024 Supplemental Payment Program Updates 
 A new Oklahoma directed payment program (the Oklahoma DPP became effective on April 1, 2024. Under the Oklahoma 
 DPP, hospitals receive directed payments in accordance with Oklahoma s new Medicaid managed care delivery system, 
 resulting in reimbursement near the average commercial rate. The existing upper payment limit component of Oklahoma s 
 Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program will remain in place for certain categories of Medicaid patients that continue 
 to be enrolled in Oklahoma s traditional Medicaid Fee for Service program. We have recognized total revenue of 48.6 
 million under the Oklahoma DPP from the April 1, 2024 effective date through September 30, 2024. 
 In March 2024, New Mexico s Healthcare Delivery and Access Act (the New Mexico HDA Act was signed into law. 
 Subject to approval by the Center for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS ), the New Mexico HDA Act would provide 
 directed payments for hospitals that serve patients in New Mexico s Medicaid managed care delivery system, resulting in 
 reimbursement near the average commercial rate, and once approved, is expected to represent a material rate uplift for us.

The directed payment program under the New Mexico HDA Act was submitted to CMS for approval on August 5, 2024, with 
 a requested effective date of July 1, 2024. The program is still under CMS review. 
 We believe the preliminary estimate of our net benefit under the Oklahoma DPP and the New Mexico HDA Act to be in 
 excess of 150 million on an annualized basis, subject to change, non-recurrence, and adjustment for potential quality 
 performance requirements. 
 Cybersecurity Incident 
 In November 2023, we determined that a ransomware cybersecurity incident had impacted and disrupted a number of our 
 operational and information technology systems (the Cybersecurity Incident ). Upon detecting the ransomware, we quickly 
 activated our incident response protocols and implemented a series of containment and remediation measures, including 
 engaging the services of cybersecurity experts and incident response professionals. We also promptly launched an 
 investigation, engaged external counsel to support the investigation and involved federal and state law enforcement. During 
 this time, our hospitals remained operational and continued to deliver patient care utilizing established downtime procedures; 
 however, we advised local EMS systems and other providers to divert emergency ambulance transports to other facilities for 
 a few days until the Cybersecurity Incident had been contained. As a result of our investigation, we determined that the 
 unauthorized actor acquired a copy of certain personal information and protected health information of a limited number of 
 our patients and personal information of certain of our employees, but did not gain access to our EHR platform. We have 
 cooperated with law enforcement authorities that have made inquiries into the Cybersecurity Incident, and we have been in 
 contact with, and complied with, the requirements of various governmental authorities that require notification of such 
 incidents. Additionally, because of the time taken to contain and remediate the Cybersecurity Incident, our online electronic 
 billing systems were not functioning at their full capacities and certain billing, reimbursement and payment functions were 
 delayed. 
 We estimate the Cybersecurity Incident had an adverse pre-tax impact of approximately 74 million during the year ended 
 December 31, 2023. This estimate includes lost revenue from the associated business interruption and costs to remediate the 
 issue, net of insurance proceeds. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, we also experienced decreases in 
 admissions, surgeries (both inpatient and outpatient) and emergency room visits of 2.5 , 2.1 and 5.7 , respectively, 
 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, which, prior to the Cybersecurity Incident, were estimated to have 
 increased by 4.1 , 5.5 and 3.3 , respectively, compared to the same period in 2022. While our operations were no longer 
 materially disrupted as of September 30, 2024 , we continued to experience delays in billing claims and obtaining 
 reimbursements and payments through the first quarter of 2024 , and will incur certain expenses related to the Cybersecurity 
 Incident, including expenses to defend claims brought by individuals and other expenses related to the Cybersecurity 
 Incident. On October 4, 2024, we executed a settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated class action litigation. On 
 October 9, 2024, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement and set the hearing for the Court s final approval of the 
 settlement for August 1, 2025. Settlement of the consolidated case on the agreed terms will require us to make cash 
 settlement payments that will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 Pure Health Equity Investment 
 On May 1, 2023, an affiliate of Pure Health Holding PJSC Pure Health purchased an equity interest representing 25.0 
 of the total combined voting power of Ardent Health Partners, LLC from the unit holders at the time for approximately 500 
 million. In connection with Pure Health s investment, unit holders were eligible to exercise tag-along rights to sell a 
 proportionate share of their individual equity ownership interest in Ardent Health Partners, LLC and AHP Health Partners, 
 our direct subsidiary. Ventas, a common unit holder that beneficially owned a percentage of our outstanding membership 
 interests and maintained a seat on our board of managers, making Ventas a related party, exercised its tag-along right to sell 
 its proportionate share of interest in both Ardent Health Partners, LLC and AHP Health Partners. Ventas sold approximately 
 24 of its ownership interest in Ardent Health Partners, LLC for 24.2 million in total cash proceeds. Additionally, to fulfill 
 Ventas right to sell its proportionate share of noncontrolling ownership interest in AHP Health Partners, we exercised our 
 right to repurchase those shares from Ventas for 26.0 million concurrent with Pure Health s purchase of a minority interest 
 in Ardent Health Partners, LLC. The carrying value of Ventas noncontrolling interest was adjusted proportionate to the 
 shares repurchased to reflect the change in ownership of AHP Health Partners, with the difference between the fair value of 
 the consideration paid and the amount by which noncontrolling interest was adjusted recognized in equity attributable to 
 Ardent Health Partners, LLC. As of September 30, 2024 , following the consummation of the IPO and the underwriters'

 Key Factors Impacting Our Results of Operations 
 Staffing and Labor Trends 
 Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such 
 as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in 
 recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our 
 hospitals and other facilities, including nurses and other non-physician healthcare professionals. At times, the availability of 
 nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue for healthcare providers, including at 
 certain of our facilities. The impact of labor shortages across the healthcare industry may result in other healthcare facilities, 
 such as nursing homes, limiting admissions, which may constrain our ability to discharge patients to such facilities and 
 further exacerbate the demand on our resources, supplies and staffing. 
 We contract with various third parties who provide hospital-based physicians. Third-party providers of hospital-based 
 physicians, including those with whom we contract, have experienced significant disruption in the form of regulatory 
 changes, including those stemming from enactment of the No Surprises Act, challenging labor market conditions resulting 
 from a shortage of physicians and inflationary wage-related pressures, as well as increased competition through consolidation 
 of physician groups. In some instances, providers of outsourced medical specialists have become insolvent and unable to 
 fulfill their contracts with us for providing hospital-based physicians. The success of our hospitals depends in part on the 
 adequacy of staffing, including through contracts with third parties. If we are unable to adequately contract with providers, or 
 the providers with whom we contract become unable to fulfill their contracts, our admissions may decrease, and our operating 
 performance, capacity and growth prospects may be adversely affected. Further, our efforts to mitigate the potential impact 
 on our business from third-party providers who are unable to fulfill their contracts to provide hospital-based physicians, 
 including through acquisitions of outsourced medical specialist businesses, employment of physicians and re-negotiation or 
 assumption of existing contracts, may be unsuccessful. These developments with respect to providers of outsourced medical 
 specialists, and our inability to effectively respond to and mitigate the potential impact of such developments, may disrupt our 
 ability to provide healthcare services, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we 
 operate. In some of our markets, employers across various industries have increased minimum wages, which has created 
 more competition and, in some cases, higher labor costs for this sector of employees. 
 Seasonality 
 We typically experience higher patient volumes and revenue in the fourth quarter of each year in our acute care facilities. We 
 typically experience such seasonal volume and revenue peaks because more people generally become ill during the winter 
 months, which in turn results in significant increases in the number of patients we treat during those months. In addition, 
 revenue in the fourth quarter is also impacted by increased utilization of services due to annual deductibles, which are not 
 usually met until later in the year, and patient utilization of their healthcare benefits before they expire at year-end. 
 Inflation 
 The healthcare industry is labor intensive. Wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor 
 shortages occur in the marketplace. In addition, our suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices. We 
 have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses. We have generally offset 
 increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services, expanding services and reducing costs in other areas. 
 However, we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases, particularly any increases in our cost of 
 providing health insurance benefits to our employees.

Geographic Data 
 The information below provides an overview of our operations in certain markets as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Texas . We operated 13 acute care hospital facilities (including one managed hospital that is owned by The University of 
 Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, an affiliate of The University of Texas System) with 1,436 licensed beds that serve the 
 areas of Tyler, Amarillo and Killeen, Texas. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we generated 36.4 of our total 
 revenue in the Texas market. 
 Oklahoma . We operated eight acute care hospital facilities with 1,173 licensed beds that serve the area of Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we generated 24.8 of our total revenue in the Oklahoma market. 
 New Mexico . We operated five acute care hospital facilities with 619 licensed beds that serve the areas of Albuquerque and 
 Roswell, New Mexico. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we generated 14.6 of our total revenue in the New 
 Mexico market. 
 New Jersey . We operated two acute care hospital facilities with 476 licensed beds that serve the areas of Montclair and 
 Westwood, New Jersey. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we generated 10.2 of our total revenue in the New 
 Jersey market. 
 Other Industry Trends 
 The demand for healthcare services continues to be impacted by the following trends: 
 A growing focus on healthcare spending by consumers, employers and insurers, who are actively seeking lower-cost 
 care solutions; 
 A shift in patient volumes from inpatient to outpatient settings due to technological advancements and demand for 
 care that is more convenient, affordable and accessible; 
 The growing aged population, which requires greater chronic disease management and higher-acuity treatment; and 
 Ongoing consolidation of providers and insurers across the healthcare industry. 
 Additionally, the healthcare industry, particularly acute care hospitals, continues to be subject to ongoing regulatory 
 uncertainty. Changes in federal or state healthcare laws, regulations, funding policies or reimbursement practices, especially 
 those involving reductions to government payment rates or limitations on what providers may charge, could significantly 
 impact future revenue and operations. For example, the No Surprises Act prohibits providers from charging patients an 
 amount beyond the in-network cost sharing amount for services rendered by out-of-network providers, subject to limited 
 exceptions. For services for which balance billing is prohibited, the No Surprises Act includes provisions that may limit the 
 amounts received by out-of-network providers from health plans. Any reduction in the rates that we can charge or amounts 
 we can receive for our services will reduce our total revenue and our operating margins. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Revenue and Volume Trends 
 Our revenue depends upon inpatient occupancy levels, ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and 
 provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges and negotiated payment rates for such services. 
 Total revenue is comprised of net patient service revenue and other revenue. We recognize patient service revenue in the 
 period in which we provide services. Patient service revenue includes amounts we estimate to be reimbursable by Medicare, 
 Medicaid and other payors under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas in effect. The amounts we receive 
 from these payors are generally less than the established billing rates, and we report patient service revenue net of these 
 differences (contractual adjustments) at the time we render the services. We also report patient service revenue net of the 
 effects of other arrangements where we are reimbursed for services at less than established rates, including certain self-pay 
 adjustments provided to uninsured patien ts. We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on 

28

historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenue at the estimated amount expected to 
 be collected. 
 Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 72.1 million , or 5.2 , compared to the same prior 
 year period. The increase in total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an increase in adjusted 
 admissions of 3.8 and an increase in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission of 0.9 . The increase in adjusted 
 admissions was primarily driven by growth in admissions of 6.4 compared to the same prior year period. Outpatient 
 surgeries increased 0.2 compared to the same prior year period. Outpatient surgery growth was limited, in part, by ongoing 
 service line optimization efforts that resulted in strategic reallocation of resources from high volume, low margin procedures, 
 such as certain dental, otolaryngology and ophthalmology procedures, to alternate higher margin service lines. The increase 
 in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission was attributable to a combination of a favorable payor mix and 
 improved service mix as a result of ongoing service line optimization efforts, partially offset by a decrease in supplemental 
 funding as compared to the same prior year period. 
 Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 296.3 million , or 7.3 , compared to the same prior 
 year period. The increase in total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an increase in adjusted 
 admissions of 3.5 and an increase in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission of 3.6 . The increase in a djusted 
 admissions reflected growth in admissions of 5.6 , partially offset by a decrease in outpatient surgeries of 1.7 compared to 
 the same prior year period, driven, in part, by ongoing service line optimization efforts that resulted in strategic reallocation 
 of resources from high volume, low margin procedures, such as certain dental, otolaryngology and ophthalmology 
 procedures, to alternate higher margin service lines. The increase in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission was 
 attributable to a combination of a favorable payor mix, improved service mix as a result of ongoing service line optimization 
 efforts, and an increase in supplemental funding as compared to the same prior year period. 
 A key competitive strength and a significant component of our growth strategy has been our well-established and 
 differentiated JV model, which has resulted in partnerships with premier academic medical centers, large not-for-profit 
 hospital systems, community physicians, and a community foundation. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 and 2023 , total revenue related to these JVs was 429.9 million and 394.8 million , respectively, which represented 29.7 
 and 28.7 , respectively, of our total revenue for such periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , 
 total revenue related to these entities was 1,281.0 million and 1,203.4 million , respectively, which represented 29.4 and 
 29.6 , respectively, of our total revenue for such periods.

(1) Hospitals operated (at period end). This metric represents the total number of hospitals operated by us at the end of the applicable period, irrespective of 
 whether the hospital real estate is (i) owned by us, (ii) leased by us or (iii) held through a controlling interest in a JV. This metric includes the managed clinical 
 operations of the hospital at UT Health North Campus in Tyler, Texas UT Health North Campus Tyler ), a hospital owned by The University of Texas Health 
 Science Center at Tyler UTHSCT ), an affiliate of The University of Texas System. Since we only manage the clinical operations of UT Health North 
 Campus Tyler, the financial results of such entity are not consolidated under Ardent Health Partners, Inc. 
 On April 30, 2024, we closed UT Health East Texas Specialty Hospital, a long-term acute care hospital (the LTAC Hospital in Tyler, Texas. The LTAC 
 Hospital's inventory and fixed assets were transferred or repurposed to be used by our other hospitals. The LTAC Hospital had 36 licensed patient beds and 
 accounted for approximately 0.0 million and 2.2 million of total revenue and a pre-tax loss of 0.2 million and 0.5 million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and approximately 2.4 million and 8.0 million of total revenue and a pre-tax loss of 0.8 million and 0.5 million 
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 (2) Licensed beds (at period end). This metric represents the total number of beds for which the appropriate state agency licenses a facility, regardless of whether 
 the beds are actually available for patient use. 
 (3) Utilization of licensed beds. This metric represents a measure of the actual utilization of our inpatient facilities, computed by (i) dividing patient days by the 
 number of days in each period, and (ii) further dividing that number by average licensed beds, which is calculated by dividing total licensed beds (at period end) 
 by the number of days in the period, multiplied by the number of days in the period the licensed beds were in existence. 
 (4) Admissions. This metric represents the number of patients admitted for inpatient treatment during the applicable period. 
 (5) Adjusted admissions. This metric is used by management as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Adjusted admissions provides 
 management with a key performance indicator that considers both inpatient and outpatient volumes by applying an inpatient volume measure (admissions) to a 
 ratio of gross inpatient and outpatient revenue to gross inpatient revenue. Gross inpatient and outpatient revenue reflect gross inpatient and outpatient charges 
 prior to estimated contractual adjustments, uninsured discounts, implicit price concessions, and other discounts. The calculation of adjusted admissions is 
 summarized as follows: 
 Adjusted Admissions = Admissions x Gross Inpatient Revenue + Gross Outpatient Revenue) 
 Gross Inpatient Revenue 
 (6) Inpatient surgeries. This metric represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management, c- 
 sections, and certain diagnostic procedures are excluded from inpatient surgeries. 
 (7) Outpatient surgeries. This metric represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have not been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management, c- 
 sections, and certain diagnostic procedures are excluded from outpatient surgeries. 
 (8) Emergency room visits. This metric represents the total number of patients provided with emergency room treatment during the applicable period. 
 (9) Patient days. This metric represents the total number of days of care provided to patients admitted to our hospitals during the applicable period. 
 (10) Total encounters. This metric represents the total number of events where healthcare services are rendered resulting in a billable event during the applicable 
 period. This includes both hospital and ambulatory patient interactions. 
 (11) Average length of stay. This metric represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals. 
 (12) Net patient service revenue per adjusted admission. This metric represents net patient service revenue divided by adjusted admissions for the applicable 
 period. Net patient service revenue reflects gross inpatient and outpatient charges less estimated contractual adjustments, uninsured discounts, implicit price 
 concessions, and other discounts.

Overview of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 72.1 million , or 5.2 , compared to the same prior 
 year period. The increase in total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an increase in adjusted 
 admissions of 3.8 and an increase in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission of 0.9 . The increase in adjusted 
 admissions was primarily driven by growth in admissions of 6.4 compared to the same prior year period. Outpatient 
 surgeries increased 0.2 compared to the same prior year period. Outpatient surgery growth was limited, in part, by ongoing 
 service line optimization efforts that resulted in strategic reallocation of resources from high volume, low margin procedures, 
 such as certain dental, otolaryngology and ophthalmology procedures, to alternate higher margin service lines. The increase 
 in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission was attributable to a combination of a favorable payor mix and 
 improved service mix as a result of ongoing service line optimization efforts, partially offset by a decrease in supplemental 
 funding as compared to the same prior year period. 
 Total operating expenses increased 61.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior 
 year period due to higher patient volumes but decreased 0.6 as a percentage of total revenue. The decrease in total operating 
 expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, was driven by decreases in other operating expenses and supplies, as percentages 
 of total revenue, compared to the same prior year period. The decrease in other operating expenses, as a percentage of total 
 revenue, was primarily attributable to reduced provider assessments associated with various governmental supplemental 
 revenue programs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease 
 in supplies expense, as a percentage of net revenue, was driven by ongoing service line optimization efforts. The decrease in 
 total operating expense, as a percentage of total revenue, was partially offset by an increase in professional fees, as a 
 percentage of total revenue, due to higher costs for hospital-based providers as well as increased costs for revenue cycle 
 management services due to increased cash collections during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the 
 same prior year period. 
 
 Overview of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 296.3 million , or 7.3 , compared to the same prior 
 year period. The increase in total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an increase in adjusted 
 admissions of 3.5 and an increase in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission of 3.6 . The increase in a djusted 
 admissions reflected growth in admissions of 5.6 compared to the same prior year period, partially offset by a decrease in 
 outpatient surgeries of 1.7 compared to the same prior year period, driven, in part, by ongoing service line optimization 
 efforts that resulted in strategic reallocation of resources from high volume, low margin procedures, such as certain dental, 
 otolaryngology and ophthalmology procedures, to alternate higher margin service lines. The increase in net patient service 
 revenue per adjusted admission was attributable to a combination of a favorable payor mix, improved service mix as a result 
 of ongoing service line optimization efforts, and an increase in supplemental funding as compared to the same prior year 
 period. 
 Total operating expenses increased 243.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior 
 year period due to higher patient volumes but decreased 1.0 as a percentage of total revenue. T he decrease in total operating 
 expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, was driven by decreases in salaries and benefits and supplies, as percentages of 
 total revenue, compared to the same prior year period. The decrease in salaries and benefits, as a percentage of total revenue, 
 was primarily due to a decrease in contract labor expense of 26.0 million d uring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 compared to the same prior year period . The decrease in supplies expense, as a percentage of total revenue, was driven by 
 ongoing service line optimization efforts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year 
 period. The decrease in total operating expense, as a percentage of total revenue, was partially offset by an increase in 
 professional fees, as a percentage of total revenue, driven by higher costs for hospital-based providers and an increase in costs 
 for revenue cycle management services due to increased cash collections during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 compared to the same prior year period. 
 
 Comparison of the Th ree Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total revenue Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 72.1 million , or 5.2 , compared

 Salaries and benefits Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of total revenue, were 43.8 for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 compared to 43.2 for the same prior year period. The increase in salaries and benefits, as a percentage 
 of total revenue, was driven by an increase in equity-based compensation of 8.0 million . 
 Professional fees Professional fees, as a percentage of total revenue, were 18.9 for the three months ended September 
 30, 2024 compared to 17.9 for the same prior year period. The increase in professional fees, as a percentage of total 
 revenue, reflected higher costs for hospital-based providers as well as increased expenses for revenue cycle management 
 services due to increased cash collections during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Supplies Supplies, as a percentage of total revenue, were 17.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared 
 to 18.1 for the same prior year period. The decrease in supplies, as a percentage of total revenue, was attributable to 
 ongoing service line optimization efforts and execution on various supply chain cost reduction initiatives, including improved 
 inventory management, standardized surgical supply procurement and strategic sourcing. 
 Rents and leases Rents and leases were 26.4 million and 24.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Rents and leases, related party Rents and leases, related party, consists of lease expense related to the Master Lease with 
 Ventas ("Ventas Master Lease"), under which we lease 10 of our facilities, and other lease agreements with Ventas for certain 
 medical office buildings. Rents and leases, related party were 37.2 million and 36.4 million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 Other operating expenses Other operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, were 8.2 for the three months 
 ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.1 for the same prior year period. Other operating expenses are comprised 
 primarily of repairs and maintenance, utility, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and provider assessments. 
 The change in other operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, was primarily driven by a decrease in provider 
 assessments associated with various governmental supplemental revenue programs during the three months ended September 
 30, 2024 , compared to the same prior year period. 
 Interest expense Interest expense was 14.6 million and 19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 
 2023 , respectively. 
 Loss on extinguishment and modification of debt On September 18, 2024, we executed an amendment to our Term Loan B 
 Credit Agreement . In connection with this transaction, we incurred a loss on the debt extinguishment of 0.3 million related 
 to the write-off of existing deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and transaction costs of 1.2 million related 
 to the modification of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Other non-operating gains Other non-operating gains were 2.8 million and 0.0 million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The increase in ot her non-operating gains was primarily due to the recognition of 
 insurance recovery proceeds of 2.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the Cybersecurity 
 Incident. 
 Income tax expense We recorded income tax expense of 11.1 million , which equates to an effective tax rate of 19.4 , for 
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 7.3 million , which equates to an effective 
 tax rate of 15.8 , for the same prior year period. The increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by an increase in 
 income before income taxes attributable to Ardent Health Partners, Inc., which resulted in an increase in taxes at the federal 
 statutory rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period. Additionally, the 
 effective tax rate was further impacted by permanent differences resulting from the disallowance of certain equity-based 
 compensation incurred during the during the three months ended September 30, 2024 .

N et income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 19.7 million for 
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.9 million for the same prior year period consisted primarily of 
 19.7 million and 17.0 million of net income attributable to minority partners interests in hospitals and ambulatory services 
 that are owned and operated though limited liability companies and consolidated by us for t he three months ended September 
 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Income from operations before income taxes related to these limited liability companies was 
 68.6 million and 60.3 million for t he three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The remaining 
 portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of net

 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total revenue Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 296.3 million , or 7.3 , compared 
 to the same prior year period. The increase in total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of an 
 increase in adjusted admissions of 3.5 and an increase in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission of 3.6 . The 
 increase in a djusted admissions reflected growth in admissions of 5.6 compared to the same prior year period. The growth 
 in admissions was partially offset by a decrease in outpatient surgeries of 1.7 compared to the same prior year period 
 driven, in part, by ongoing service line optimization efforts that resulted in strategic reallocation of resources from high 
 volume, low margin procedures, such as certain dental, otolaryngology and ophthalmology procedures, to alternate higher 
 margin service lines. The increase in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission was attributable to a combination of a 
 favorable payor mix, improved service mix as a result of ongoing service line optimization efforts, and an increase in 
 supplemental funding as compared to the same prior year period. 
 Salaries and benefits Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of total revenue, were 43.1 for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 compared to 44.0 for the same prior year period. The decrease in salaries and benefits, as a percentage 
 of total revenue, was primarily attributable to a decrease in contract labor expense of 26.0 million due to a combination of 
 reduced contract labor rates and lower utilization, driven by ongoing recruiting and retention initiatives. Total contract labor 
 expenses, as a percentage of total salaries and benefits, were 4.2 and 5.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 and 2023 , respectively.

 reflected higher costs for hospital-based providers as well as increased expenses for revenue cycle management services due 
 to increased cash collections during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Supplies Supplies, as a percentage of total revenue, were 17.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared

Supplemental Non-GAAP Information 
 We have included certain financial measures that have not been prepared in a manner that complies with U.S. generally 
 accepted accounting principles GAAP ), including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. We define these terms as 
 follows: 
 Performance Measure 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus (i) provision for income taxes, (ii) interest expense and (iii) 
 depreciation and amortization expense (or EBITDA), as adjusted to deduct noncontrolling interest earnings, and 
 excludes the effects of losses on the extinguishment and modification of debt; other non-operating losses (gains); 
 Cybersecurity Incident recoveries, net of incremental information technology and litigation costs; restructuring, exit 
 and acquisition-related costs; expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of Epic Systems Epic ), 
 our integrated health information technology system, equity-based compensation expense, and loss (income) from 
 disposed operations. See Supplemental Non-GAAP Performance Measure. 
 Valuation Measure 
 Adjusted EBITDAR is defined as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to add back rent expense payable to real 
 estate investment trusts ("REITs"), which consists of rent expense pursuant to the Ventas Master Lease, lease 
 agreements associated with the MOB Transactions (as defined below) and a lease arrangement with Medical 
 Properties Trust, Inc. ("MPT") for Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center. See Supplemental Non- 
 GAAP Valuation Measure. 
 Supplemental Non-GAAP Performance Measure 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP performance measure used by our management and external users of our financial 
 statements, such as investors, analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties, to evaluate companies in our 
 industry. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that is not defined under GAAP and is presented in this Quarterly Report 
 because our management considers it an important analytical indicator that is commonly used within the healthcare industry 
 to evaluate financial performance and allocate resources. Further, our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a 
 useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain material non-cash 
 items and unusual or non-recurring items that we do not expect to continue in the future and certain other adjustments we 
 believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and our performance. 
 Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to 
 other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 While we believe this is a useful supplemental performance measure for investors and other users of our financial 
 information, you should not consider the non-GAAP measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other items 
 calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has inherent material limitations as a performance measure, because 
 it adds back certain expenses to net income, resulting in those expenses not being taken into account in the performance 
 measure. We have borrowed money, so interest expense is a necessary element of our costs. Because we have material capital 
 and intangible assets, depreciation and amortization expense are necessary elements of our costs. Likewise, the payment of 
 taxes is a necessary element of our operations. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes these and other items, it has material 
 limitations as a measure of our performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from our operations and available 
 borrowings under our ABL Facilities (as defined below). Our primary cash requirements are our operating expenses, the 
 service of our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other healthcare facilities, 
 and distributions to noncontrolling interests. We believe the combination of cash flow from operations and available cash and 
 borrowings will be adequate to meet our short-term liquidity needs. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal, pay 
 interest on, or refinance, our indebtedness, pay distributions or fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to 
 generate cash in the future. This ability is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, 
 regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had total cash and cash equivalents of 563.1 million and available liquidity of 851.2 million . 
 Our available liquidity was comprised of 563.1 million of total cash and cash equivalents plus 288.1 million in available 
 capacity under the ABL Credit Agreement, which is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. In 
 June 2024, we amended the ABL Credit Agreement to increase commitments available thereunder by 100.0 million and 
 extended its maturity date to June 26, 2029. See "Senior Secured Credit Facilities" for additional information. At September 
 30, 2024 , our net leverage ratio, as calculated under our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan B Credit Agreement, was 
 1.6 x, and our lease-adjusted net leverage ratio was 3.5 x. Our lease adjusted net leverage is calculated as net debt as of 
 September 30, 2024 , plus 8.0x trailing twelve month REIT rent expense as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 , divided by 
 the trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDAR as of September 30, 2024 . 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we received and recognized 0.0 million and 8.5 million , 
 respectively, of cash distributions from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund Provider Relief Fund ), a 
 provision of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), and other state and local programs. 
 For additional information regarding distributions from the Provider Relief Fund and the CARES Act, refer to Note 2 to our 
 unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

 Capital Expenditures 
 We make significant, targeted investments to maintain and modernize our facilities, introduce new technologies, and expand 
 our service offerings. We expect to finance future capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds. Capital 
 expenditures for property and equipment were 106.2 million and 80.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Ventas Master Lease 
 Effective August 4, 2015, we sold the real property for ten of our hospitals to Ventas, which is a related party as, prior to our 
 IPO, it was a common unit holder of Ardent Health Partners, LLC and owned shares of common stock of AHP Health 
 Partners and had a representative serving on our board of managers. Concurrent with this transaction, we entered into a 20- 
 year master lease agreement that expires in August 2035 (with a renewal option for an additional ten years) to lease back the 
 real estate. We lease ten of our hospitals pursuant to the Ventas Master Lease. As of September 30, 2024 , following the 
 consummation of the IPO and the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, Ventas beneficially 
 owned approximately 6.5 of our outstanding common stock. 
 The Ventas Master Lease includes a number of significant operating and financial restrictions, including requirements that we 
 maintain a minimum portfolio coverage ratio of 2.2x and a guarantor fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.2x and do not exceed a 
 guarantor net leverage ratio of 6.75x. In addition, the Relative Rights Agreement entered into by and among Ventas, the 
 5.75 Senior Notes trustee and the administrative agents under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) in 
 connection with the series of debt transactions completed during the year ended 2021 to refinance our then-existing debt, 
 among other things, (i) sets forth the relative rights of Ventas and the administrative agents with respect to the properties and 
 collateral related to the Ventas Master Lease and securing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, (ii) caps the amount of 
 indebtedness incurred or guaranteed by our subsidiaries that are tenants under the Ventas Master Lease ("Tenants") (together 
 with such Tenants guarantees of the notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and all other indebtedness incurred or 
 guaranteed by such Tenants) at 375.0 million and (iii) imposes certain incurrence tests on the incurrence of additional 
 indebtedness by such Tenants and by us. 
 We recorded rent expense of 37.2 million and 36.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , 
 respectively, and 111.4 million and 108.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, 
 related to the Ventas Master Lease and other lease agreements with Ventas for certain medical office buildings. 
 
 Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 Effective July 8, 2021, we entered into the ABL Credit Agreement, which was amended most recently on June 26, 2024. The 
 ABL Credit Agreement (as so amended) consists of a 325.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with 
 a five year maturity, comprised of (i) a 275.0 million non-UT Health East Texas borrowers tranche (the non-UT Health 
 East Texas ABL Facility and (ii) a 50.0 million UT Health East Texas borrowers tranche available to our AHS East Texas 
 Health System, LLC subsidiary and certain of its subsidiaries (the UT Health East Texas ABL Facility and, together with 
 the non-UT Health East Texas ABL Facility, the ABL Facilities ), each subject to a borrowing base. Effective as of June 26,

Table of Contents 

2024, we amended the ABL Credit Agreement to increase the commitments available under the non-UT Health East Texas 
 ABL Facility from 175.0 million to 275.0 million and to extend the maturity of the ABL Facilities to June 26, 2029. 
 Effective August 24, 2021, we entered into the Term Loan B Facility. The credit agreement governing the Term Loan B 
 Facility provided funding up to a principal amount of 900.0 million. The Term Loan B Facility has a seven year maturity 
 with principal due in quarterly installments of 0.25 of the initial 900.0 million principal amount (subject to certain 
 reductions from time to time as a result of the application of prepayments), with the remaining balance due upon maturity of 
 the Term Loan B Facility. Effective June 8, 2023, we amended the Term Loan B Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR with 
 Term SOFR (each as defined in the amended Term Loan B Credit Agreement) as the reference interest rate and establish 
 further successor rates. On June 26, 2024, we prepaid 100.0 million of the 877.5 million outstanding borrowings under the 
 Term Loan B Facility using cash on hand. Additionally, on September 18, 2024, we executed an amendment to reprice our 
 Term Loan B Credit Agreement. The repricing reduced the applicable interest rate by 50 basis points from Term SOFR plus 
 3.25 to Term SOFR plus 2.75 and eliminated the credit spread adjustment. No modifications were made to the maturity 
 of the loans as a result of the repricing and all other terms were substantially unchanged. 
 We refer to the ABL Facilities and the Term Loan B Facility collectively herein as the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, the ABL Facilities are secured by first priority liens over substantially all of our and each 
 guarantor s accounts and other receivables, chattel paper, deposit accounts and securities accounts, general intangibles, 
 instruments, investment property, commercial tort claims and letters of credit relating to the foregoing, along with books, 
 records and documents, and proceeds thereof (the ABL Priority Collateral ), and a second priority lien over substantially all 
 of our and each guarantor s other assets (including all of the capital stock of the domestic guarantors and first priority 
 mortgage liens on any fee-owned real property valued in excess of 5,000,000) (the Term Priority Collateral ). The 
 obligations of the UT Health East Texas ABL Facility are not secured by the assets of the subsidiaries that are also Tenants 
 and certain other subsidiaries related to the Tenants. The obligations under the Term Loan B Facility and the ABL Facilities 
 in excess of the maximum aggregate dollar cap amount permitted to be guaranteed by the Tenants are not secured by the 
 assets of the Tenants. 
 The Term Loan B Facility is secured by a first priority lien on the Term Priority Collateral and a second priority lien on the 
 ABL Priority Collateral. Certain excluded assets are not included in the Term Priority Collateral or the ABL Priority 
 Collateral. The obligations under the Term Loan B Facility and the ABL Facilities in excess of the maximum aggregate dollar 
 cap amount permitted to be guaranteed by the Tenants are not secured by the assets of the Tenants. 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (i) the base rate 
 determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50 , (b) the Prime Rate in the United 
 States for U.S. dollar loans as publicly announced by Bank of America from time to time, and (c) Term SOFR plus 1.00 per 
 annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin, or (ii) Term SOFR (not to be less than 0.50 per annum) for the interest 
 period selected, plus an applicable margin. Under the Term Loan B Facility, the applicable margin is 2.50 for base rate 
 borrowings and 3.50 for Term SOFR borrowings. Following the completion of the IPO, the applicable margin for the 
 remaining outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility was automatically reduced by 0.25 per annum. 
 Principal under the Term Loan B Facility is due in quarterly installments of 0.25 of the 900.0 million initial principal 
 amount (subject to certain reductions from time to time as a result of the application of prepayments), with the remaining 
 balance due upon maturity. The ABL Facilities do not require installment payments. 
 At the election of the borrowers under the applicable ABL Facility loan, the interest rate per annum applicable to loans under 
 the ABL Facilities is based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either (i) the base rate plus an 
 applicable margin or (ii) Term SOFR (not to be lower than 0.00 per annum) for the interest period selected, plus an 
 applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined based on the percentage of the average daily availability of the 
 applicable ABL Facility. For the non-UT Health East Texas ABL Facility loan, the applicable margin ranges from 0.5 to 
 1.0 for base rate borrowings and 1.5 to 2.0 for Term SOFR borrowings. The applicable margin for the UT Health East 
 Texas ABL Facility loan ranges from 1.5 to 2.0 for base rate borrowings and 2.5 to 3.0 for Term SOFR borrowings. 
 Subject to certain exceptions (including with regard to the ABL Priority Collateral), thresholds and reinvestment rights, the 
 Term Loan B Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments with respect to:

 5.750 Senior Notes due 2029 
 AHP Health Partners, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, issued the 5.75 Senior Notes in an exempt offering pursuant to 
 Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act that was completed on July 8, 2021. The terms of the 5.75 Senior 
 Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of July 8, 2021 (the Indenture ), among AHP Health Partners, us and certain of 
 AHP Health Partners' wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National 
 Association, as trustee. The Indenture provides that the 5.75 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of AHP 
 Health Partners, which are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us and certain subsidiaries of AHP 
 Health Partners. 
 The 5.75 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 5.750 per annum, payable semi-annually, in 
 cash in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2022. 
 AHP Health Partners may redeem the 5.75 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, (1) prior to 
 July 15, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 5.75 Senior Notes, plus accrued and 
 unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the Indenture and the 5.75 
 Senior Notes; and (2) on and after July 15, 2024, at the redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if 
 any, to the redemption date, subject to compliance with certain conditions:

 original aggregate principal amount of the 5.75 Senior Notes with the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings, as 
 described in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to 105.750 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid 
 interest, if any, to the redemption date, provided that at least 50 of the aggregate original principal amount of the 5.75 
 Senior Notes issued under the Indenture remained outstanding after each such redemption and the redemption occurred

Outstanding letters of credit are required principally by certain insurers and states to collateralize our workers' compensation 
 programs and self-insured retentions associated with our professional and general liability insurance programs. As of 
 September 30, 2024 , we maintained outstanding letters of credit of approximately 40.1 million , which included interest of 
 3.2 million . 
 
 Supplemental Non-GAAP Valuation Measure 
 Adjusted EBITDAR is a commonly used non-GAAP valuation measure used by our management, research analysts, 
 investors and other interested parties to evaluate and compare the enterprise value of different companies in our industry. 
 Adjusted EBITDAR excludes: (1) certain material noncash items and unusual or non-recurring items that we do not expect to 
 continue in the future; (2) certain other adjustments that do not impact our enterprise value; and (3) rent expense payable to 
 our REITs. We operate 30 acute care hospitals, 12 of which we lease from two REITs, Ventas and MPT, pursuant to long- 
 term lease agreements. Additionally, during 2022, we completed the sale of 18 medical office buildings to Ventas in 
 exchange for 204.0 million and concurrently entered into agreements to lease the real estate back from Ventas over a 12- 
 year initial term with eight options to renew for additional five-year terms (the "MOB Transactions"). Our management views 
 the long-term lease agreements with Ventas and MPT, as well as the MOB Transactions, as more like financing arrangements 
 than true operating leases, with the rent payable to such REITs being similar to interest expense. As a result, our capital 
 structure is different than many of our competitors, especially those whose real estate portfolio is predominately owned and 
 not leased. Excluding the rent payable to such REITs allows investors to compare our enterprise value to those of other 
 healthcare companies without regard to differences in capital structures, leasing arrangements and geographic markets, which 
 can vary significantly among companies. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDAR as one measure in determining the 
 value of prospective acquisitions or divestitures. Finally, financial covenants in certain of our lease agreements, including the 
 Ventas Master Lease, use Adjusted EBITDAR as a measure of compliance. Adjusted EBITDAR does not reflect our cash 
 requirements for leasing commitments. As such, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as a 
 performance or liquidity measure. 
 Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to 
 other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 While we believe this is a useful supplemental valuation measure for investors and other users of our financial information, 
 you should not consider the non-GAAP measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other items calculated in 
 accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAR has inherent material limitations as a valuation measure, because it adds back 
 certain expenses to net income, resulting in those expenses not being taken into account in the valuation measure. The 
 payment of taxes and rent is a necessary element of our valuation. Because Adjusted EBITDAR excludes these and other 
 items, it has material limitations as a measure of our valuation.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
 reported amounts and related disclosures. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use. In general, we 
 base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, given the particular 
 circumstances in which we operate. Actual results may vary from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting 
 estimates to be those that (i) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (ii) require estimates that are more difficult for 
 management to determine, and (iii) may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using 
 different assumptions. 
 Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting 
 Policies and Estimates and our audited consolidated financial statements a nd notes thereto as of and for the year ended 
 December 31, 2023 included in our Final Prospectus for a complete and comprehensive discussion of the accounting policies 
 and related estimates we believe are most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements, financial condition 
 and results of operations and that require complex management judgment and assumptions or involve uncertainties. These 
 critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition, risk management and self-insured liabilities, income taxes, and

unit-based compensation. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies or their application since the date of 
 our Final Prospectus.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash 
 management activities. We do not, however, hold or issue financial instruments or derivatives for trading or speculative 
 purposes. At September 30, 2024 , the following components of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities bore interest at variable 
 rates at specified margins above either the agent bank s alternate base rate or Term SOFR: (i) a 900.0 million, seven-year 
 term loan; and (ii) a 325.0 million, five-year asset-based revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 
 outstanding variable rate debt of 774.0 million . 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 521.1 million , expiring June 
 30, 2026. Under these swap agreements, we are required to make monthly fixed rate payments at annual rates ranging from 
 1.47 to 1.48 and the counterparties are obligated to make monthly floating rate payments to us based on one-month Term 
 SOFR, each subject to a floor of 0.39 . 
 Although changes in the alternate base rate or Term SOFR would affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future, we believe 
 the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt on our consolidated 
 financial position, results of operations or cash flows would not be material. Based on the outstanding borrowings and impact 
 of the interest rate swaps in place at September 30, 2024 , a one percent change in the interest rate would result in a 2.5 
 million increase or decrease in our annual interest expense. 
 We currently believe we have adequate liquidity to fund operations during the near term through the generation of operating 
 cash flows, cash on hand and access to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our ability to borrow funds under our ABL 
 Facilities is subject to, among other things, the financial viability of the participating financial institutions. While we do not 
 anticipate any of our current lenders defaulting on their obligations, we are unable to provide assurance that any particular 
 lender will not default at a future date. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of 
 the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on 
 this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 , our principal executive officer and 
 principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date were effective at the 
 reasonable assurance level. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under 
 the S ecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company 
 that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under 
 the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and 
 forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide 
 only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the 
 cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as 
 such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, 
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (a) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 On July 17, 2024, in connection with the IPO, ALH Holdings, LLC (a subsidiary of Ventas, Inc.) contributed all of its 
 outstanding common stock in AHP Health Partners (our direct subsidiary) to Ardent Health Partners, Inc. in exchange for 
 5,178,202 shares of common stock of Ardent Health Partners, Inc. (the ALH Contribution ). The issuance of securities in 
 the ALH Contribution was deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to 
 Section 4(a)(2) thereof, as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. 
 (b) Use of Proceeds from Initial Public Offering of Common Stock 
 On July 17, 2024, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-280425) related to the IPO was declared effective by 
 the SEC. Pursuant to such registration statement, we issued and sold 12,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering 
 price of 16.00 per share on July 19, 2024. We received net proceeds of approximately 181.4 million , after deducting 
 underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 10.6 million . On July 30, 2024, in conjunction with the 
 underwriters exercising their option to purchase additional shares, we issued an additional 1,800,000 shares of common stock 
 at the initial public offering price of 16.00 per share for additional net proceeds of approximately 27.2 million , after 
 deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 1.6 million . None of the expenses associated with the 
 IPO were paid to directors, officers, or persons owning 10 or more of any class of equity securities, or to our affiliates. 
 There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from the IPO from those described in the Final Prospectus, 
 dated July 17, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 18, 2024, pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act. J.P. Morgan 
 Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the IPO. For 
 additional details on the IPO, refer to Note 1 Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation Initial Public Offering

 rate. The determination of Term SOFR by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of 
 manifest error.

 and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the 
 Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender 
 made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through 
 the Administrative Agent) a promissory note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to

 Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative 
 Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 12 00 p.m. on the date 
 specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or 
 other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to 
 such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12 00 p.m. shall 

64 

in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee 
 shall continue to accrue. 
 (b) Subject to the definition of Interest Period, if any payment to be made by the Borrower 
 shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following 
 Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may 
 be. 
 (c) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent 
 to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) 
 first , toward costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III 
 incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, (ii) second , toward repayment of interest and fees 
 then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest 
 and fees then due to such parties, and (iii) third , toward repayment of principal then due hereunder, 
 ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such 
 parties. 
 (d) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the 
 time any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower 
 or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume 
 that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall 
 not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled 
 thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in 
 immediately available funds, then 
 (i) with respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account 
 of the Lenders hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination 
 shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment 
 referred to as the Rescindable Amount (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment 
 (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the 
 Borrower (whether or not then owed) or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason 
 otherwise erroneously made such payment then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to 
 the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such 
 Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the 
 date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative 
 Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative 
 Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and 
 (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on 
 demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, 
 together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the 
 Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative 
 Agent (the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from 
 time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such 
 amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender 
 does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent s demand therefor, the 
 Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall 
 pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the 
 Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable 
 Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its 

65 

Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may 
 have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount 
 owing under this Section 2.12(d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (e) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made 
 by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made 
 available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable 
 Borrowing set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the 
 Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, 
 without interest. 
 (f) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans are several and not joint. 
 The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its 
 corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any 
 other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (g) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan 
 in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or 
 will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (h) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the 
 Loan Documents, if at any time following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of 
 Default, but prior to the exercise of remedies as provided for in Section 9.02 , payment is made by the 
 Borrower and is applied to payment of principal or interest on the Loans, such payment shall be applied 
 ratably to the unpaid principal or interest, as the case may be, of the Loans (and breakage, termination or 
 other payments and any interest accrued thereon). 
 2.13 Sharing of Payments 
 If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the 
 Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of 
 setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such 
 Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the 
 other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them, as shall be necessary to cause such 
 purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans, pro rata with each of them 
 provided , however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the 
 purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any 
 settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be 
 rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, 
 together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) 
 the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the 
 purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of 
 the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so 
 purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, 
 exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 11.09 with respect 
 to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of 
 such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in 
 the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case 

66 

notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a 
 participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all 
 notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the 
 portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original 
 owner of the Obligations purchased.

 (f) shall have occurred and be continuing, (x) at the time that any such Incremental Term Loan is made, 
 the representations and warranties of the Borrower and each other Loan Party contained in Article VI or

 they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date provided that to the extent 
 that any representation and warranty is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect , such 
 representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects on such respective dates, and except

 amount, so long as in the case of this clause (y) only, the Borrower has at the time such Incremental Term 
 Loan is made, a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio equal to or less than 3.75 1.00 calculated on a Pro 
 Forma Basis provided that for purposes of this clause (y), net cash proceeds of Incremental Term Loans 
 incurred at such time shall not be netted against the applicable amount of Consolidated Indebtedness for 
 purposes of such calculation of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio plus (z) the aggregate amount of 
 voluntary prepayments of Term Loans other than from the proceeds of the incurrence of Indebtedness 
 provided , however , that if amounts incurred under clause (y) are incurred concurrently with the 
 incurrence of Incremental Term Loans under clause (x) and or (z), the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio 
 shall be calculated without giving effect to such amounts incurred in reliance on the foregoing clause (x) 
 and or (z) provided , further , for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the proceeds of any Incremental

 The Borrower may elect to use clause (y) of the Available Incremental Amount regardless of whether the 
 Borrower has capacity under clauses (x) or (z) of the Available Incremental Amount. Further, the

 (including an Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement if applicable) reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower 
 and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans provided that, to the extent such terms and 
 documentation are not consistent with this Agreement (except as they relate to maturity, Weighted 
 Average Life to Maturity or interest rates), they shall not be more favorable, taken as a whole (as 
 reasonably determined by the Borrower), to the lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans than the 
 terms of the Term Loans (other than with respect to terms and conditions applicable after the maturity of 
 the Term Loans) unless such more favorable terms are added for the benefit of the Term Loans, which

 reference to Term SOFR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and 
 actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day

 and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the 
 Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender 
 made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through 
 the Administrative Agent) a promissory note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to

 Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative 
 Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 12 00 p.m. on the date 
 specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or 
 other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to 
 such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12 00 p.m. shall 

73 

in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee 
 shall continue to accrue. 
 (b) Subject to the definition of Interest Period, if any payment to be made by the Borrower 
 shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following 
 Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may 
 be. 
 (c) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent 
 to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) 
 first , toward costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III 
 incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, (ii) second , toward repayment of interest and fees 
 then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest 
 and fees then due to such parties, and (iii) third , toward repayment of principal then due hereunder, 
 ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such 
 parties. 
 (d) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the 
 time any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower 
 or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume 
 that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall 
 not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled 
 thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in 
 immediately available funds, then 
 (i) with respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account 
 of the Lenders hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination 
 shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment 
 referred to as the Rescindable Amount (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment 
 (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the 
 Borrower (whether or not then owed) or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason 
 otherwise erroneously made such payment then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to 
 the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such 
 Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the 
 date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative 
 Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative 
 Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and 
 (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on 
 demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, 
 together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the 
 Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative 
 Agent (the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from 
 time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such 
 amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender 
 does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent s demand therefor, the 
 Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall 
 pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the 
 Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable 
 Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its 

74 

Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may 
 have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount 
 owing under this Section 2.12(d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (e) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made 
 by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made 
 available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable 
 Borrowing set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the 
 Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, 
 without interest. 
 (f) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans are several and not joint. 
 The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its 
 corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any 
 other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (g) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan 
 in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or 
 will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (h) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the 
 Loan Documents, if at any time following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of 
 Default, but prior to the exercise of remedies as provided for in Section 9.02 , payment is made by the 
 Borrower and is applied to payment of principal or interest on the Loans, such payment shall be applied 
 ratably to the unpaid principal or interest, as the case may be, of the Loans (and breakage, termination or 
 other payments and any interest accrued thereon). 
 2.13 Sharing of Payments 
 If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the 
 Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of 
 setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such 
 Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the 
 other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them, as shall be necessary to cause such 
 purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans, pro rata with each of them 
 provided , however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the 
 purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any 
 settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be 
 rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, 
 together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) 
 the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the 
 purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of 
 the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so 
 purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, 
 exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 11.09 with respect 
 to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of 
 such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in 
 the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case 

75 

notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a 
 participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all 
 notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the 
 portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original 
 owner of the Obligations purchased. 
 2.14 Incremental Borrowings 
 (a) The Borrower may at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date, by notice to 
 the Administrative Agent (whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to the 
 Lenders), request one or more additional tranches of term loans or increases to an existing tranche of term 
 loans (the Incremental Term Loans provided that (w) at the time that any such Incremental Term Loan 
 is made, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, except that in the case of 
 Incremental Term Loans incurred to make a Permitted Acquisition or a Permitted Investment, in which 
 case at the time such Incremental Term Loan is made, no Event of Default pursuant to Sections 9.01(a) or 
 (f) shall have occurred and be continuing, (x) at the time that any such Incremental Term Loan is made, 
 the representations and warranties of the Borrower and each other Loan Party contained in Article VI or 
 any other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such dates, except 
 to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case 
 they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date provided that to the extent 
 that any representation and warranty is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect , such 
 representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects on such respective dates, and except 
 that for purposes of this section, the representations and warranties contained in clause (a) of Section 6.05 
 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), 
 respectively, of Section 7.01 provided , further , that, in the case of Incremental Term Loans incurred to 
 make a Permitted Acquisition or a Permitted Investment, such representations and warranties to be made 
 at the time that any such Incremental Term Loan is made shall be limited to the Specified Representations 
 and the acquisition agreement representations (or similar representations) conformed as appropriate for 
 such transaction and (y) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a 
 Responsible Officer, in detail reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, demonstrating that the 
 incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans requested does not violate the provisions of the Relative 
 Rights Agreement or the Master Lease. The aggregate amount of the Incremental Term Loans shall not 
 exceed the greater of (x)(A) 500,000,000 and (B) 100 of Consolidated EBITDA plus (y) an unlimited 
 amount, so long as in the case of this clause (y) only, the Borrower has at the time such Incremental Term 
 Loan is made, a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio equal to or less than 3.75 1.00 calculated on a Pro 
 Forma Basis provided that for purposes of this clause (y), net cash proceeds of Incremental Term Loans 
 incurred at such time shall not be netted against the applicable amount of Consolidated Indebtedness for 
 purposes of such calculation of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio plus (z) the aggregate amount of 
 voluntary prepayments of Term Loans other than from the proceeds of the incurrence of Indebtedness 
 provided , however , that if amounts incurred under clause (y) are incurred concurrently with the 
 incurrence of Incremental Term Loans under clause (x) and or (z), the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio 
 shall be calculated without giving effect to such amounts incurred in reliance on the foregoing clause (x) 
 and or (z) provided , further , for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the proceeds of any Incremental 
 Term Loans are being utilized to repay Indebtedness, such calculations shall give pro forma effect to such 
 repayments) (the amount available under clauses (x), (y) and (z), the Available Incremental Amount ). 
 The Borrower may elect to use clause (y) of the Available Incremental Amount regardless of whether the 
 Borrower has capacity under clauses (x) or (z) of the Available Incremental Amount. Further, the 
 Borrower may elect to use clause (y) of the Available Incremental Amount prior to using clause (x) or (z) 
 of the Available Incremental Amount, and if both clause (y) and clause (x) and or (z) of the Available 

76 

Incremental Amount are available and the Borrower does not make an election, then the Borrower 
 will be deemed to have elected to use clause (y) of the Available Incremental Amount. 
 (b) The Incremental Term Loans shall (i) be on terms and pursuant to documentation to be 
 determined by the Borrower and the Lenders thereunder provided that, to the extent such terms and 
 documentation (except to the extent permitted by clauses (ii) and (iii) below) are not consistent with this 
 Agreement, they shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (ii) (A) 
 not mature earlier than the Maturity Date for any outstanding Term Loans and (B) have a Weighted 
 Average Life to Maturity no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any 
 outstanding Term Loans provided that this clause (ii) shall not apply to up to 150,000,000 of

 Limitations ), (iii) only be guaranteed by the Guarantors, (iv) have interest rates and an amortization 
 schedule (subject to clause (ii) above) applicable to the Incremental Term Loans determined by the

 Term Loans incurred within twelve (12) months of the Effective Date exceeds the Applicable Rate 
 relating to any outstanding Term Loans immediately prior to the effectiveness of the applicable 
 Incremental Amendment by more than 0.50 per annum, the Applicable Rate relating to such Term 
 Loans shall be adjusted to be equal to the Applicable Rate relating to such Incremental Term Loans minus 
 0.50 per annum provided , further , that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply if (x) such 
 Incremental Term Loans mature more than 12 months after the Maturity Date or (y) the aggregate 
 principal amount of such Incremental Term Loans (together with the aggregate principal amount of all 
 other Incremental Term Loans excluded in reliance on this clause (y) and term loan Indebtedness secured 
 on a pari passu basis with the Liens securing the Term Loans pursuant to Section 8.03(u) and (v) does 
 not exceed 150,000,000 in the aggregate (the provisions under this proviso and the immediately 
 preceding proviso collectively, the MFN Provisions provided , further , that in determining the 
 Applicable Rate for Incremental Term Loans or Term Loans solely for purposes of the two immediately 
 preceding provisos, (w) original issue discount OID or upfront fees (which shall be deemed to 
 constitute like amounts of OID) paid by the Borrower to all Lenders (and not any one Lender) providing 
 Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans in the initial primary syndication thereof shall be included and 
 equated to interest (with OID being equated to interest based on an assumed four-year life to maturity), 
 (x) customary arrangement or commitment fees payable to the Joint Book Runners in connection with the 
 Term Loans or to one or more arrangers (or their Affiliates) of the Incremental Term Loans shall be 
 excluded, (y) if the lowest permissible Base Rate is greater than 1.50 per annum and the lowest 
 permissible Term SOFR is greater than 0.50 per annum, in each case the difference between the floor 
 and 0.50 , in the case of Term SOFR Loans, and such floor and 1.50 per annum, in the case of Base 
 Rate Loans, shall be equated to Applicable Rate for purposes of the two immediately preceding provisos 
 and (v) the Incremental Term Loans may be secured only by Collateral and may only be secured by either 
 a pari passu or a junior Lien on the Collateral, in each case on terms and pursuant to documentation 
 (including an Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement if applicable) reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower 
 and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans provided that, to the extent such terms and 
 documentation are not consistent with this Agreement (except as they relate to maturity, Weighted 
 Average Life to Maturity or interest rates), they shall not be more favorable, taken as a whole (as 
 reasonably determined by the Borrower), to the lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans than the 
 terms of the Term Loans (other than with respect to terms and conditions applicable after the maturity of 
 the Term Loans) unless such more favorable terms are added for the benefit of the Term Loans, which 
 shall not require the consent of the Lenders and any such Incremental Term Loans may contain any 
 financial maintenance covenants, so long as such covenants are also added for the benefit of the Lenders, 
 which shall not require consent of the Lenders. 

77 

(a) Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall set forth the requested 
 amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Term Loans. Incremental Term Loans may be 
 made by an existing Lender (and no Term Loan Lender shall have any obligation to make an Incremental 
 Term Loan) or by any other bank or other financial institution reasonably acceptable to the 
 Administrative Agent and the Borrower (any such other bank or other financial institution being called an 
 Additional Lender ).

 Agent. The Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such 
 amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the 
 reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 
 2.14 (including, without limitation, to preserve fungibility or to add premiums in respect of existing 
 Term Loans in connection with an increase to such Term Loans). 
 (c) This Section 2.14 shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.13 and 11.01 to the 
 contrary. 
 2.15 Defaulting Lenders

 that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this 
 Agreement fifth , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts 
 owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained 
 by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of 
 its obligations under this Agreement and sixth , to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed 

78

 principal amount of any Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its 
 appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions to such Borrowing 
 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non- 
 Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that 
 Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting 
 Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash

 cease to be a Defaulting Lender provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to 
 fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting 
 Lender and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties 
 and subject to Section 11.22, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a 
 waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting 
 Lender.

 extent such covenants and other terms apply to any period after the latest maturity date applicable 
 to any Class of Term Loans unless such more favorable terms are added for the benefit of the 
 Term Loans, which shall not require the consent of the Lenders and (ii) a financial maintenance 
 covenant may be added for the benefit of such Refinancing Term Loans, so long as such financial

 purposes of this Agreement provided, further, that any Refinancing Term Loans may, to the extent 
 provided in the applicable Refinancing Amendment governing such Refinancing Term Loans, be 
 designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Term Loans made to the Borrower and in 
 connection with any such increase, the Borrower may amend, without the consent of any Lender, the 
 terms of such previously established Class of Term Loans to include premiums and or to increase the 
 pricing thereof.

 applicable to any Incremental Term Loans, as applicable, then in effect (such existing Maturity Date 
 being the Existing Term Loan Maturity Date and such existing maturity date applicable to any 
 Incremental Term Loans being the Existing Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date to a date specified 
 in such notice. Within 10 Business Days of delivery of such notice (or such other period as the Borrower 
 and the Administrative Agent shall mutually agree upon), each Term Loan Lender or Additional Lender, 
 as applicable, shall notify the Administrative Agent whether it consents to such extension (which consent 
 may be given or withheld in such Term Loan Lender s or Additional Lender s, as applicable, sole and 
 absolute discretion). Any Term Loan Lender or Additional Lender, as applicable, not responding within 
 the above time period shall be deemed not to have consented to such extension. The Administrative

 Term Loan Lenders or the Additional Lenders responses, as applicable. 
 (b) The Maturity Date or Existing Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable, shall

 the Term Loan Lenders or Additional Lenders, as applicable, that declined being the Non-Extending 
 Term Lenders (it being understood and agreed that, except for the consents of the Extending Term

 maturity date applicable to such Incremental Term Loans (such date, the Extended Incremental Term 
 Loan Maturity Date ). The Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall promptly confirm to (y) the 
 Term Loan Lenders such extension, specifying the effective date of such extension (the Term Loan 
 Extension Effective Date ), the then scheduled Maturity Date and the Extended Term Loan Maturity Date 
 (after giving effect to such extension) and (z) the applicable Additional Lenders such extension, 
 specifying the effective date of such extension (the Incremental Term Loan Extension Effective Date ), 
 the then scheduled maturity date applicable to such Incremental Term Loans and the Extended 
 Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date (after giving effect to such extension). The interest margins and or 
 floors with respect to any Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans, as applicable, extended pursuant to 
 this Section 2.17 may be different than the interest margins and or floors for the existing Term Loans or 
 Incremental Term Loans, as applicable, and upfront fees may be paid to the Extending Term Lenders, in 
 each case to the extent provided in the Borrower s notice. Except as to interest rates, fees, premiums, 
 prepayments and final maturity (which shall be subject to this Section 2.17), the terms of the Term Loans 

81 

held by the Extending Term Lenders shall be substantially identical to the terms of the Term Loans held

 deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower dated as of the Term Loan Extension 
 Effective Date or the Incremental Term Loan Extension Effective Date, as applicable, signed by a 
 Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower 
 approving or consenting to such extension and certifying that, before and after giving effect to such 
 extension, the representations and warranties contained in Article VI made by it are true and correct in all 
 material respects on and as of the Term Loan Extension Effective Date or the Incremental Term Loan 
 Extension Effective Date, as applicable, except to the extent that such representations and warranties 
 specifically refer to an earlier date, and no Default or Event of Default exists or will exist as of the Term 
 Loan Extension Effective Date or the Incremental Term Loan Extension Effective Date, as applicable. 
 The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Non-Extending Term Lender 
 the then unpaid principal amount of such Non-Extending Term Lender s Term Loans or Incremental 
 Term Loans, as applicable, outstanding on the Existing Term Loan Maturity Date or the Existing 
 Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant 
 to Section 2.16 ). Notwithstanding the terms of Section 11.01 , the Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
 shall be entitled (without the consent of any other Lenders) to enter into any amendments to this 
 Agreement that the Administrative Agent believes are necessary to appropriately reflect, or provide for 
 the integration of, any extension of a Maturity Date or maturity date applicable to any Incremental Term 
 Loans, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 2.17 . 
 (c) The Borrower may replace any Non-Extending Term Lender in accordance with Section 
 11.16 .

 on an unsecured, silent second, passive and fully subordinated (on terms to be mutually agreed among the 
 Ventas Assignee, the Tenant Subsidiaries, the other Loan Parties, the Required Lenders (excluding the 
 Ventas Assignee or any Lender of the Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans) and the Administrative 
 Agent) basis (other than with respect to the pledge of the Capital Stock of the Tenant Subsidiaries) to all 
 Obligations hereunder, the obligations under the ABL Facility and the 2029 Notes Indenture and certain 
 other Indebtedness of the Loan Parties subject to the Relative Rights Agreement and (y) guaranteed by

 Tenant Subsidiaries that constitute Collateral for the Term Loans immediately prior to the Ventas 
 Purchase Option Assignment and (y) the Capital Stock of the Tenant Subsidiaries (ii) the Non-Ventas 
 Purchase Option Term Loans shall not be guaranteed by the Tenant Subsidiaries or be secured by Liens

 Ventas Assignee, (iv) the Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans and the Non-Ventas Purchase Option 
 Term Loans shall be outstanding under this Agreement as separate Classes of Term Loans, (v) neither the 
 Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans nor the Non-Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans shall have a

 Average Life to Maturity than the then outstanding Term Loans, (vi) the Tenant Subsidiaries shall 
 become Unrestricted Subsidiaries with respect to the Non-Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans (without 
 being required to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiaries

 the date of the consummation of the Ventas Purchase Option Assignment by a Ventas Purchase Option 
 Amendment which documents the terms and conditions of the Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans

 Borrower (and to the extent affecting the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent) and shall 
 include, without limitation, the following provisions (1) that the Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans will 
 deem Parent and each of its Subsidiaries, other than the Tenant Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, 
 (2) limitations on the incurrence of Liens on and pledges in respect of the Capital Stock of Tenant 
 Subsidiaries, (3) separate voting and consent rights with respect to the Non-Ventas Purchase Option Term

 restatement, supplement or other modification to this Agreement (the Ventas Purchase Option 
 Amendment and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent or the Ventas Purchase Option 
 Term Loan Agent shall reasonably request (including as set forth in clause (b) above). Any Ventas 
 Purchase Option Amendment shall not require the consent of any Lender and may effect such 
 amendments to the Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable judgment of 
 the Administrative Agent, the Ventas Purchase Option Term Loan Agent, the Borrower and the Ventas 
 Assignee, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.18 provided that except as set forth in this Section 
 2.18 , the terms applicable to the Non-Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans immediately after giving effect 
 to such Ventas Purchase Option Amendment shall not be any less favorable to Term Loan Lenders 
 holding Non-Ventas Purchase Option Term Loans than the terms applicable to such Term Loans 
 immediately prior to giving effect to such Ventas Purchase Option Amendment. The Ventas Purchase 
 Option Amendment shall be binding on the Lenders, Ventas, the Loan Parties and the other parties hereto. 
 ARTICLE III 
 TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
 3.01 Taxes 
 (a) Unless required by Law (as determined in good faith by the applicable withholding agent), 
 any and all payments by any Loan Party to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
 under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any 
 and all present or future Taxes. If the applicable withholding agent shall be required by any Laws to 
 deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative 
 Agent or any Lender, (i) if the Tax in question is an Indemnified Tax or an Other Tax, the sum payable by 
 the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions (including 
 deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01 have been made, each Lender 
 (or in the case of a payment made to the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative 
 Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, 
 (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions, (iii) the applicable withholding agent 
 shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in 
 accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty days after the date of such payment, the 
 applicable Loan Party (if the Loan Party is the applicable withholding agent) shall furnish to the 
 Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a 
 receipt evidencing payment thereof, or if no receipt is available, other evidence of payment reasonably 
 satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or 
 documentary Taxes and any other excise, property or similar Taxes which arise from any payment made 
 under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, 
 or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes ). 
 (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for (i) the 
 full amount of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes 

84 

imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.01 paid or payable by 
 the Administrative Agent and such Lender and (ii) any liability (including additions to Tax, penalties, 
 interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such 
 Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant 
 Governmental Authority. Payment under this Section 3.01(c) shall be made within thirty days after the 
 date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor. 
 (d) If any Lender determines, in its good faith discretion, that it has received a refund of any 
 Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to 
 which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall pay (subject to 
 the Lender s right of set-off) over such refund to the Borrower or such Loan Party (but only to the extent 
 of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Person under this Section 3.01 with 
 respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable and 
 documented out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Lender and without interest (other than any 
 interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund net of any Taxes 
 payable by such Lender) provided that the Borrower or any Loan Party, upon the request of the Lender, 
 agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Person (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed 
 by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender in the event the Lender is required to repay such 
 refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 3.01(d) shall not be construed to require the Lender 
 to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems 
 confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 (e) Each Lender shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with any documentation 
 prescribed by Law, or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, certifying as to 
 any entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from, or reduction in, any withholding Tax with respect 
 to any payments to be made to such Lender under the Loan Documents. Each such Lender shall, 
 whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such documentation (including any specific 
 documentation required below in this Section 3.01(e) expired, obsolete or inaccurate in any material 
 respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate 
 documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the applicable withholding 
 agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its legal ineligibility to do so. 
 Unless the applicable withholding agent has received forms or other documents satisfactory to it 
 indicating that payments under any Loan Document to or for a Lender are not subject to withholding tax 
 or are subject to such Tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Borrower, Administrative 
 Agent or other applicable withholding agent may withhold amounts required to be withheld by applicable 
 Law from such payments at the applicable statutory rate. Each Lender hereby authorizes the 
 Administrative Agent to deliver to the Borrower and to any successor Administrative Agent any 
 documentation provided to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.01(e) . 
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing 
 (i) Each Lender that is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of 
 the Internal Revenue Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or 
 before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly 
 signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying 
 that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding. 
 (ii) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) 
 of the Internal Revenue Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or 

85 

before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter 
 when required by Law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative 
 Agent) whichever of the following is applicable 
 (I) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN 
 or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax 
 treaty to which the United States of America is a party 
 (II) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI 
 (or any successor forms) 
 (III) in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio 
 interest under Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate, in 
 substantially the form of Exhibit O (any such certificate a United States Tax Compliance 
 Certificate ), or any other form approved by the Administrative Agent, to the effect that 
 such Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the 
 Internal Revenue Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of a Borrower within the meaning 
 of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (C) a controlled foreign 
 corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that no 
 payments in connection with the Loan Documents are effectively connected with such 
 Lender s conduct of a U.S. trade or business and (y) two duly completed copies of 
 Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms) 
 (IV) to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the 
 Lender is a partnership, or is a Participant holding a participation granted by a 
 participating Lender), Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) 
 of the Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, United States 
 Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY (or other successor forms) or any 
 other required information from each beneficial owner, as applicable provided that, if the 
 Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect 
 partner(s) are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United States Tax 
 Compliance Certificate shall be provided by such Lender on behalf of such direct or 
 indirect partner(s)) or 
 (V) any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of U.S. federal 
 income tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal 
 withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as 
 may be prescribed by applicable requirements of Law to permit the Borrower and the 
 Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.01(e) , a Lender shall not be required to 
 deliver any form that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 (f) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. 
 federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable 
 reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the 
 Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative 
 Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the 
 Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as 
 prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation 

86 

reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower 
 and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such 
 Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA and to determine the amount, if any, 
 to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (f), FATCA shall include 
 any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (g) If the Borrower (or any other Loan Party) is required to pay any amount to any Lender or 
 the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.01 , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts 
 (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to 
 eliminate any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the sole reasonable 
 judgment of such Lender (i) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender and (ii) would not result in 
 any unreimbursed cost or expense to such Lender. 
 (h) For the avoidance of doubt, any payments made by the Administrative Agent to any 
 Lender shall be treated as payments made by the applicable Loan Party. 
 3.02 Illegality 
 If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority 
 has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund 
 Term SOFR Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR, then, on notice 
 thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender 
 to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be 
 suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances 
 giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon 
 demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all 
 Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period 
 therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or 
 immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans. Upon any 
 such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or 
 converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the 
 need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially 
 disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 3.03 Inability To Determine Rates 
 (a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion to or 
 continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent determines that (A) Dollar deposits are not being 
 offered to banks in the relevant interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such 
 Term SOFR Loan, or (B) (x) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining Term SOFR for 
 any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or in connection with an 
 existing or proposed Base Rate Loan and (y) the circumstances described in Section 3.03(c)(i) do not 
 apply (in each case with respect to this clause (i), Impacted Loans ), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or 
 the Required Lenders determine that for any reason Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with 
 respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of 
 funding such Term SOFR Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each 
 Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans shall be 
 suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a 
 determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base 
 Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in 

87 

each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders 
 described in clause (ii) of Section 3.03(a) , until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required 
 Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending 
 request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the 
 affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such 
 request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination 
 described in clause (i) of Section 3.03(a) , the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, 
 may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of 
 interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (i) the Administrative Agent revokes the 
 notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (i) of the first sentence of Section 
 3.03(a) , (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the 
 Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders 
 of funding the Impacted Loans, or (iii) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that 
 any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending 
 Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate 
 of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority 
 has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides 
 the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document 
 (i) Reserved . 
 (ii) Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Benchmark 
 Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any 
 Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5 00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) 
 Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders 
 without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or 
 any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, 
 written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the 
 Required Lenders (and any such objection shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) 
 provided that solely in the event that the then-current Benchmark at the time of such Benchmark 
 Transition Event is Term SOFR, the Benchmark Replacement therefor shall be the sum of (x) 
 Daily Simple SOFR and (y) 0.11448 (11.448 basis points) , unless the Administrative Agent 
 determines that such alternative rate is not available. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily 
 Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 (iii) At any time that the administrator of the then-current Benchmark has 
 permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such Benchmark or such Benchmark has been 
 announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark pursuant to 
 public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative of the underlying 
 market and economic reality that such Benchmark is intended to measure and that 
 representativeness will not be restored, the Borrower may revoke any request for a borrowing of, 
 conversion to or continuation of Loans to be made, converted or continued that would bear 
 interest by reference to such Benchmark until the Borrower s receipt of notice from the 
 Administrative Agent that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced such Benchmark, and, failing 
 that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a 
 borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans. During the period referenced in the foregoing 

88 

sentence, the component of Base Rate based upon the Benchmark will not be used in any 
 determination of Base Rate. 
 (iv) In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark 
 Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement 
 Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in 
 any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement 
 Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other 
 party to this Agreement. 
 (v) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of 
 (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (B) the effectiveness of any 
 Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may 
 be made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.03(c) , including any 
 determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence 
 of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will 
 be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its sole discretion and 
 without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant 
 to this Section 3.03(c) . 
 (vi) At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark 
 Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR), then the 
 Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is unavailable or non- 
 representative for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (B) the 
 Administrative Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Benchmark (including 
 Benchmark Replacement) settings. 
 3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return Capital Adequacy 
 (a) If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the 
 interpretation of any Law, or such Lender s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost 
 to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Term SOFR Loans, or a reduction 
 in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding 
 for purposes of this Section 3.04(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) 
 Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnifiable under Section 3.01 or any Excluded Taxes and (ii) 
 reserve requirements utilized, as to Term SOFR Loans, in the determination of Term SOFR), then from 
 time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the 
 Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such 
 increased cost or reduction provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd- 
 Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives 
 thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives 
 promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or 
 any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case in 
 this clause (y) pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case in this proviso be deemed to be a change in or in 
 the interpretation of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued. 
 (b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or 
 liquidity or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its 
 Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or 
 any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender s obligations hereunder (taking 

89 

into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity and such Lender s desired 
 return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to 
 the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will 
 compensate such Lender for such reduction provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the 
 contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, 
 guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines 
 or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking 
 Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, 
 in each case in this clause (y) pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case in this proviso be deemed to be such 
 a change in or in the interpretation of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued. 
 3.05 Funding Losses 
 Promptly upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to 
 time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any 
 loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of 
 (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a 
 Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether 
 voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise) 
 (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to 
 make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on 
 the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower or 
 (c) an assignment of a Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the 
 Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.16 
 including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or 
 reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan (excluding any loss of anticipated profits) or 
 from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall 
 also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
 For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 
 3.05 , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Term SOFR Loan made by it at Term SOFR used 
 in determining Term SOFR for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable 
 offshore interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such 
 Term SOFR Loan was in fact so funded. 
 3.06 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation 
 (a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this 
 Article III and setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it 
 hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the 
 Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 
 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required under this 
 Article III is given by the Administrative Agent or any Lender more than 90 days after the Administrative 
 Agent or such Lender has knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event 
 giving rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, or other additional amounts described in this 
 Article III , the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall not be entitled to compensation under this 

90 

Article III for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the 91st day prior to the giving of such 
 notice to the Borrower. 
 (b) Upon any Lender s making a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or 3.04 , the 
 Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.16 . 
 3.07 Survival 
 All of the Borrower s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the 
 Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 
 ARTICLE IV 
 GUARANTY 
 4.01 The Guaranty 
 Subject to Section 4.08, each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each 
 Lender and the Administrative Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the 
 prompt payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory 
 prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance 
 with the terms thereof. Subject to Section 4.08, the Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the 
 Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by 
 acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and 
 severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any 
 extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full 
 when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory 
 cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. 
 Subject to Section 4.08, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any 
 other of the Loan Documents, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement and the other Loan 
 Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render 
 such obligations subject to avoidance under the Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable provisions of any 
 applicable state law. 
 4.02 Obligations Unconditional 
 The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.01 are joint and several, absolute and 
 unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the 
 Loan Documents, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release, 
 impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Obligations, and, to the 
 fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might 
 otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense (other than a defense of payment) of a 
 surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.02 that the obligations of the Guarantors 
 hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees 
 that such Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution 
 against the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Article IV until such time as the 
 Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitment have expired or terminated. Without limiting the 
 generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the 

91

 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
 10.01 Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent 
 Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Bank of America to act as 
 the Administrative Agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under 
 the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such actions and powers 
 and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan 
 Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any 
 provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative 
 Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the 
 Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or 
 participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be 
 read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative 
 Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term agent herein and 
 in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any 
 fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. 
 Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an 
 administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. The provisions of this Article X are 
 solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and neither the Borrower nor any Loan 
 Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions. 
 10.02 Delegation of Duties 
 The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers 
 under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, sub-agents, employees or 
 attorneys-in-fact, in each case appointed by the Administrative Agent and shall be entitled to advice of 
 counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The 
 Administrative Agent and any such agent, sub-agent, employee or attorney-in-fact may perform any and 
 all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Agent-Related Persons. 
 The exculpatory provisions of this Article X shall apply to any such agent, sub-agent, employee or 
 attorney-in-fact and to the Agent-Related Persons of the Administrative Agent and any such agent, sub- 
 agent, employee or attorney-in-fact and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the 
 syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The 
 Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, sub-agent, 
 employee or attorney-in-fact, except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a 
 final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful 
 misconduct in the selection of such agent, sub-agent, employee or attorney-in-fact. 
 10.03 Liability of Administrative Agent 
 No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of

 duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any 

135 

recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof, contained 
 herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred 
 to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this 
 Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or 
 sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any 
 other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related 
 Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the 
 observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any 
 other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate 
 thereof. 
 10.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent

 upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, 
 affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation

 Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), 
 independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative 
 Agent also shall be entitled to rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it 
 to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and 
 upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent 
 accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent, and shall not incur any liability for 
 relying thereon. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action 
 under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders 
 as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders 
 against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to 
 take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in 
 refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or 
 consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby 
 in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding 
 upon all the Lenders. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan 
 that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume 
 that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received 
 notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.

 The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of 
 any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be

 have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such 
 Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. The Administrative Agent will notify the 
 Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to 
 such Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article IX provided , 
 however , that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the 
 Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such 
 action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

 Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material 
 information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent and the Joint Book 
 Runners that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on 
 such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal

 and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other 
 regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into 
 this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, 
 independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and

 make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, 
 property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. 
 Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the 
 Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to 
 provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,

 Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless 
 each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it provided , 
 however , that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of 
 such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of 
 competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related Person s own gross negligence or willful 
 misconduct provided , however , that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required 
 Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. 
 Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand 
 for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the 
 Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, 

137

 of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan 
 Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative 
 Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this 
 Section 10.07 shall survive termination of the Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the

 existence of an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or

 the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with 
 any applicable Law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the 
 Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with 
 respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a 
 ratable basis that would vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the 
 liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset 
 or assets so purchased (or in the Capital Stock or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles 
 that are used to consummate such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative 
 Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (ii) to adopt documents 
 providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the 
 Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the 
 assets or Capital Stock thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required 
 Lenders, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on 
 actions by the Required Lenders contained in clauses (a) through (h) of Section 11.01 of this Agreement), 
 and (iii) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire 
 Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of 

139 

Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition 
 vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and the 
 Capital Stock and or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the Obligations that 
 had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any 
 Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. 
 10.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters

 payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations), (ii) that is 
 transferred or to be transferred to a Person that is not a Loan Party as part of or in connection with

 Assignee upon consummation of the Ventas Purchase Option and the Ventas Purchase Option 
 Assignment and 
 (f) to release the Liens on the assets and properties of the Tenant Subsidiaries 
 subject to the Ventas Asset Purchase upon consummation of the Ventas Asset Purchase. 
 Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in 
 writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or 
 items of Property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this 
 Section 10.11 . 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Lender acknowledges and agrees that upon 
 the consummation of the Ventas Purchase Option and the Ventas Purchase Option Assignment, the Term 
 Loans held by such Lenders shall no longer receive the benefit of any guarantees or Collateral from the 
 Tenant Subsidiaries.

 Agent), the Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold from any payment to any Lender under any 
 Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue 
 Service or any authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative 
 Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the 
 appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify 
 the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, 
 withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the 
 Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the 
 Borrower pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04 and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) 
 fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, 
 together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket 
 expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant 
 Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any 
 Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby 
 authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such 
 Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative 
 Agent under this Section 10.16 . The agreements in this Section 10.16 shall survive the resignation and or

 Amount, then in any such event, each Credit Party receiving a Rescindable Amount severally agrees to 
 repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount received by such Credit 
 Party in immediately available funds in the currency so received, with interest thereon, for each day from 
 and including the date such Rescindable Amount is received by it to but excluding the date of payment to 
 the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the 
 Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Each Credit

 to such Credit Party comprised, in whole or in part, a Rescindable Amount.

 whether or not any such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its 
 equity holders, its Affiliates, its creditors or any other Person provided that such indemnity shall not, as

 indemnification obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. All amounts due under this 
 Section 11.05 shall be payable within thirty days after written demand therefor with reasonably detailed 
 supporting backup documentation provided , however , that such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such

 terms of this Section 11.05 . The agreements in this Section 11.05 shall survive the resignation of the 
 Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the

 fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the 
 Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other 
 party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent

 remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the 
 case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in

 thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 11.07 , from and after the 
 effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a

 such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Term Note to 
 the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this

 this Section 11.07 . 

151

 Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register 
 pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding 
 notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information

 directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such 
 Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification 
 or waiver of any provision of this Agreement provided that such agreement or instrument may provide 
 that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other 
 modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that directly affects such Participant. Each 
 Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the 
 Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the 
 principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of each participant s interest in the Loans and or 
 Commitment held by it (the Participant Register provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to 
 disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any 
 information relating to a Participant s interest in any Loan, Commitment, or its other obligations under 
 any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that 
 such Loan, Commitment, or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the 
 extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan, Commitment, or other obligation is in 
 registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant 
 Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name

 requirements and limitations of such Section and Section 11.16 , and it being understood that the 
 documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered solely to the participating Lender) to the 
 same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) 
 of this Section 11.07 . To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Participant also shall be entitled to 
 the benefits of Section 11.09 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to 
 Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender. 

152 

(e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 
 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold 
 to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s 
 prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
 (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of 
 its rights under this Agreement (including under its Term Note, if any) to secure obligations of such

 respect of its Loans required to be delivered to Lenders), or (iii) make or bring (or participate in, other

 Documents.

 of the Term Loans of consenting Lenders included in determining whether the Required 
 Lenders have consented to any action pursuant to Section 11.01 . 
 Additionally, the Loan Parties and each Non-Debt Fund Affiliate hereby agree that if a case under Title 
 11 of the United States Code is commenced against any Loan Party, such Loan Party shall seek (and each 
 Non-Debt Fund Affiliate shall consent) to provide that the vote of any Non-Debt Fund Affiliate (in its 
 capacity as a Lender) with respect to any plan of reorganization of such Loan Party shall not be counted 
 except that such Non-Debt Fund Affiliate s vote (in its capacity as a Lender) may be counted to the extent 
 any such plan of reorganization proposes to treat the Obligations held by such Non-Debt Fund Affiliate in 

154 

a manner that is less favorable in any material respect to such Non-Debt Fund Affiliate than the proposed 
 treatment of similar Obligations held by Lenders that are not Affiliates of the Borrower. Each Non-Debt 
 Fund Affiliate hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled 
 with an interest) as such Non-Debt Fund Affiliate s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and

 directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being 
 understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature 
 of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential) (b) to the extent requested by 
 any regulatory or self-regulatory authority (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or 
 by any subpoena or similar legal process (in which case, except in the case of routine regulatory 
 examinations or audits, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to inform the Borrower promptly 
 thereof prior to such disclosure to the extent practicable and not prohibited by law or regulation) (d) to 
 any other party to this Agreement (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any

 respective officers, employees, managers advisors (financial and legal) and investors, any of its rights or 
 obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any pledgee referred to in Section 11.07(f) or (iii) any direct or 
 indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty s or 
 prospective counterparty s professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations 
 of the Loan Parties (g) with the consent of the Borrower (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes 
 publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.08 or (ii) becomes available to the 
 Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Loan Parties 
 or (i) to the NAIC or any other similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that 
 requires access to information about a Lender s or its Affiliates investment portfolio in connection with 
 ratings issued with respect to such Lender or its Affiliates. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the 
 Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market 
 data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the 
 Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration, management and assignment 
 of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Borrowings. For the purposes 
 of this Section 11.08 , Information means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any 
 Loan Party or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent 
 or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party. Any Person required to 
 maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.08 shall be considered to have 
 complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the 
 confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.08 shall prohibit the Administrative Agent from 

155 

posting the list of Disqualified Institutions on a SyndTrak, IntraLinks or similar site to which the Lenders 
 have been granted access. 
 11.09 Setoff 
 In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and 
 during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender and any Affiliate of any Lender is 
 authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan 
 Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan 
 Party) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general 
 or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time 
 owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all 
 Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter 
 existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand 
 under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether the Loan Parties are otherwise 
 fully secured and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a 
 currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to 
 notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such 
 Lender provided , however , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff 
 and application. 
 11.10 Interest Rate Limitation 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or 
 agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest 
 permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate ). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall 
 receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the 
 principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining 
 whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds 
 the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any 
 payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary 
 prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal 
 parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

 original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement, any 
 Loan Document and each Communication, including Communications required to be in writing, may be 
 in the form of an Electronic Record (as defined below) and may be executed using Electronic Signatures 
 (as defined below). Each of the Loan Parties and each of the Secured Parties agrees that any Electronic 
 Signature on or associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on such Person to the 
 same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered into by Electronic 
 Signature will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person enforceable against such 
 Person in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original 
 signature was delivered. Any Communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or 
 convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the 
 same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include, 
 without limitation, use or acceptance of a manually signed paper Communication which has been 
 converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed 

156 

Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and or retention. The 
 Administrative Agent and each of the Secured Parties may, at its option, create one or more copies of any 
 Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record Electronic Copy ), which shall be deemed 
 created in the ordinary course of such Person s business, and destroy the original paper document. All 
 Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered 
 an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper 
 record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is not under 
 any obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to 
 by such Person pursuant to procedures approved by it provided , further, without limiting the foregoing, 
 (i) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the 
 Administrative Agent and each of the Secured Parties shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic 
 Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Party and or any Secured Party without further 
 verification and (ii) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party, any Electronic 
 Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed, original counterpart. For purposes hereof, 
 Electronic Record and Electronic Signature shall have the meanings assigned to them, respectively, 
 by 15 USC 7006, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 11.12 Integration 
 This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated 
 agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, 
 written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this 
 Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control 
 provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the 
 Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan 
 Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed 
 neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. 
 11.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties 
 All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document shall survive 
 the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be 
 relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the 
 Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent 
 or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall

 11.16 Replacement of Lenders 
 Under any circumstances set forth in the second paragraph of this Section 11.16 or elsewhere in 
 this Agreement providing that the Borrower shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party to this 
 Agreement, the Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, replace such 
 Lender by causing such Lender to assign its Commitment and outstanding Loans (with the assignment fee 
 to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) pursuant to Section 11.07(b) to one or more other Lenders or 
 Eligible Assignees procured by the Borrower (each such Lender or Eligible Assignee, a Replacement 
 Lender ). The Borrower shall (x) pay in full all principal, interest, fees, premiums and other amounts 
 owing to such Lender through the date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant to 
 Section 3.05 ), and (y) release such Lender from its obligations under the Loan Documents. Any Lender 
 being replaced shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender s 
 Commitment and outstanding Loans provided that the failure by such replaced Lender to execute and 
 deliver an Assignment and Assumption shall not impair the validity of the removal of such replaced 
 Lender and the mandatory assignment of a replaced Lender s Commitments and outstanding Loans 
 pursuant to this Section 11.16 shall nevertheless be effective without the execution by such replaced 
 Lender of an Assignment and Assumption. 
 If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination to any of the 
 provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by clauses (b) through (g), inclusive, of the first proviso in 
 Section 11.01 , the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of such 
 other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then the Borrower shall have the right to replace 
 each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to this 
 Section 11.16 so long as at the time of such replacement, each such Replacement Lender consents to the 
 proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination.
