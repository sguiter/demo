There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. 8 Table of Contents of the Company s common shares, advanced and , respectively, to the Company for operating expenses.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. When used in this Quarterly Report, the words may, will, expect, anticipate, continue, estimate, project, intend, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, operating results, and financial position. Persons reviewing this Quarterly Report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors are discussed further below and also include general economic factors and conditions that may directly or indirectly impact our financial condition or results of operations. Plan of Operation Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a going concern engaged in any industry selected. During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining our good standing or the payment of expenses associated with legal fees, accounting fees and reviewing or investigating any potential business venture, which may be advanced by management or principal stockholders as loans to us. Because we have not determined any business or industry in which our operations will be commenced, and we have not identified any prospective venture as of the date of this Annual Report, it is impossible to predict the amount of any such loan. Any such loan will be on terms no less favorable to us than would be available from a commercial lender in an arm s length transaction. No advance or loan from any affiliate will be required to be repaid as a condition to any agreement with future acquisition partners.

The Company, which has not generated any revenues, has incurred net losses, has net current liabilities and a stockholders deficit. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is dependent on advances from its principal shareholders or other affiliated parties for continued funding. There are no commitments or guarantees from any third party to provide such funding nor is there any guarantee that the Company will be able to access the funding it requires to continue its operations.
