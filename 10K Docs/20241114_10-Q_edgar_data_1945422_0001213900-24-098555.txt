Initial Shareholders have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Shares, and Public
Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an
amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation

(iv) provide for the right of a holder of the Company s
Class B Ordinary Shares, par value per share, to convert into Class A Ordinary Shares, par value per share, of the Company
on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder 

Specifically, with regard to the Extension Proposal,
on September 26, 2024, the shareholders approved the amendment to the Articles and Memorandum of Association Amended and Restated
Amended and Restated ), pursuant to which the Company has the right to extend the time to complete a business combination six (6)
times for an additional one (1) month each time from September 28, 2024 to March 28, 2025 by depositing into the trust account 
for each one-month extension. On September 28, 2024 and October 28, 2024, the Company issued two unsecured promissory notes, each in an

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period,
the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company.
There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period.
As a result, management has determined that such additional condition also raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

The
military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic
sanctions, and a series of terror attacks commenced in October 2023 by Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrating
Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and the ensuing war between the State of Israel and Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya
(Islamic Resistance Movement) or Hamas, could trigger global geopolitical, trade, political, or sanctions risks, as well
as the risk of regional or international expansion of the conflict, including isolated conflicts or terrorist attacks outside of the
immediate conflict area, as a result of which the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of
a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In
addition, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing
which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party
financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world
economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business
Combination are not yet determinable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

share, one right Public Right ), and redeemable warrant Public Warrant ). Each Public Right will convert
into one-sixth (1/6) of a share of Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial Business Combination. Each Public Warrant
entitles the holder to purchase share of Class A ordinary share at a price of per share, subject to adjustment, and each six
rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one share of Class A ordinary share at the closing of an initial Business Combination. The
Company will not issue fractional shares. As a result, Public Rights may only be converted in multiples of six. The Warrants will become
exercisable on the later of the 30 days after completion of the Company s initial Business Combination or 12 months from
the closing of the IPO, and will expire five years after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination or earlier
upon redemption or liquidation. 

Private Units at a price of per Private Unit for an
aggregate purchase price of in a private placement. The Private Units are identical to the Public Units except with respect
to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions. The Private Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants, except that
the Private Warrants will be entitled to registration rights, and the Private Warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable
upon the exercise of the Private Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the completion of a Business Combination,
except to permitted transferees. The proceeds from the Private Units were added to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust
Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within 12 months (or up to 21 months, as described in more
detail in Note 1), the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject
to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Units and all underlying securities will expire worthless.

Class B ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of . On February
10, 2023, our sponsor surrendered, and we cancelled, an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares held by our sponsor pursuant to
a share surrender agreement dated January 13, 2023. The Initial Shareholders have agreed to forfeit up to Founder Shares to the
extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised in full so that the Initial Shareholders collectively own of the number of
Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding shares upon completion of the Proposed Public Offering (assuming
the Initial Shareholders do not purchase any Public Shares in the IPO and excluding the Private Units). On March 28, 2023, the underwriters
over-allotment was exercised in full upon our initial public offering and none of the founder shares were subject to forfeiture.

presented. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding.

 shares to Fen Zhang, our former CEO and Chairman of the board of directors, and shares to each of our independent directors
including John O Donnell, Mitchell Cariaga, and Lauren Simmons. The transfer of the founders shares from the sponsor to Space Frontier
Investment Holding Limited and our directors included restrictions on the sale or transfer of those shares, as well as other rights and
obligations, identical to that between us and our sponsor, except that only our sponsor is obligated to forfeit shares in the event that
no over-allotment option is exercised in connection with the closing of our initial public offering. 

The
sponsor, as well as our advisor Space Frontier Investment Holding Limited, and our current and past directors have agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell its founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the date of the consummation of the Company s
Initial Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of the Company s Class A ordinary shares equals
or exceeds per Class A ordinary share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations)
for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing six months after our initial business combination. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record share-based compensation expenses for ordinary shares assigned
to initial board of directors and Space Frontier Investment Holding Limited, because the Initial Business Combination is not considered
probable until it occurs.

the Company and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, until after the consummation by the Company of an initial Business Combination.

long as they are held by their initial purchasers or any of permitted transferees thereof. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, the Company had no working capital loans due to the sponsor or its affiliates.

Rights
 Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a right will
automatically receive one-sixth (1/6) of a share of Class A ordinary share upon consummation of the Company s initial Business
Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares of Class A ordinary share held by it in connection with the initial
Business Combination or an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation with respect to the Company s pre-business
combination activities. In the event the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion of its initial Business Combination,
each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive the one-sixth (1/6) of a share underlying
each right upon consummation of the Business Combination. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights
in order to receive its additional shares of Class A ordinary share upon consummation of an initial Business Combination. The shares
issuable upon exchange of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company
enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which it will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement
will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the Class A ordinary share will receive
in the transaction on an as-converted into Class A ordinary share basis. 

The
Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the
nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. As a
result, a holder must hold rights in multiples of six in order to receive shares for all of its rights upon closing of a Business Combination.
If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period and it liquidates the funds held
in the Trust Account, holders of warrants and rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants and rights, nor
will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants and
rights, and the warrants and rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities
to the holders of the rights upon consummation of an initial Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required
to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, the warrants and rights may expire worthless.

to certain adjustments, at any time commencing on the later of (i) 12 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering,
or (ii) 30 days after the completion of the Company s Initial Business Combination. 

However,
no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of
Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of Class A
ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise
of the warrants is not effective within 120 days from the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may,
until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain
an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of
the Securities Act provided that such exemption is available. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be
able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of the Company initial
Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

In
addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising
purposes in connection with the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than 
per share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors and,
in the case of any such issuance to the Company s initial shareholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any founders 
shares held by the Company s initial shareholders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate
gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding
of the Company s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination
(net of redemptions), and (z) the Market Value is below per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to
the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption
trigger price described below will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly
Issued Price. 

The
Company may call the warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of per warrant: 

at
any time while the warrants are exercisable, 

upon
not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder, 

if,
and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share, for any 20 trading days within
a 30 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders (the Force-Call
Provision ), and 

if,
and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants
at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the
date of redemption. 

If
the Company calls the warrants for redemption, the Company s management will have the option to require all holders that wish to
exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering
the warrants for that number of shares of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product
of the number of shares of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price
of the warrants and the fair market value by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall
mean the average reported last sale price of Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading
day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.

Warrants are recognized as warrant liabilities and subsequently measured at fair value. 

The
private warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in the Initial
Public Offering except that the private warrants will be subject to certain transfer restrictions and registration rights. The private
warrants will be exercisable (even if a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such
warrants is not effective) on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and will not be redeemable by us, in each case so long
as they are still held by the initial purchasers or their affiliates. The private warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares
issuable upon exercise of the private warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion
of our initial business combination except to permitted transferees.

Initial
Measurement 

The
fair value of the Private Warrants was estimated using Binomial Model on March 28, 2023. 

The
Private Warrants were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs.
The estimated fair value of the Private Warrants is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions related
to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of
its ordinary shares based on historical and implied volatilities of select peer companies as well as its own that matches the expected
remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for
a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their
remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero.

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from March 11,
2022 (inception) through September 30, 2024 have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public
Offering and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate
any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generated non-operating income in the form
of interest income on cash and cash equivalents, and on investments held in Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public
company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
March 28, 2023, we consummated the initial public offering IPO of 5,750,000 units (the Public Units ), including
the full exercise of the over-allotment option of 750,000 Units granted to the underwriters. The Public Units were sold at an offering
price of 10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of 57,500,000. Simultaneously with the IPO, we sold to our Sponsor 343,125 units
at 10.00 per unit (the Private Units in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of 3,431,250. Each Unit
consists of one share of Class A ordinary share, par value 0.0001 per share (the Shares ), one redeemable warrant entitling
its holder to purchase one Share at a price of 11.50 per Share, and one right to receive one-sixth (1/6) of one share upon the consummation
of our initial business combination. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,134,653, which was due to net income of 287,416,
adjusting interest income of 2,389,292 earned on trust account and changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of 400, and changes
in operating assets and liabilities of 966,823. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 491,069, which was due to net income of 1,054,436,
adjusting interest income of 1,465,540 earned on trust account and changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of 43,900, and changes
in operating assets and liabilities of 36,065. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 90,868 and 367,321, respectively, held outside the Trust Account. We intend
to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate
and complete an initial business combination. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital deficit of
 3,231,180. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company
and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital
deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain
of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working
Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a Business Combination, it would repay such loaned amounts at that time. Up to 1,151,000
of such Working Capital Loans may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into units at a price of 10.00 per unit. Such
units would be identical to the Private Units. 

On
August 11, 2023, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Merger Agreement with Oak
Woods Merger Sub, Inc., a Cayman Islands corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), Huajin
(China) Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands corporation Huajin and Xuehong Li, in his capacity as the representative
of the Huajin shareholders Shareholders Representative or otherwise hereinafter referred to as Founder ).
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, Merger
Sub will merge with and into Huajin (the Merger ), with Huajin surviving the merger in accordance with the Companies Act
(As Revised) of the Cayman Islands as a wholly- owned subsidiary of the Company (the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and the related ancillary agreements, the Business Combination ). In connection with the Business Combination, Huajin made
a deposit of 330,969 to the Company. The Company recorded the deposit in the account of deposit from the target company 
on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The
Company has filed an 8-K announcing the Merger Agreement on August 11, 2023 and preliminary proxy solicitation statements with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2024 and March 7, 2024, thereby automatically extending the Company s minimum
time to complete a Business Combination under the terms of its Memorandum and Articles of Association until June 28, 2024.

On
June 28, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the amount of 575,000 to the Company s Sponsor, Whale Bay International
Company Limited, which has timely deposited 575,000 in the Company s trust account, representing 0.10 per unit as additional
interest on the proceeds in the trust account in order to extend the amount of time it has available to complete a business combination

on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder 

Specifically, with regard to the Extension Proposal,
on September 26, 2024, the shareholders approved the amendment to the Articles and Memorandum of Association Amended and Restated
Amended and Restated ), pursuant to which the Company has the right to extend the time to complete a business combination six (6)
times for an additional one (1) month each time from September 28, 2024 to March 28, 2025 by depositing into the trust account 172,500
for each one-month extension. On September 28, 2024 and October 28, 2024, the Company issued two unsecured promissory notes, each in an
amount of 172,500, to the Sponsor in exchange for Sponsor depositing such amount into the Company s trust account in order to extend
the amount of time it has available to complete a business combination until November 28, 2024. In addition, the promissory note of 575,000
issued in June 2024 was also extended and is payable on the earlier of (i) March 28, 2025, or (ii) the date on which Maker consummates
its business combination with Huajin. In the event that a Business Combination does not close by November 28, 2024, or up to March 28,
2025 and no amounts will thereafter be due thereon. 

In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders
to vote on extending the Combination Period, on September 26, 2024, 1,492,646 Class A ordinary shares were redeemed at a per share price
of 11.08. On October 4, 2024, 16,541,342 was paid from the Trust Account to redeeming shareholders in connection with the extension.
As a result, the Company has recorded a liability of 16,541,342 as Class A ordinary shares to be redeemed and reduced Class A ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption as of September 30, 2024 on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

In connection with the Company s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined
that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company
is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence
a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate
a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such additional condition
also raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on
the Trust Account, excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that capital
stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held
in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue growth strategies. If an initial business combination agreement requires the Company to use a portion of the cash in the Trust
Account to pay the purchase price or requires the Company to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the Company will need to reserve
a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often
referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt
or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.

Administrative
Services Agreement 

The
Company is obligated, commencing on March 23, 2023, to pay the sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for general and administrative services.
However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, the Company may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by the audit
committee that the Company lacks sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with the
initial Business Combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the
consummation of our initial Business Combination. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company accrued administrative service expenses of 30,000 and 30,000, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company accrued administrative service expenses of 90,000 and 60,000, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had service fee payable of 180,000 and 90,000, respectively, due to the
sponsor. 

Underwriting
Ag reement 

The
Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial
Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, which the underwriter partially exercised in full, and the additional
Units were issued on March 23, 2023. 

The
underwriter was paid a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 1,150,000 in the aggregate. In addition, the underwriter is
entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 2,012,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter
from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms
of the underwriting agreement. 

Financial
Advisory Agreement 

The
Company engaged Asian Legend International Investment Holding Limited AsianLegend as the Company s advisor in connection
with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its shareholders to discuss the potential Business Combination
and the target business attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing the Company s
securities, assist the Company in obtaining shareholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with press releases
and public filings in connection with the Business Combination simultaneously upon the firm commitment of this offering. Under the Merger
Agreement and the agreement entered into between AsianLegend and the Company, with the consent of Huajin, The Company will pay AsianLegend
a cash fee of 100,000 per month, from the month AsianLegend started consulting services to the date of Closing of the Business Combination
for such services, plus Class A Ordinary Shares issued to AsianLegend upon the consummation of a Business Combination. The number
of Class A Ordinary Shares to be issued to Asian Legend is calculated at 5 of the number of Class A Ordinary Shares to be issued to
the Huajin shareholders upon the consummation of a Business Combination. AsianLegend started to provide consulting services in October
2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued consulting service expenses of 1,200,000 and 300,000,
respectively. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We
prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs
and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We have
identified the following critical accounting estimates: 

Warrant
Liability 

We
classify private warrants as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With
each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in our statement
of operations. The fair value of our Private Placement Warrants requires significate estimates by management. Deviations from these estimates
could result in a significate difference to our financial results.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

On
December 14, 2023, the FASB issued a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information
about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended
to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. ASU
2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, applies to all entities subject to income taxes. For public business entities (PBEs),
the new requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities other than public business
entities (non-PBEs), the requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The guidance will be applied
on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing
the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, Mr. Lixin Zheng, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.
Based upon his evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective.

in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our final prospectus
filed with the SEC on March 24, 2023, our preliminary proxy statements on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on February 12, March 7, September
3, September 16, and September 25, 2024, and our registration statements on Form S-4 and Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on June 14, June
17, July 1, August 21 and October 10, 2024. 

As
of the date of this Report, other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final
prospectus filed with the SEC. 

The
military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic
sanctions, and a series of terror attacks commenced in October 2023 by Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrating
Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and the ensuing war between the State of Israel and Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya
(Islamic Resistance Movement) or Hamas, could trigger global geopolitical, trade, political, or sanctions risks, as well
as the risk of regional or international expansion of the conflict, including isolated conflicts or terrorist attacks outside of the
immediate conflict area, as a result of which the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of
a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On
March 28, 2023, we consummated our IPO of 5,750,000 units (the Public Units ), which includes the full exercise of the underwriter s
over-allotment option of 750,000 Public Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Ordinary Share Class A Ordinary Share ),
one redeemable warrant Warrant entitling its holder to purchase one share of Class A Ordinary Share at a price of 11.50
per share, and one right Right to receive one-sixth (1/6) of a share of Class A Ordinary Share upon the consummation
of an initial business combination. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds
of 57,500,000. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO on March 28, 2023, we consummated the private placement Private Placement with Whale Bay
International Company Limited, our Sponsor, purchasing units (the Private Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit,
generating total proceeds of 3,431,250. 

The
terms of the Private Units are identical to the Public Units except that the purchaser in the Private Placement agreed not to transfer,
assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement)
until the completion of the Company s initial business combination; the purchaser was granted certain demand and piggyback registration
rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units; the purchaser agreed to certain voting restrictions and agreed to vote the
underlying shares of Class A Ordinary Share in favor of any proposed initial business combination; and the purchaser agreed to not redeem
the underlying shares of Class A Ordinary Share. 

The
Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve
a public offering. 

On
March 28, 2023, a total of 58,506,250 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account
established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders and maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company,
