 Allocation of purchase price Current assets Oil and natural gas properties Evaluated Unproved and unevaluated Midstream assets Equity method investment Current liabilities ) Asset retirement obligations ) Net assets acquired 
 The fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent Level 3 inputs. The fair value of evaluated oil and gas properties and asset retirement obligations were measured using the discounted cash flow technique of valuation. 
 Significant inputs to the valuation of oil and gas properties include estimates of: (i) future production volumes, (ii) future commodity prices and (iii) recent market comparable transactions for unproved acreage. These inputs require significant judgments and estimates and are the most sensitive and subject to change. 
 The results of operations for the Ameredev Acquisition since the closing date have been included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The oil and natural gas production from Ameredev increased the Company s revenues and net income for the period from September 18, 2024 through September 30, 2024 by million and million, respectively. 
 Pro Forma Information 
 The following unaudited pro forma financial information represents a summary of the condensed consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, assuming the Ameredev Acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2023. The pro forma financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of the Company would have been had the Ameredev Acquisition occurred on the dates noted above, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of operations or consolidated financial position of the Company. Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected because of various factors.

 On September 18, 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary completed the acquisition of Ameredev from affiliates of EnCap Investments L.P., including (i) certain oil and natural gas producing properties and undeveloped acreage located in Lea County, New Mexico and Loving and Winkler Counties, Texas, and (ii) an approximate 19 stake in the parent company of Pi on, which has midstream assets in southern Lea County, New Mexico. The Ameredev Acquisition had an effective date of June 1, 2024 and an aggregate as-adjusted closing purchase price of approximately 1.831 billion in cash, which amount is subject to customary post-closing adjustments, of which approximately 95.3 million was deposited in escrow in connection with the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2024. The purchase price for the Ameredev Acquisition was funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our existing secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement ), which was amended on September 18, 2024 to, among other things: (i) provide for a term loan of 250.0 million, the full amount of which was borrowed to fund the Ameredev Acquisition, and (ii) increase the elected borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility from 1.50 billion to 2.25 billion. On September 25, 2024, we completed the sale of 750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25 senior unsecured notes due 2033 (the 2033 Notes and used the net proceeds to partially repay borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, including all of the 250.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the term loan. The results of operations for the Ameredev Acquisition since the closing date of September 18, 2024 have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. On August 21, 2024, Pi on announced that it expects to be acquired by an affiliate of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals. We currently expect to receive between 110.0 million and 120.0 million from the sale of Pi on and we expect to use these proceeds to reduce borrowings under our Credit Agreement. See Note 3 to the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for more information regarding the Ameredev Acquisition.

 O perations Update 
 We began 2024 operating seven drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin. We added an eighth operated drilling rig in the first quarter of 2024 and a ninth operated drilling rig late in the second quarter of 2024. Prior to the closing of the Ameredev Acquisition, Ameredev was operating one drilling rig, and upon the consummation of the Ameredev Acquisition, we continued operating a total of nine drilling rigs for the combined Matador and Ameredev properties covering approximately 196,200 net acres. We have built significant optionality into our drilling program, which should generally allow us to decrease or increase the number of rigs we operate as necessary based on changing commodity prices and other factors. 
 Our average daily oil equivalent production in the Delaware Basin for the third quarter of 2024 was 167,000 BOE per day, consisting of 99,600 Bbl of oil per day and 404.0 MMcf of natural gas per day, a 28 increase from 130,400 BOE per day, consisting of 76,800 Bbl of oil per day and 321.6 MMcf of natural gas per day, in the third quarter of 2023. These increases were primarily attributable to the increased number of wells being operated by us and by other operators where we own a working interest. The Delaware Basin contributed approximately 99 of our daily oil production and approximately 95 of our daily natural gas production in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to approximately 99 of our daily oil production and approximately 93 of our daily natural gas production in the third quarter of 2023. 
 In March 2024, we completed our natural gas pipeline connections between Pronto and San Mateo and between Pronto and Matador s acreage obtained in the Advance Acquisition. These connector pipelines provide further flow assurance and options for Matador and third-party customer natural gas. 
 At September 30, 2024, Pronto s midstream system included a cryogenic natural gas processing plant with a designed inlet processing capacity of 60 MMcf per day (the Marlan Processing Plant ), four compressor stations and approximately 115 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in Eddy and Lea Counties, New Mexico, spanning from the northeastern portion of the Arrowhead asset area into the Ranger asset area. Pronto has begun construction on an additional natural gas processing plant with a designed inlet processing capacity of 200 MMcf per day, including a nitrogen rejection unit and additional related facilities, to expand the Marlan Processing Plant. 
 2024 Capital Expenditure Budget 
 On October 22, 2024, we increased our estimated drilling, completing and equipping D/C/E capital expenditures for 2024 to a range of 1.15 to 1.35 billion from a range of 1.10 to 1.30 billion, which includes our expected D/C/E capital expenditures on acreage acquired in the Ameredev Acquisition. At October 22, 2024, our estimated midstream capital expenditures for 2024 remained 200.0 to 250.0 million, which includes our proportionate share of San Mateo s estimated 2024 capital expenditures as well as the estimated 2024 capital expenditures for other wholly-owned midstream projects, including projects completed by Pronto. The midstream capital expenditure budget includes 100 of the costs associated with the Marlan Processing Plant expansion, although, at October 22, 2024, we were continuing to evaluate potential partners in Pronto that would share in these capital expenditures and strategic opportunities. The midstream capital expenditure budget excludes the acquisition cost of Ameredev s midstream assets 
 Capital Resources Update 
 Matador s Board of Directors (the Board declared quarterly cash dividends of 0.20 per share of common stock in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2024. On October 16, 2024, the Board amended our dividend policy to increase the quarterly dividend to 0.25 per share of common stock for future dividend payments and also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per share of common stock payable on December 6, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2024. 
 On March 22, 2024, we and our lenders entered into an amendment to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) reaffirm the borrowing base at 2.50 billion, (ii) increase the elected borrowing commitments from 1.325 billion to 1.50 billion, (iii) increase the maximum facility amount from 2.00 billion to 3.50 billion, (iv) extend the maturity date from October 31, 2026 to March 22, 2029, (v) appoint PNC Bank, National Association as administrative agent thereunder and (vi) add five new banks to the lending group. This March 2024 reaffirmation of the borrowing base constituted the regularly scheduled May 1 redetermination. 
 On March 28, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,250,000 shares of our common stock (the 2024 Equity Offering ). After deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately 342.1 million. The net proceeds from the 2024 Equity Offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Oil and natural gas revenues. Our oil and natural gas revenues increased 68.6 million, or 10 , to 770.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 701.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our oil revenues increased 110.0 million, or 19 , to 698.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 588.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in oil revenues resulted from a 29 increase in our oil production to 9.2 million Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.1 million Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by an 8 decrease in the weighted average oil price realized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 75.67 per Bbl, as compared to 82.49 per Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our natural gas revenues decreased 41.4 million, or 37 , to 71.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 113.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in natural gas revenues resulted from a 49 decrease in the weighted average natural gas price realized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 1.83 per Mcf, as compared to a weighted average natural gas price of 3.56 per Mcf realized for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by a 24 increase in our natural gas production to 39.3 Bcf for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 31.8 Bcf for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Third-party midstream services revenues. Our third-party midstream services revenues increased 8.4 million, or 28 , to 38.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 29.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Third-party midstream services revenues are those revenues from midstream operations related to third parties, including working interest owners in our operated wells. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our third-party produced water disposal revenues to 15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in our third-party natural gas gathering and processing revenues to 18.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales of purchased natural gas. Our sales of purchased natural gas increased 11.3 million, or 28 , to 51.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 40.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of an 83 increase in natural gas volumes sold, which was partially offset by a 30 decrease in natural gas price realized. Sales of purchased natural gas reflect those natural gas purchase transactions that we periodically enter into with third parties whereby we purchase natural gas and (i) subsequently sell the natural gas to other purchasers or (ii) process the natural gas at either Pronto s or San Mateo s cryogenic natural gas processing plant and subsequently sell the residue natural gas and NGLs to other purchasers. These revenues, and the expenses related to these transactions included in Purchased natural gas, are presented on a gross basis in our interim unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 Realized gain (loss) on derivatives. Our realized gain on derivatives was 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a realized loss of 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We realized a net gain of 4.5 million related to our natural gas basis differential swap contracts for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting primarily from natural gas basis differentials that were below the fixed prices of certain of our natural gas basis differential swap contracts. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we realized a net loss of 7.0 million related to our natural gas basis differential swap contracts, resulting primarily from natural gas basis differentials that were above the fixed prices of certain of our natural gas basis differential swap contracts. We realized an average gain on our natural gas derivatives of approximately 0.11 per Mcf produced during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an average loss of approximately 0.22 per Mcf produced during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the aggregate net fair value of our open oil costless collar and natural gas basis differential swap contracts changed to a net asset of 28.0 million from a net liability of 7.1 million at June 30, 2024, resulting in an unrealized gain on derivatives of 35.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the aggregate net fair value of our open natural gas basis differential swap contracts changed to a net liability of 4.3 million from a net liability of 11.8 million at June 30, 2023, resulting in an unrealized gain on derivatives of 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Oil and natural gas revenues. Our oil and natural gas revenues increased 457.6 million, or 26 , to 2.25 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.79 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our oil revenues increased 501.9 million, or 33 , to 2.00 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.50 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in oil revenues resulted from a 32 increase in our oil production to 25.6 million Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 19.4 million Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a 1 increase in the weighted average oil price realized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 78.12 per Bbl, as compared to 77.41 per Bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our natural gas revenues decreased by 44.3 million, or 15 , to 247.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 291.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in natural gas revenues resulted from a 33 decrease in the weighted average natural gas price realized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.25 per Mcf, as compared to a weighted average natural gas price of 3.35 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by a 26 increase in our natural gas production to 110.2 Bcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 87.2 Bcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Third-party midstream services revenues. Our third-party midstream services revenues increased 16.8 million, or 19 , to 103.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 86.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our third-party produced water disposal revenues to 42.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 31.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in our oil transportation revenues to 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales of purchased natural gas. Our sales of purchased natural gas increased 40.9 million, or 38 , to 147.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 106.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was the result of a 59 increase in natural gas volumes sold, which was partially offset by a 13 decrease in natural gas price realized.

 Realized gain (loss) on derivatives. Our realized gain on derivatives was 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a realized loss of 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We realized a net gain of 8.6 million related to our natural gas basis differential swap contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting primarily from natural gas basis differentials that were below the fixed prices of our natural gas basis differential swap contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we realized a net loss of 6.5 million related to our natural gas costless collar and natural gas basis differential swap contracts, resulting primarily from natural gas prices that were above the fixed prices of our natural gas basis differential swap contracts, offset by natural gas prices that were below the floor prices of certain of our natural gas costless collar contracts. We realized an average gain on our natural gas derivatives of approximately 0.07 per Mcf produced during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an average loss of approximately 0.08 per Mcf produced during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the aggregate net fair value of our open oil costless collar and natural gas basis differential swap contracts changed to a net asset of 28.0 million from a net asset of 2.7 million at December 31, 2023, resulting in an unrealized gain on derivatives of 25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Production taxes, transportation and processing. Our production taxes and transportation and processing expenses increased 1.0 million, or 1 , to 72.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 71.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 5.4 million increase in production taxes to 60.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 54.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by a 4.3 million decrease in transportation and processing expenses to 12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 16.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in production taxes is primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas revenues between the two periods. On a unit-of-production basis, our production taxes and transportation and processing expenses decreased 20 to 4.61 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.77 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a favorable one-time transportation fee adjustment with a third-party vendor during the third quarter of 2024.

 Lease operating. Our lease operating expenses increased 20.4 million, or 31 , to 86.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 66.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our lease operating expenses on a unit-of-production basis increased 3 to 5.50 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.34 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily attributable to the increased number of wells being operated by us and other operators (where we own a working interest) and to operating cost inflation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Plant and other midstream services operating. Our plant and other midstream services operating expenses increased 12.9 million, or 42 , to 43.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increased throughput volumes from Matador and other San Mateo and Pronto customers, which resulted in (i) increased expenses associated with our expanded pipeline operations of 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) increased expenses associated with our commercial produced water disposal operations of 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depletion, depreciation and amortization. Our depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses increased 50.0 million, or 26 , to 242.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 192.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a 27 increase in our total oil equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. On a unit-of-production basis, our depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 1 to 15.39 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.51 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative . Our general and administrative expenses decreased 2.9 million, or 9 , to 28.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 31.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 29 on a unit-of-production basis to 1.82 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.55 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a 27 increase in our total oil equivalent production between the two periods. 
 Interest expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred total interest expense of 44.4 million. We capitalized 8.2 million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and expensed the remaining 36.2 million to operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred total interest expense of 42.8 million. We capitalized 7.4 million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and expensed the remaining 35.4 million to operations. The increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in our average debt outstanding between the two periods. In April 2024, we completed the 2026 Notes Tender Offer, the 2026 Notes Redemption and the 2032 Notes Offering and in September 2024 we completed the 2033 Notes Offering, resulting in a net increase in our total senior notes outstanding to 2.15 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.20 billion at September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax provision (benefit). We recorded a current income tax benefit of 21.1 million and a deferred income tax provision of 106.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a current income tax provision of 9.0 million and a deferred income tax provision of 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate of 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to permanent differences between book and taxable income and state taxes, primarily in New Mexico. Our effective income tax rate of 5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to recognizing research and experimental expenditure tax credits of 65.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, which were partially offset by permanent differences between book and taxable income and state taxes, primarily in New Mexico. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Production taxes, transportation and processing. Our production taxes, transportation and processing expenses increased 30.5 million, or 16 , to 219.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 189.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a 33.1 million increase in production taxes to 174.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 141.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas revenues between the two periods. On a unit-of-production basis, our production taxes, transportation and processing expenses decreased 11 to 4.99 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.58 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the transportation and processing expense per BOE that resulted from the mix of revenue contracts, including from San Mateo and Pronto, between the two periods. 
 Lease operating expenses. Our lease operating expenses increased 70.3 million, or 41 , to 242.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 171.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our lease

 operating expenses per unit of production increased 8 to 5.50 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.07 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily attributable to the increased number of wells being operated by us, including 127 wells from the Advance Acquisition, and operated by other operators (where we own a working interest) and to operating cost inflation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Plant and other midstream services operating. Our plant and other midstream services operating expenses increased 28.1 million, or 30 , to 120.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 92.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increased throughput volumes from Matador and other San Mateo and Pronto customers, which resulted in (i) increased expenses associated with our expanded pipeline operations of 46.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 30.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) increased expenses associated with our commercial produced water disposal operations of 47.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 38.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depletion, depreciation and amortization. Our depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses increased 184.4 million, or 37 , to 681.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 496.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the Advance Acquisition and the approximate 30 increase in our total oil equivalent production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a unit-of-production basis, our depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses increased 6 to 15.48 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14.64 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the Advance Acquisition. 
 General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses increased 5.5 million, or 7 , to 86.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 80.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increased payroll for our existing employees as well as with additional employees joining Matador to support our increased land, geoscience, drilling, completion, production, midstream and administration functions as a result of our continued growth. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 18 on a unit-of-production basis to 1.96 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.38 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the approximate 30 increase in our total oil equivalent production between the two periods. 
 Interest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred total interest expense of approximately 135.1 million. We capitalized approximately 23.4 million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and expensed the remaining 111.7 million to operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred total interest expense of approximately 101.9 million. We capitalized approximately 16.1 million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and expensed the remaining 85.8 million to operations. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in our average debt outstanding between the two periods. In April 2024, we completed the 2026 Notes Tender Offer, the 2026 Notes Redemption and the 2032 Notes Offering and in September 2024 we completed the 2033 Notes Offering, resulting in a net increase in our total senior notes outstanding to 2.15 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.20 billion at September 30, 2023. In connection with the 2026 Notes Tender Offer, 2026 Notes Redemption and the amendment of our Credit Agreement in March 2024, we also incurred a loss of approximately 5.6 million included in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income tax provision (benefit) . We recorded a current income tax provision of 26.3 million and a deferred income tax provision of 203.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a current income tax provision of 9.0 million and a deferred income tax provision of 119.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate of 26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to permanent differences between book and taxable income and state taxes, primarily in New Mexico. Our effective income tax rate of 18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to recognizing research and experimental expenditure tax credits of 65.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, which were partially offset by permanent differences between book and taxable income and state taxes, primarily in New Mexico. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary use of capital has been, and we expect will continue to be during the remainder of 2024 and for the foreseeable future, for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and for midstream investments. On September 18, 2024, we closed the Ameredev Acquisition that was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Agreement. On August 21, 2024, Pi on announced that it expects to be acquired by an affiliate of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals. We currently expect to receive between 110.0 million and 120.0 million from the sale of Pi on and we expect to use these

 proceeds to reduce borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Excluding the Ameredev Acquisition and any future significant acquisitions, we expect to fund our 2024 capital expenditures through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flows and performance incentives paid to us by Five Point Energy, LLC or its affiliates. If capital expenditures were to exceed our operating cash flows during the remainder of 2024, we expect to fund any such excess capital expenditures, including for significant acquisitions, through borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the San Mateo Credit Facility (assuming availability under such facilities) or through other capital sources, including borrowings under expanded or additional credit arrangements, the sale or joint venture of midstream assets, oil and natural gas producing assets, leasehold interests or mineral interests and potential issuances of equity, debt or convertible securities, none of which may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on our ability to generate operating cash flows and access outside sources of capital. 
 The Board declared quarterly cash dividends of 0.20 per share of common stock in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2024. On October 16, 2024, the Board amended our dividend policy to increase the quarterly dividend to 0.25 per share of common stock for future dividend payments and also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per share of common stock payable on December 6, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2024. 
 On March 22, 2024, we and our lenders entered into an amendment to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) reaffirm the borrowing base at 2.50 billion, (ii) increase the elected borrowing commitments from 1.325 billion to 1.50 billion, (iii) increase the maximum facility amount from 2.00 billion to 3.50 billion, (iv) extend the maturity date from October 31, 2026 to March 22, 2029, (v) appoint PNC Bank, National Association as administrative agent thereunder and (vi) add five new banks to the lending group. This March 2024 reaffirmation of the borrowing base constituted the regularly scheduled May 1 redetermination. 
 On September 18, 2024, we and our lenders entered into an amendment to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) provide for a term loan of 250.0 million, the full amount of which was borrowed to fund the Ameredev Acquisition, and (ii) increase the elected borrowing commitments under our revolving credit facility from 1.50 billion to 2.25 billion. 
 The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (i) a current ratio, which is defined as (x) total consolidated current assets plus the unused availability under the Credit Agreement divided by (y) total consolidated current liabilities less current maturities under the Credit Agreement, of not less than 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter and (ii) a debt to EBITDA ratio, which is defined as debt outstanding (net of cash or cash equivalents of up to the greater of (a) 150.0 million and (b) 10 of the elected commitment), divided by a rolling four quarter EBITDA calculation, of 3.5 or less. We believe that we were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024. 
 On March 28, 2024, we completed the 2024 Equity Offering. After deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately 342.1 million. The net proceeds from the 2024 Equity Offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement. 
 On April 2, 2024, we completed the 2032 Notes Offering. We used the net proceeds from the 2032 Notes Offering of approximately 885.0 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and estimated offering expenses, to fund the 2026 Notes Tender Offer and 2026 Notes Redemption and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repayment of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement. 
 On September 25, 2024, we completed the 2033 Notes Offering. We used the net proceeds from the 2033 Notes Offering of approximately 736.4 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and estimated offering expenses, to partially repay borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, including all of the 250.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the term loan. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash totaling 23.3 million and restricted cash totaling 53.7 million, which was primarily associated with San Mateo. By contractual agreement, the cash in the accounts held by our less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries is not to be commingled with our other cash and is to be used only to fund the capital expenditures and operations of these less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had (i) 500.0 million of outstanding 2028 Notes, (ii) 900.0 million of outstanding 2032 Notes, (iii) 750.0 million of outstanding 2033 Notes, (iv) 955.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement and (v) approximately 52.9 million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Between September 30, 2024 and October 22, 2024, we repaid 65.0 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 
 At September 30, 2024, San Mateo had 526.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the San Mateo Credit Facility and approximately 9.0 million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the San Mateo Credit Facility. Between September 30, 2024 and October 22, 2024, San Mateo repaid 32.0 million of borrowings under the San Mateo Credit Facility.

Table of Contents 

 The outstanding borrowings under the San Mateo Credit Facility mature on December 9, 2026, and lender commitments under the facility were 535.0 million at September 30, 2024. The San Mateo Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, which provides for potential increases in lender commitments of up to 735.0 million. The San Mateo Credit Facility is non-recourse with respect to Matador and its wholly-owned subsidiaries but is guaranteed by San Mateo s subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of San Mateo s assets, including real property. The San Mateo Credit Facility requires San Mateo to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio, which is defined as total consolidated funded indebtedness outstanding (as defined in the San Mateo Credit Facility) divided by a rolling four quarter EBITDA calculation, of 5.00 or less, subject to certain exceptions. The San Mateo Credit Facility also requires San Mateo to maintain an interest coverage ratio, which is defined as a rolling four quarter EBITDA calculation divided by San Mateo s consolidated interest expense for such period, of 2.50 or more. The San Mateo Credit Facility also restricts the ability of San Mateo to distribute cash to its members if San Mateo s liquidity is less than 10 of the lender commitments under the San Mateo Credit Facility. We believe that San Mateo was in compliance with the terms of the San Mateo Credit Facility at September 30, 2024. 
 We expect that development of our Delaware Basin assets will be the primary focus of our operations and capital expenditures for the remainder of 2024. We began 2024 operating seven drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin. We added an eighth operated drilling rig in the first quarter of 2024 and a ninth operated drilling rig late in the second quarter of 2024. Prior to the closing of the Ameredev Acquisition, Ameredev was operating one drilling rig, and upon the consummation of the Ameredev Acquisition, we continued operating a total of nine drilling rigs on the combined Matador and Ameredev properties covering approximately 196,200 net acres. We have built significant optionality into our drilling program, which should generally allow us to decrease or increase the number of rigs we operate as necessary based on changing commodity prices and other factors. On October 22, 2024, we increased our estimated D/C/E capital expenditures for 2024 to a range of 1.15 to 1.35 billion from a range of 1.10 to 1.30 billion, which includes our expected D/C/E capital expenditures on acreage acquired in the Ameredev Acquisition. At October 22, 2024, our estimated midstream capital expenditures for 2024 remained 200.0 to 250.0 million, which includes our proportionate share of San Mateo s estimated 2024 capital expenditures as well as the estimated 2024 capital expenditures for other wholly-owned midstream projects, including projects completed by Pronto. The midstream capital expenditure budget includes 100 of the costs associated with the Marlan Processing Plant expansion noted above, although, at October 22, 2024, we were continuing to evaluate potential partners in Pronto that would share in these capital expenditures and strategic opportunities. The midstream capital expenditure budget excludes the acquisition cost of Ameredev s midstream assets. Substantially all of these 2024 estimated capital expenditures are expected to be allocated to (i) the further delineation and development of our leasehold position, (ii) the construction, installation and maintenance of midstream assets and (iii) our participation in certain non-operated well opportunities in the Delaware Basin, South Texas and Haynesville shale. Our 2024 Delaware Basin operated drilling program is expected to focus on the continued development of our various asset areas throughout the Delaware Basin, with a continued emphasis on drilling and completing a high percentage of longer horizontal wells in 2024, including 99 with anticipated completed lateral lengths of one mile or greater. 
 As we have done in recent years, we may divest portions of our non-core assets, particularly in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and the Haynesville shale in Northwest Louisiana, as well as consider monetizing other assets, such as certain midstream assets and mineral and royalty interests, as value-creating opportunities arise. In addition, during 2024, we intend to continue evaluating the opportunistic acquisition of producing properties, acreage and mineral interests and midstream assets, principally in the Delaware Basin. These monetizations, divestitures and expenditures are opportunity-specific, and purchase price multiples and per-acre prices can vary significantly based on the asset or prospect. As a result, it is difficult to estimate these 2024 monetizations, divestitures and capital expenditures with any degree of certainty; therefore, we have not provided estimated proceeds related to monetizations or divestitures or estimated capital expenditures related to acquiring producing properties, acreage and mineral interests and midstream assets for 2024. 
 Our 2024 capital expenditures may be adjusted as business conditions warrant, and the amount, timing and allocation of such expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. The aggregate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions, the actual costs to drill, complete and place on production operated or non-operated wells, our drilling results, the actual costs and scope of our midstream activities, the ability of our joint venture partners to meet their capital obligations, other opportunities that may become available to us and our ability to obtain capital. When oil or natural gas prices decline, or costs increase significantly, we have the flexibility to defer a significant portion of our capital expenditures until later periods to conserve cash or to focus on projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate near-term cash flows. We routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in prices, availability of financing, drilling, completion and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs, success or lack of success in our exploration and development activities, contractual obligations, drilling plans for properties we do not operate and other factors both within and outside our control. 
 Exploration and development activities are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could cause these activities to be less successful than we anticipate. A significant portion of our anticipated cash flows from operations for the remainder of 2024 is expected to come from producing wells and development activities on currently proved properties in the

 Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin, the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and the Haynesville shale in Northwest Louisiana. Our existing operated and non-operated wells may not produce at the levels we are forecasting or may be temporarily shut in or restricted due to low commodity prices, and our exploration and development activities in these areas may not be as successful as we anticipate. Additionally, our anticipated cash flows from operations are based upon current expectations of oil and natural gas prices for 2024 and the hedges we currently have in place. For further discussion of our expectations of such commodity prices, see General Outlook and Trends below. At times, we use commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices and to partially offset reductions in our cash flows from operations resulting from declines in commodity prices. See Note 8 to the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for a summary of our open derivative financial instruments. 
 Our unaudited cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,671,926 1,249,481 Net cash used in investing activities (3,280,718) (2,662,324) Net cash provided by financing activities 1,579,517 927,687 Net change in cash and restricted cash (29,275) (485,156) Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders (1)

 __________________ 
 (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 422.4 million to 1.67 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.25 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities, net cash provided by operating activities increased 341.1 million to 1.62 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.28 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher oil and natural gas production and higher realized oil prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities between the two periods resulted in a net increase of approximately 81.3 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 618.4 million to 3.28 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.66 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to (i) 1.83 billion in expenditures related to the Ameredev Acquisition in the third quarter of 2024, (ii) an increase between the periods of 201.2 million in expenditures related to the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, (iii) an increase between the periods of 143.6 million in midstream capital expenditures and (iv) an increase between the periods of 50.0 million in D/C/E capital expenditures primarily attributable to our operated and non-operated drilling, completion and equipping activities in the Delaware Basin. These increases were partially offset by a decrease between the periods of 1.61 billion in expenditures related to the Advance Acquisition in the second quarter of 2023.

 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 651.8 million to 1.58 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 927.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary sources of cash from financing activities included (i) proceeds from the 2032 Notes Offering of 900.0 million, (ii) proceeds from the 2033 Notes Offering of 750.0 million, (iii) proceeds from the 2024 Equity Offering of 344.7 million and (iv) net borrowings under the Credit Agreement of 455.0 million. These increases were partially offset by (i) the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of approximately 699.2 million of 2026 Notes, (ii) dividends paid of 73.6 million, (iii) net distributions related to San Mateo of 31.4 million, (iv) costs associated with the 2032 Notes Offering and 2033 Notes Offering of 26.1 million, (v) costs to amend the Credit Agreement of 25.9 million and (vi) payment of taxes related to stock-based compensation of 14.5 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our primary sources of cash from financing activities included proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes of 494.8 million and net borrowings under the Credit Agreement of 530.0 million, partially offset by dividends of 53.5 million, payment of taxes related to stock-based compensation of 22.8 million and net distributions related to San Mateo of 12.9 million. 
 See Note 5 to the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for a summary of our debt, including the Credit Agreement, the San Mateo Credit Facility, the 2028 Notes, the 2032 Notes and the 2033 Notes. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations, property impairments, unrealized derivative gains and losses, non-recurring transaction costs for certain acquisitions, certain other non-cash items and non-cash stock-based compensation expense and net gain or loss on asset sales and impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. 
 Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is necessary because it allows us to evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in calculating Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which certain assets were acquired. 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as a primary indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components of understanding and assessing a company s financial performance, such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. 
 The following table presents our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to Matador shareholders decreased 15.4 million to 248.3 million, as compared to 263.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income attributable to Matador shareholders primarily resulted from increased depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses of 242.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 192.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and an income tax provision of 85.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an income tax provision of 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases to net income were partially offset by higher oil and natural gas production for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by lower realized oil and natural gas prices.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to Matador shareholders increased 79.3 million to 670.8 million, as compared to net income attributable to Matador shareholders of 591.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net income attributable to Matador shareholders primarily resulted from higher oil and natural gas production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were partially offset by increased depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses of 681.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 496.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, increased lease operating expense of 242.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 171.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, increased interest expense of 111.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 85.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an income tax provision of 230.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 128.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 66.2 million to 574.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 508.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher oil and natural gas production, partially offset by lower oil and natural gas prices, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 361.2 million to 1.66 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.30 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to higher oil and natural gas production and higher realized oil prices, partially offset by lower natural gas prices, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 From time to time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations.

 General Outlook and Trends 
 Our business success and financial results are dependent on many factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments, as well as competition from other sources of energy. For example, the results of the 2024 presidential election and any potential political uncertainty in the United States may alter our current regulatory framework and impact our business and the oil and gas industry generally. Commodity price volatility, in particular, is a significant risk to our business, cash flows and results of operations. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, ongoing military conflicts, political instability, particularly in China or the Middle East, the actions of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and certain other oil-exporting countries OPEC+ ), weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, oil and natural gas price differentials and other factors. 
 The prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs heavily influence our revenues, profitability, cash flow available for capital expenditures, the repayment of debt and the payment of cash dividends, if any, access to capital, borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement and future rate of growth. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Declines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices not only reduce our revenues, but could also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we can produce economically and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves and our ability to comply with the financial covenants under our Credit Agreement. See Risk Factors Risks Related to our Financial Condition Our success is dependent on the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Low oil, natural gas and NGL prices and the continued volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations in the Annual Report. 
 Oil prices were lower in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, oil prices averaged 75.27 per Bbl, ranging from a high of 83.88 per Bbl in early July to a low of 65.75 per Bbl in mid-September, based upon the West Texas Intermediate WTI oil futures contract price for the earliest delivery date. Oil prices averaged 82.22 per Bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We realized a weighted average oil price of 75.67 per Bbl (with no realized gains or losses from oil derivatives) for our oil production for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 82.49 per Bbl (with no realized gains or losses from oil derivatives) for our oil production for the three months ended September 30, 2023. At October 22, 2024, the WTI oil futures contract for the earliest delivery date had decreased from the average price for the third quarter of 2024 of 75.27 per Bbl, settling at 72.09 per Bbl, which was a decrease as compared to 88.75 per Bbl at October 20, 2023.

 Natural gas prices were lower in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, natural gas prices averaged 2.23 per MMBtu, ranging from a low of 1.90 per MMBtu in late August to a high of 2.92 per MMBtu in late September, based upon the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures contract price for the earliest delivery date. Natural gas prices averaged 2.66 per MMBtu for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We report production volumes in two streams, oil and natural gas (which includes both dry gas and NGLs). Waha prices were also lower for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, which contributed to lower realized weighted average natural gas prices for the third quarter of 2024. We realized a weighted average natural gas price of 1.83 per Mcf 1.94 per Mcf including realized gains from natural gas derivatives) for our natural gas production (including revenues attributable to NGLs) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.56 per Mcf 3.34 per Mcf including realized losses from natural gas derivatives) for our natural gas production (including revenues attributable to NGLs) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Certain volumes of our natural gas production are sold at prices established at the beginning of each month by the various markets where we sell our natural gas production, and certain volumes of our natural gas production are sold at daily market prices. At October 22, 2024, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures contract price for the earliest delivery date had increased from the average price for the third quarter of 2024 of 2.23 per MMBtu, to 2.31 per MMBtu, which was a decrease as compared to 2.90 per MMBtu at October 20, 2023. 
 The prices we receive for oil and natural gas production often reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as the WTI oil price or the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. At September 30, 2024, most of our oil production from the Delaware Basin was sold based on prices established in Midland, Texas, and a significant portion of our natural gas production from the Delaware Basin was sold based on Houston Ship Channel pricing, while the remainder of our Delaware Basin natural gas production was sold primarily based on prices established at the Waha hub in far West Texas. 
 The Midland-Cushing (Oklahoma) oil price differential has been highly volatile in recent years. At October 22, 2024, this oil price differential was positive at approximately + 0.60 per Bbl. At October 22, 2024, we had no derivative contracts in place to mitigate our exposure to this Midland-Cushing (Oklahoma) oil price differential for 2024. 
 Certain volumes of our Delaware Basin natural gas production are exposed to the Waha-Henry Hub basis differential, which has also been highly volatile in recent years. Concerns about natural gas pipeline takeaway capacity out of the Delaware Basin have increased, particularly beginning in the latter half of 2022. As a result, the Waha-Henry Hub basis differential began to widen. The Waha-Henry Hub basis differential averaged 2.35) per MMBtu for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Between September 30, 2024 and October 22, 2024, this natural gas price differential remained wide at approximately 2.30) per MMBtu. As a result of low natural gas prices or wide Waha basis differentials, from time to time we or our non-operated partners may elect to temporarily shut in or restrict a portion of our natural gas production. A significant portion of our Delaware Basin natural gas production, however, is sold at Houston Ship Channel pricing and is not exposed to Waha pricing. During 2022 and 2023, we typically realized a narrower differential to natural gas sold at the Waha hub despite higher transportation charges incurred to transport the natural gas to the Gulf Coast. At certain times, we may also sell a portion of our natural gas production into other markets to improve our realized natural gas pricing. Further, approximately 6 of our reported natural gas production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to the Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale plays, which are not exposed to Waha pricing. In addition, as a two-stream reporter, most of our natural gas volumes in the Delaware Basin are processed for NGLs, resulting in a further reduction in the reported natural gas volumes exposed to Waha pricing. 
 From time to time, we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Even so, decisions as to whether, at what price and what production volumes to hedge are difficult and depend on market conditions and our forecast of future production and oil, natural gas and NGL prices, and we may not always employ the optimal hedging strategy. This, in turn, may affect the liquidity that can be accessed through the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement and through the capital markets. During the first nine months of 2024, we realized a net gain on our natural gas basis differential derivative contracts of approximately 8.6 million, resulting primarily from natural gas basis differentials that were below the fixed prices of certain of our natural gas basis differential swap contracts. At October 22, 2024, we had derivative natural gas basis differential swap contracts in place to mitigate our exposure to the Waha-Henry Hub basis differential for approximately 2.8 Bcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the remainder of 2024 and 11.0 Bcf for 2025. 
 We have at times experienced pipeline-related interruptions to our oil, natural gas or NGL production or produced water disposal. In certain recent periods, shortages of NGL fractionation capacity were experienced by certain operators in the Delaware Basin. Although we did not encounter such fractionation capacity problems, we can provide no assurances that such problems will not arise. If we do experience any material interruptions with produced water disposal, takeaway capacity or NGL fractionation, our oil and natural gas revenues, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Should we experience future periods of negative pricing for natural gas, as we did during the second and

 third quarters of 2024, we may temporarily shut in certain high gas-oil ratio wells and take other actions to mitigate the impact on our realized natural gas prices and results. 
 We have at times experienced inflation in the costs of certain oilfield services, including diesel, steel, labor, trucking, sand, personnel and completion costs, among others. Should oil prices remain at their current levels or increase, we may be subject to additional service cost inflation in future periods, which may increase our costs to drill, complete, equip and operate wells. In addition, supply chain disruptions and other inflationary pressures experienced in recent periods throughout the United States and global economy and in the oil and natural gas industry may limit our ability to procure the necessary products and services we need for drilling, completing and producing wells in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in reduced margins and delays to our operations and could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our oil and natural gas exploration, development, production, midstream and related operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations can result in substantial monetary penalties or delay or suspension of operations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these laws, rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted and new laws, rules and regulations are proposed or promulgated, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are, or will become, subject. For more information about the Company s regulatory matters, see Business Regulation and Risk Factors Risks Related to Laws and Regulations in the Annual Report. 
 On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted a new set of rules that require a wide range of climate-related disclosures, including material climate-related risks, information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant s business, results of operations or financial condition, Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a phased-in basis by certain larger registrants when those emissions are material and the filing of an attestation report covering the same, and disclosure of the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, including costs and losses. Compliance dates under the final rule are phased in by registrant category. Multiple lawsuits have been filed challenging the SEC s new climate rules, which have been consolidated and will be heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying the final rules until judicial review is complete. 
 In accordance with the requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, on January 26, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA published its proposed rule regarding the waste emissions charge, applicable to excess methane emissions at certain oil and natural gas facilities. Further, on March 8, 2024, the EPA published its final rules imposing new, stricter requirements for methane monitoring, reporting and emissions control at certain oil and natural gas facilities. Finally, on April 10, 2024, the Bureau of Land Management published its final waste prevention rule, which requires operators of oil and gas leases to take reasonable steps to avoid natural gas waste or pay royalties on certain natural gas waste, as well as develop leak detection, repair, and waste minimization plans. 
 Like other oil and natural gas producing companies, our properties are subject to natural production declines. By their nature, our oil and natural gas wells will experience rapid initial production declines. We attempt to overcome these production declines by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves, by exploring for new sources of reserves and, at times, by acquisitions. During times of severe oil, natural gas and NGL price declines, however, drilling additional oil or natural gas wells may not be economic, and we may find it necessary to reduce capital expenditures and curtail drilling operations in order to preserve liquidity. A significant reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities could materially impact our production volumes, revenues, reserves, cash flows and the availability under our Credit Agreement. See Risk Factors Risks Related to our Financial Condition Our exploration, development, exploitation and midstream projects require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed our cash flows from operations and potential borrowings, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms, which could adversely affect our future growth in the Annual Report. 
 We strive to focus our efforts on increasing oil and natural gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our ability to find and develop sufficient quantities of oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success. Future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the costs of acquiring, drilling and completing our prospects. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the sources and effects of our market risk since December 31, 2023, which are disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of the Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference. 
 Commodity price exposure. We are exposed to market risk as the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate as a result of changes in supply and demand and other factors. To partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations, we have entered into derivative financial instruments in the past and expect to enter into derivative financial instruments in the future to cover a significant portion of our anticipated future production.

 We typically use costless (or zero-cost) collars, three-way collars and/or swap contracts to manage risks related to changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Costless collars provide us with downside price protection through the purchase of a put option that is financed through the sale of a call option. Because the call option proceeds are used to offset the cost of the put option, these arrangements are initially costless to us. Three-way costless collars also provide us with downside price protection through the purchase of a put option, but they also allow us to participate in price upside through the purchase of a call option. The purchase of both the put option and call option are financed through the sale of a call option. Because the proceeds from the call option sale are used to offset the cost of the purchased put and call options, these arrangements are also initially costless to us. In the case of a costless collar, the put option or options and the call option or options have different fixed price components. When the settlement price is below the price floor established by the collar, we receive from our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the price floor multiplied by the contract oil, natural gas or NGL volume. When the settlement price is above the price ceiling established by the costless collar, we pay our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the price ceiling multiplied by the contract oil, natural gas or NGL volume. In a swap contract, a floating price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period, providing downside price protection. 
 We record all derivative financial instruments at fair value. The fair value of our derivative financial instruments is determined using purchase and sale information available for similarly traded securities. At September 30, 2024, Bank of America, PNC Bank, Truist Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada, Comerica Bank and BOKF (or affiliates thereof) were the counterparties for our derivative instruments. We have considered the credit standing of the counterparty in determining the fair value of our derivative financial instruments. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had various costless collar contracts open and in place to mitigate our exposure to oil price volatility, each with an established price floor and ceiling. At September 30, 2024, we had natural gas basis differential swap contracts open and in place to mitigate our exposure to natural gas price volatility, with a specific term (calculation period), notional quantity (volume hedged) and fixed price.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in the reports it files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting.
