or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, 
 intend, could, should, would, may, seek, plan, 
 might, will, expect, predict, project, forecast, potential, 
 continue and negatives thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made,
are based on various underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement
to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We cannot
predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results or
conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any responsibility for
the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements represent our
intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors.
Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied
by those forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, without
limitation, those specifically addressed under the headings Risks Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K and its amendment filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC OR Commission in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in this Report, and information contained in other reports that we file with the SEC. In light
of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to
a different extent or at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this Report. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other
matters addressed in this Report and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Report. 

There are important factors that could cause actual

On June 30, 2019, BriVision entered into a Stock
Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with BioFirst Corporation. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued
 shares (post-split) of the Company s common stock to BioFirst in consideration for owed by the Company to BioFirst

On November 4, 2020, the Company executed an amendment
to the BioFirst Agreement with BioFirst to add ABV-2001 Intraocular Irrigation Solution and ABV-2002 Corneal Storage Solution to the agreement.
ABV-2002 is utilized during a corneal transplant procedure to replace a damaged or diseased cornea while ABV-2001 has broader utilization
during a variety of ocular procedures. 

Initially the Company will focus on ABV-2002,
a solution utilized to store a donor cornea prior to either penetrating keratoplasty (full thickness cornea transplant) or endothelial
keratoplasty (back layer cornea transplant). ABV-2002 is a solution comprised of a specific poly amino acid that protects ocular tissue
from damage caused by external osmolarity exposure during pre-surgery storage. The specific polymer in ABV-2002 can adjust osmolarity
to maintain a range of 330 to 390 mOsM thereby permitting hydration within the corneal stroma during the storage period. Stromal hydration
results in (a) maintaining acceptable corneal transparency and (b) prevents donor cornea swelling. ABV-2002 also contains an abundant
phenolic phytochemical found in plant cell walls that provides antioxidant antibacterial properties and neuroprotection. 

Early testing by BioFirst indicates that ABV-2002
may be more effective for protecting the cornea and retina during long-term storage than other storage media available today and can be
manufactured at lower cost. Further clinical development was put on hold due to the lack of funding. 

BioFirst was incorporated on November 7, 2006,
focusing on the R D, manufacturing, and sales of innovative patented pharmaceutical products. The technology of BioFirst comes from
the global exclusive licensing agreements BioFirst maintains with domestic R D institutions. Currently, BioFirst s main research
and development product is the vitreous substitute (Vitargus ), licensed by the National Health Research Institutes. Vitargus
is the world s first bio-degradable vitreous substitute and offers a number of advantages over current vitreous substitutes by minimizing
medical complications and reducing the need for additional surgeries. 

BioFirst has started the construction of a GMP
factory in Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park, Taiwan, with the aim at building a production base to supply the global market, and promote
the construction of bio-degradable vitreous substitute manufacturing centers in Taiwan. Completion of this factory would allow ABVC to
manufacture Vitargus with world-class technology in a GMP certified pharmaceutical factory. BioFirst is targeting to complete the construction
in 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not earned any net licensing income or net sales profit earned by BioFirst under these collaborative
agreements.

Overview 

ABVC BioPharma Inc., which was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Nevada on February 6, 2002, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on development of new drugs
and medical devices, all of which are derived from plants. 

Medicines derived from plants have a long history
of relieving or preventing many diseases and, typically, have exhibited fewer side effects than drugs developed from animals or chemical
ingredients. Perhaps the most famous example is aspirin, which evolved from a compound found in the bark and leaves of the willow tree
and was later marketed by Bayer starting in 1899. Aspirin has very few serious side effects and has proven to be one of the most successful
drugs in medical history. Some 50 years later, scientists identified anticancer compounds in the rosy periwinkle, which Eli Lilly subsequently
produced for the treatment of leukemia and Hodgkins disease. Other well-known examples of successful botanical drugs include the cancer-fighting
Taxol, isolated from the Pacific yew tree. 

The Company develops its pipeline by carefully
tracking new medical discoveries or medical device technologies in research institutions in the Asia-Pacific region. Pre-clinical, disease
animal model and Phase I safety studies are examined closely by the Company s scientists and other specialists known to the Company
to identify drugs that it believes demonstrate efficacy and safety based on the Company s internal qualifications. Once a drug is
shown to be a good candidate for further development and ultimately commercialization, BriVision licenses the drug or medical device from
the original researchers and begins to introduce the drugs clinical plan to highly respected principal investigators in the United States,
Australia and Taiwan. In almost all cases, we have found that research institutions in each of those countries are eager to work with
the Company to move forward with Phase II clinical trials. 

30 

Institutions that have or are now conducting phase
II clinical trials in partnership with ABVC include: 

Drug: ABV-1504, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Phase II completed. NCE drug Principal Investigators: Charles DeBattista M.D. and Alan F. Schatzberg, MD, Stanford University Medical Center, Cheng-Ta Li, MD, Ph.D - Taipei Veterans General Hospital 

Drug: ABV-1505, Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Phase II Part 1 completed. Principal Investigators: Keith McBurnett, Ph.D. and Linda Pfiffner, Ph.D., University of California San Francisco (UCSF), School of Medicine. Phase II, Part 2 clinical study sites include UCSF and 5 locations in Taiwan.

Medical Device: ABV-1701, Vitargus in vitrectomy surgery, Phase II Study has been initiated in Australia and Thailand, Principal Investigator: Duangnate Rojanaporn, M.D., Ramathibodi Hospital; Thuss Sanguansak, M.D., Srinagarind Hospital of the two Thailand Sites and Professor/Dr. Matthew Simunovic, Sydney Eye Hospital; Dr. Elvis Ojaimi, East Melbourne Eye Group East Melbourne Retina. The Phase II study started in the 2nd quarter of 2023, and the company is working on improvements to the Vitargus Product through the new batch of investigational product. 

The following trials are expected to begin in
the fourth quarter of 2024: 

Drug: ABV-1519, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer treatment, Phase I/II Study in Taiwan, Principal Investigator: Dr. Yung-Hung Luo, M.D., Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) 

Drug: ABV-1703, Advanced Inoperable or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer, Phase II, Principal Investigator: Andrew E. Hendifar, MD - Cedars Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) 

Upon successful completion of a Phase II trial,
ABVC will seek a partner, typically a large pharmaceutical company, to complete a Phase III study and commercialize the drug or medical
device upon approval by the US FDA, Taiwan TFDA and other country regulatory authorities. 

Another part of the Company s business is
conducted by BioKey, a wholly-owned subsidiary, that is engaged in a wide range of services, including, API characterization, pre-formulation
studies, formulation development, analytical method development, stability studies, IND/NDA/ANDA/510K submissions, and manufacturing clinical
trial materials (phase I through phase III) and commercial manufacturing. 

On February 8, 2019, the Company, BioLite Holding,
Inc. BioLite ), BioKey, Inc. BioKey ), BioLite Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company Merger Sub 1 ), and BioKey Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub
2 (collectively referred to as the Parties completed the business combination pursuant to that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), dated January 31, 2018, pursuant to which the Company acquired BioLite and BioKey
via issuing shares of the Company s Common Stock to the shareholders of BioLite and BioKey. As a result, BioLite and BioKey became
two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company on February 8, 2019. The Company issued an aggregate of 104,558,777 shares of Common Stock
(prior to the reverse stock split in 2019 and 2023) to the shareholders of both BioLite and BioKey under a registration statement on Form
S-4 (file number 333-226285), which became effective by operation of law on or about February 5, 2019. 

31 

On July 25, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate
of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation authorizing a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of its common
stock (the 2023 Split ). The Company s stockholders previously approved the Reverse Stock Split at the Company s
Special Shareholder Meeting held on July 7, 2023. The Reverse Stock Split was effected to reduce the number of issued and outstanding
shares and to increase the per share trading value of the Company s common stock, although that outcome is not guaranteed. In turn,
the Company believes that the Reverse Stock Split will enable the Company to restore compliance with certain continued listing standards
of NASDAQ Capital Market. 

BioLite was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada on July 27, 2016, with 500,000,000 shares authorized, par value 0.0001. BioLite s key subsidiaries include BioLite
BVI, Inc. BioLite BVI ), which was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on September 13, 2016 and BioLite, Inc. BioLite
Taiwan ), a Taiwanese corporation that was founded in February 2006. BioLite Taiwan has been in the business of developing new drugs
for over ten years. 

BioLite and BioLite BVI are holding companies
and have not carried out substantive business operations of their own. 

In January 2017, BioLite, BioLite BVI, BioLite
Taiwan, and certain shareholders of BioLite Taiwan entered into a share purchase / exchange agreement (the BioLite Share Purchase
/ Exchange Agreement ). Pursuant to the BioLite Share Purchase / Exchange Agreement, the shareholder participants to the BioLite
Share Purchase / Exchange Agreement sold their equity in BioLite Taiwan and used the proceeds from such sales to purchase shares of Common
Stock of BioLite at the same price per share, resulting in share ownership in BioLite Common Stock equal to the number of shares they
had held in BioLite Taiwan Common Stock. Upon closing of the Share Purchase/ Exchange Agreement in August 2017, BioLite owned, via BioLite
BVI, approximately 73 of BioLite Taiwan. The other shareholders who did not enter this Share Purchase/ Exchange Agreement retained their
equity ownership in BioLite Taiwan. 

BioKey was incorporated on August 9, 2000 in the
State of California. It is engaged primarily in research and development, manufacturing, and distribution of generic drugs and nutraceuticals
with strategic partners. BioKey provides a wide range of services, including, API characterization, pre-formulation studies, formulation
development, analytical method development, stability studies, IND/NDA/ANDA/510K submissions, and manufacturing clinical trial materials
(phase 1 through phase 3) and commercial manufacturing. It also licenses out its technologies and initiates joint research and development
processes with other biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical companies. 

The Vitargus Phase II study was put on hold due to Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) observed in patients with retinal detachment treated with either Vitargus or SF6 comparator after vitrectomy surgeries at the Thailand sites. By comparing the Thailand study with the First-in-Human (FIH) study completed in Australia in 2018, the SAEs derived from the patients in the Thailand study may be due to the modified in-situ hydrogel procedure which allows a longer surgical time window for the study. The Company is investigating the root causes of the events and is working towards developing a safe device in-situ procedure before reinstating the study.

NASDAQ Listing 

On May 24, 2023, we received a deficiency letter
from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying
the Company that it is not currently in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement, or the alternatives of market
value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(b)(1) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000, and the Company s stockholders 
equity was 1,734,507 as of March 31, 2023. In accordance with Nasdaq rules, the Company had 45 calendar days, or until July 10, 2023,
to submit a plan to regain compliance. After submitting a plan to regain compliance, on July 10, 2023, Nasdaq granted the Company an extension
until August 30, 20203, to comply with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). On July 31, 2023, the Company issued 300,000 shares of Common Stock and
200,000 pre-funded warrants, at an exercise price of 0.01 per share, in a registered direct offering. Pursuant to this transaction, the
stockholders equity was increased by 1.75M. On August 1, 2023, 500,000 of Notes were converted at 3.50 per share and the holder

the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lind, pursuant to which the Company issued Lind a secured, convertible note
in the principal amount of 3,704,167 (the Lind Offering ), for a purchase price of 3,175,000 (the Lind Note ),
that is convertible into shares of Common Stock at an initial conversion price of 1.05 per share, subject to adjustment. On August 24,
2023, the Company started repaying Lind the monthly installments due under the Lind Notes; 308,000 was repaid via the issuance of 176,678
shares of Common Stock (the Monthly Shares at the Redemption Share Price (as defined in the Lind Note) of 1.698 per share.
Pursuant to the terms of the Lind Note, Lind increased the amount of the next monthly payment to one million dollars, such that as of
September and together with the Monthly Shares, the Company repaid Lind a total of 1 million by September 2023. As a result, the stockholders 
equity increased by an additional 1 million. As a result of the four transactions referenced above, the Company estimated that
its stockholders equity would increase by approximately 10.65 million. On September 6, 2023, Nasdaq issued a letter that the Company
is in compliance with Rule 5550(b)(1), but noted that if at the time of the Company s next periodic report the Company does not
evidence compliance, it may be subject to delisting. 

On July 10, 2024, we received a notification letter
from the Nasdaq notifying the Company that the minimum bid price per share for its common shares has been below 1.00 for a period of
30 consecutive business days and the Company therefore no longer meets the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s common stock on Nasdaq. Under
the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has until January 6, 2025, to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing
bid price of the Company s common shares is at least 1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company
written confirmation of compliance. If the Company does not regain compliance during such 180-day period, the Company may be eligible
for an additional 180 calendar days, provided that the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held
shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq except for Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), and provide a written notice of its
intention to cure this deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.

shares issued and outstanding (the Ordinary Shares ). Immediately prior to the execution of the Agreement, Lucidaim
owned 1,501 ordinary shares and the Company owned 1,548 ordinary shares. The Shareholders entered into the joint venture to formally reduce

and development of drugs, medical device and digital media, investment, fund raising and consulting, distribution and marketing of supplements

As per the Agreement, the Shareholders shall supervise
and manage the business and operations of Biolite JP. The directors shall not be entitled to any renumeration for their services as a
director and each Shareholder can remove and replace the director he/she/it appointed. If a Shareholder sells or disposes of all of its
Ordinary Shares, the Shareholder-appointed director must tender his/her resignation. The Agreement also sets forth certain corporate actions
that must be pre-approved by all Shareholders (the Reserved Matters ). If the Shareholders are unable to make a decision
on any Reserved Matter, then either Shareholder can submit a deadlock notice to the other shareholder, 5 days after which they must refer
the matter to each Shareholder s chairman and use good faith to resolve the dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 10 days
thereafter, then either Shareholder can offer to buy all of the other Shareholder s Ordinary Shares for cash at a specified price;
if there is not affirmative acceptance of the sale, the sale shall proceed as set forth in the sale offer. 

Each of the Shareholders maintains a pre-emptive
right to purchase such number of additional Ordinary Shares as would allow such Shareholder to maintain its ownership percentage in Biolite
JP if Biolite JP issues any new Ordinary Shares. However, the Agreement provides that the Company shall lose its pre-emptive rights under
certain conditions. The Shareholders also maintain a right of first refusal if the other Shareholder receives an offer to buy such shareholder s
Ordinary Shares. 

The Agreement also requires Biolite JP to obtain a bank facility in
the amount of JPY 30,460,000 (approximately 272,000), for its initial working capital purposes. Pursuant to the Agreement, each Shareholder
agrees to guarantee such bank facility if the bank requires a guarantee. Accordingly, the Company may be liable for the bank facility
in an amount up to JPY 14,925,400 (approximately 134,000), which represents 49 of the maximum bank facility. The Agreement further provides
that Biolite JP shall issue annual dividends at the rate of at least 1.5 of Biolite JP s profits, if it has sufficient cash to
do so. 

36 

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company and Biolite
JP agree to use their best efforts to execute the License Agreement by the end of December 2021. The Company agreed that any negotiation
on behalf of Biolite JP regarding the terms of the License Agreement shall be handled by the directors appointed by Lucidaim. If the Company
and such Lucidaim directors do not reach agreement on the terms, Biolite JP may at its sole discretion determine not to execute the License
Agreement without any liability to the Company. 

The Agreement contains non-solicitation and non-compete
clauses for a period of 2 years after a Shareholder or its subsidiaries ceases to be a Shareholder, with such restrictive covenants limited
to business within the ophthalmologic filed or central neurological field. Any rights to intellectual property that arise from Biolite

This was a related party transaction and
was conducted at arm s length. In addition to the Company s board of directors providing approval for the Company to enter
into the Agreement, the Company s audit committee approved the Company s entry into the Agreement. The Board believes that
this joint venture will enhance the Company s ability to provide therapeutic solutions to significant unmet medical needs and to
develop innovative botanical drugs to treat central nervous system CNS and oncology/ hematology diseases. The Company s
Board of Directors believes that the joint venture has the potential to provide the Company with access to additional early-stage product
candidates that it would not otherwise have access to and to introduce the Company to early-stage opportunities, and therefore the Board
believes the joint venture is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. 

Recent Research Results 

Vitargus Phase II Study has been initiated
in Australia and Thailand, Principal Investigator: Duangnate Rojanaporn, M.D., Ramathibodi Hospital; Thuss Sanguansak, M.D., Srinagarind
Hospital of the two Thailand sites and Professor/Dr. Matthew Simunovic, Sydney Eye Hospital; Dr. Elvis Ojaimi, East Melbourne Eye Group 
East Melbourne Retina of the two Australian sites. The Phase II study has started in the 2 nd quarter of 2023. The company is
working on improvements to the Vitargus product through the new batch of investigational product. 

Initially the Company will focus on ABV-2002,
a solution utilized to store a donor cornea prior to either penetrating keratoplasty (full thickness cornea transplant) or endothelial
keratoplasty (back layer cornea transplant). Designated ABV-2002 under the Company s product identification system, the solution
is comprised of a specific poly amino acid that protects ocular tissue from damage caused by external osmolarity exposure during pre-surgery
storage. The specific polymer in ABV-2002 can adjust osmolarity to maintain a range of 330 to 390 mOsM thereby permitting hydration within
the corneal stroma during the storage period. Stromal hydration results in (a) maintaining acceptable corneal transparency and (b) prevents
donor cornea swelling. ABV-2002 also contains an abundant phenolic phytochemical found in plant cell walls that provides antioxidant antibacterial
properties and neuroprotection. 

Early testing by BioFirst indicates that ABV-2002
may be more effective for protecting the cornea and retina during long-term storage than other storage media available today and can be
manufactured at lower cost. Further clinical development task was put on hold due to the lack of funding. 

37 

In addition, BioFirst was incorporated on November
7, 2006, focusing on the R D, manufacturing, and sales of innovative patented pharmaceutical products. The technology of BioFirst
comes from the global exclusive licensing agreements BioFirst maintains with domestic R D institutions. Currently, BioFirst s
main research and development product is the vitreous substitute (Vitargus ), licensed by the National Health Research Institutes.
Vitargus is the world s first bio-degradable vitreous substitute and offers a number of advantages over current vitreous substitutes
by minimizing medical complications and reducing the need for additional surgeries. 

Vitargus has started the construction of a GMP
factory in Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park, Taiwan, with the aim at building a production base to supply the global market, and promote
the construction of bio-degradable vitreous substitute manufacturing centers in Taiwan. Completion of this factory would allow ABVC to
manufacture Vitargus with world-class technology in a GMP certified pharmaceutical factory. BioFirst is targeting to complete the construction
in 2025. 

On July 12, 2022, the Company announced the enrollment
progress in the Phase II Part II clinical study of the company s ADHD medicine (ABV-1505). Since the first-treated subject reported
on May 10, 2022, a total of sixty-nine (69) subjects have been enrolled in the study, including 50 who have completed the 56-day treatment.
The study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study entitled A Phase II Tolerability and Efficacy Study of PDC-1421
Treatment in Adult Patients with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Part II, is expected to eventually involve approximately
100 patients. Five prestigious research hospitals in Taiwan and the research hospital at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
are participating in the study which is a continuation of the Phase II part 1 study of ABV-1505 completed successfully at UCSF and accepted
by the U.S. Food Drug Administration in October of 2020. The UCSF Medical Center Institutional Review Board has approved participation
in the Part II study, and the site initiation visit was conducted in March 2023.

As of June 30, 2024, this February 2023 Lind Note
was fully repaid. On February 23, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Lind Securities Purchase
Agreement with Lind Global Fund II, LP Lind ), pursuant to which the Company issued Lind a secured, convertible
note in the principal amount of 3,704,167 (the Lind Offering ), for a purchase price of 3,175,000 (the Lind Note ),
that is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at an initial conversion price of 10.5 per share, subject to adjustment
(the Note Shares ). The Company also issued Lind a common stock purchase warrant (the Lind Warrant to purchase
up to 529,1,67 shares (post-split) of the Company s common stock at an initial exercise price of 10.5 per share, subject to adjustment
(each, a Warrant Share, together with the Note, Note Shares and Warrants, the Lind Securities ). 

The Lind Note does not carry any interest. Beginning
with the date that is six months from the issuance date of the Lind Note and on each one (1) month anniversary thereafter, the Company
shall pay Lind an amount equal to 308,651, until the outstanding principal amount of the Lind Note has been paid in full prior to or
on the Maturity Date or, if earlier, upon acceleration, conversion or redemption of the Lind Note in accordance with the terms thereof
(the Monthly Payments ). At the Company s discretion, the Monthly Payments shall be made in (i) cash, (ii) shares of
the Company s common stock, or (iii) a combination of cash and Shares; if made in shares, the number of shares shall be determined
by dividing (x) the principal amount being paid in shares by (y) 90 of the average of the 5 lowest daily VWAPs during the 20 trading

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default (as
defined in the Lind Note), the Company must pay Lind an amount equal to 120 of the then outstanding principal amount of the Lind Note
(the Mandatory Default Amount ), in addition to any other remedies under the Note or the other Transaction Documents. The
Company and Lind entered into a letter agreement on September 12, 2023, pursuant to which the Mandatory Default Amount was reduced to
115 of the then outstanding principal amount of the Lind Note; pursuant to the letter agreement, Lind also agreed to waive any default
associated with the Company s market capitalization being below 12.5 million for 10 consecutive days through February 23, 2024,
but retained its right to convert its Note. In addition, if the Company is unable to increase its market capitalization and is unable
to obtain a further waiver or amendment to the Lind Note, then the Company could experience an event of default under the Lind Note, which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company cannot
make any assurances regarding the likelihood, certainty, or exact timing of the Company s ability to increase its market capitalization,

Strategy 

Key elements of our business strategy include: 

Advancing to the pivotal trial phase of ABV-1701 Vitargus for the treatments of Retinal Detachment or Vitreous Hemorrhage, which we expect to generate revenues in the future. 

Focusing on licensing ABV-1504 for the treatment of major depressive disorder, MDD, after the successful completion of its Phase II clinical trials. 

Completing Phase II, Part 2 clinical trial for ABV-1505 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD. 

Out licensing drug candidates and medical device candidates to major pharmaceutical companies for phase III and pivotal clinical trials, as applicable, and further marketing if approved by the FDA. 

We plan to augment our core research and development
capability and assets by conducting Phase I and II clinical trials for investigational new drugs and medical devices in the fields of
CNS, Hematology/Oncology and Ophthalmology. 

Our management team has extensive experiences
across a wide range of new drug and medical device development, and we have in-licensed new drug and medical device candidates from large
research institutes and universities in both the U.S. and Taiwan. Through an assertive product development approach, we expect that we
will build a substantial portfolio of Oncology/ Hematology, CNS and Ophthalmology products. We primarily focus on Phase I and II research
of new drug candidates and out license the post-Phase-II products to pharmaceutical companies; we do not expect to devote substantial
efforts and resources to building the disease-specific distribution channels.

Business Objectives 

The Company is operating its core business based
on collaborative activities that can generate current and future revenues through research, development and/or commercialization joint
venture agreements. The terms of these agreements typically include payment to the Company related to one or more of the following: 

nonrefundable upfront license fees, 

development and commercial milestones, 

partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs and 

royalties on net sales of licensed products. 

Each type of payments results in revenue except
for revenue from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues. To date, we have not received
any royalty revenues. Revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service
to the joint venture partner. 

As part of the accounting for these arrangements,
the Company applies judgment to determine whether the performance obligations are distinct and develop assumptions in determining the
stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation identified in the collaboration agreements. To determine the stand-alone
selling price, the Company relies on assumptions which may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for
R D personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. 

The Company had multiple deliverables under the
collaborative agreements, including deliverables relating to grants of technology licenses, regulatory and clinical development, and marketing
activities. Estimation of the performance periods of the Company s deliverables requires the use of management s judgment.
Significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance periods include, but are not limited to,
the Company s experience in conducting clinical development, regulatory and manufacturing activities. The Company reviews the estimated
duration of its performance periods under its collaborative agreements on an annual basis, and makes any appropriate adjustments on a
prospective basis. Future changes in estimates of the performance period under its collaborative agreements could impact the timing of
future revenue recognition. 

(i) Nonrefundable upfront payments 

If a license to the Company s intellectual
property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in an arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue
from the related nonrefundable upfront payments based on the relative standalone selling price prescribed to the license compared to the
total selling price of the arrangement. The revenue is recognized when the license is transferred to the collaboration partners and the
collaboration partners are able to use and benefit from the license. To date, the receipt of nonrefundable upfront fees was solely for
the compensation of past research efforts and contributions made by the Company before the collaborative agreements were entered into
and does not relate to any future obligations and commitments made between the Company and the collaboration partners in the collaborative
agreements. 

(ii) Milestone payments 

The Company is eligible to receive milestone payments
under the collaborative agreement with collaboration partners based on achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial
events. Management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments, and concluded that these events fall into
two categories: (a) events which involve the performance of the Company s obligations under the collaborative agreement with collaboration
partners, and (b) events which do not involve the performance of the Company s obligations under the collaborative agreement with
collaboration partners. 

The former category of milestone payments consists
of those triggered by development and regulatory activities in the territories specified in the collaborative agreements. Management concluded
that each of these payments constitute substantive milestone payments. This conclusion was based primarily on the facts that (i) each
triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by the Company of one or more
of its deliverables, (ii) achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional
payments becoming due to the Company, (iii) each of the milestone payments is nonrefundable, (iv) substantial effort is required to complete
each milestone, (v) the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone, (vi)
a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments, and (vii) the milestone
payments relate solely to past performance. Based on the foregoing, the Company recognizes any revenue from these milestone payments in
the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs. 

43 

(iii) Multiple Element Arrangements 

The Company evaluates multiple element arrangements
to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of
accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations
and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separate from other aspects
of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has
value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s),
delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially within its control. In assessing whether an
item under a collaboration has standalone value, the Company considers factors such as the research, manufacturing, and commercialization
capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. The Company also
considers whether its collaboration partners can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining
element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s), and whether there are other vendors that can
provide the undelivered element(s). 

The Company recognizes arrangement consideration
allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 606 are satisfied for that particular unit of
accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, the Company recognizes revenue from the
combined unit of accounting over the Company s contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered elements, which is
typically the term of the Company s research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively
measurable performance measures do not exist, then the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over
the period the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance in which the service
is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then the Company recognizes revenue
under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount
of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line method or proportional performance
method, as applicable, as of the period ending date. 

At the inception of an arrangement that includes
milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent
nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either the Company s
performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting
from its performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (3) the consideration is reasonable
relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical,
regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of effort and investment
required to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether
a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Milestones that are not considered substantive
are recognized as earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the remaining period of performance, assuming all other
revenue recognition criteria are met. 

(iv) Royalties and Profit-Sharing Payments 

Under the collaborative agreement with the collaboration
partners, the Company is entitled to receive royalties on sales of products, which is at certain percentage of the net sales. The Company
recognizes revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in ASC 606. Based on those criteria, the Company
considers these payments to be contingent revenues, and recognizes them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is
resolved. 

44 

Revenues Derived from Research and Development
Activities Services - Revenues related to research and development and regulatory activities are recognized when the related services
or activities are performed, in accordance with the contract terms. The Company typically has only one performance obligation at the inception
of a contract, which is to perform research and development services. The Company may also provide its customers with an option to request
that the Company provides additional goods or services in the future, such as active pharmaceutical ingredient, API, or IND/NDA/ANDA/510K
submissions. The Company evaluates whether these options are material rights at the inception of the contract. If the Company determines
an option is a material right, the Company will consider the option a separate performance obligation. 

If the Company is entitled to reimbursement from
its customers for specified research and development expenses, the Company accounts for the related services that it provides as separate
performance obligations if it determines that these services represent a material right. The Company also determines whether the reimbursement
of research and development expenses should be accounted for as revenues or an offset to research and development expenses in accordance
with provisions of gross or net revenue presentation. The Company recognizes the corresponding revenues or records the corresponding offset
to research and development expenses as it satisfies the related performance obligations. 

The Company then determines the transaction price
by reviewing the amount of consideration the Company is eligible to earn under the contracts, including any variable consideration. Under
the outstanding contracts, consideration typically includes fixed consideration and variable consideration in the form of potential milestone
payments. At the start of an agreement, the Company s transaction price usually consists of the payments made to or by the Company
based on the number of full-time equivalent researchers assigned to the project and the related research and development expenses incurred.
The Company does not typically include any payments that the Company may receive in the future in its initial transaction price because
the payments are not probable. The Company would reassess the total transaction price at each reporting period to determine if the Company
should include additional payments in the transaction price. 

The Company receives payments from its
customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Upfront payments and fees may be recorded as contract liabilities
upon receipt or when due, and may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future period until the Company fulfills its
obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the right of the Company to consideration is
unconditional. The Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract
inception is such that the period between payment by the customers and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the
customers will be one year or less. 

Examples of collaborative agreements the Company
has entered into are as follows: 

Collaborative agreements with BHK, a related
party 

(i)

(ii) 
 In December of 2015, BHK paid the initial cash payment of 1 million upon the execution of the BHK Agreement. The Company concluded that certain deliverables are considered separate units of accounting as the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and recognized this cash payment as collaboration revenue when all research, technical, and development data was delivered to BHK in 2015. The payment included compensation for past research efforts and contributions made by BioLite Taiwan before the BHK agreement was signed and does not relate to any future commitments made by BioLite Taiwan and BHK in the BHK Agreement. 

(iii) 
 In August 2016, the Company received the second milestone payment of 1 million, and recognized collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Co-Development agreement with Rgene Corporation,
a related party 

On May 26, 2017, BriVision entered into a co-development
agreement (the Co-Dev Agreement with Rgene Corporation (the Rgene ), a related party under common control

BioFirst is a related party to the Company because a controlling beneficiary shareholder of YuanGene Corporation and the Company is one
of the directors and Common Stock shareholders of BioFirst (See Note 10). 

Pursuant to the BioFirst Collaborative Agreement,
the Company will co-develop and commercialize the Product with BioFirst and pay BioFirst in a total amount of 3,000,000 in cash or stock
of the Company before September 30, 2018. The amount of 3,000,000 is in connection with the compensation for BioFirst s past research
efforts and contributions made by BioFirst before the BioFirst Collaborative Agreement was signed and it does not relate to any future
commitments made by BioFirst and BriVision in this BioFirst Collaborative Agreement. In addition, the Company is entitled to receive 50 
of the future net licensing income or net sales profit, if any, and any development cost shall be equally shared by both BriVision and
BioFirst. 

On September 25, 2017, BioFirst has delivered
all research, technical, data and development data to BriVision. The Company determined to fully expense the entire amount of 3,000,000
since currently the related licensing rights do not have alternative future uses. According to ASC 730-10-25-1, absent alternative future
uses the acquisition of product rights to be used in research and development activities must be charged to research and development expenses
immediately. Hence, the entire amount of 3,000,000 is fully expensed as research and development expense during the year ended December
31, 2017. 

On June 30, 2019, BriVision entered into a Stock
Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with BioFirst Corporation. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued
42,857 shares (post-split) of the Company s common stock to BioFirst in consideration for 3,000,000 owed by the Company to BioFirst
(the Total Payment in connection with a certain collaborative agreement between the Company and BioFirst dated July 24,
2017 (the Collaborative Agreement ). Pursuant to the Collaborative Agreement, BioFirst granted the Company the global licensing
right to co-develop BFC-1401 or ABV-1701 Vitreous Substitute for Vitrectomy for medical purposes in consideration for the Total Payment. 

On August 5, 2019, BriVision entered into a second
Stock Purchase Agreement Purchase Agreement 2 with BioFirst Corporation. Pursuant to Purchase Agreement 2, the Company
issued 41,470 shares (post-split) of the Company s common stock to BioFirst in consideration for 2,902,911 owed by the Company
to BioFirst in connection with a loan provided to BriVision from BioFirst. 

On November 4, 2020, the Company executed an amendment
to the BioFirst Agreement with BioFirst, to add ABV-2001 Intraocular Irrigation Solution and ABV-2002 Corneal Storage Solution to the
agreement. ABV-2002 is utilized during a corneal transplant procedure to replace a damaged or diseased cornea, while ABV-2001 has broader
utilization during a variety of ocular procedures. 

Initially, the Company will focus on ABV-2002,
a solution utilized to store a donor cornea prior to either penetrating keratoplasty (full thickness cornea transplant) or endothelial
keratoplasty (back layer cornea transplant). ABV-2002 is a solution comprised of a specific poly amino acid that is intended to protect
ocular tissue from damage caused by external osmolarity exposure during pre-surgery storage. The specific polymer in ABV-2002 can adjust
osmolarity to maintain a range of 330 to 390 mOsM, thereby permitting hydration within the corneal stroma during the storage period.
Stromal hydration typically results in (a) maintaining acceptable corneal transparency and (b) prevents donor cornea swelling. ABV-2002
also contains an abundant phenolic phytochemical found in plant cell walls that provides antioxidant antibacterial properties and neuroprotection. 

48 

Early testing by BioFirst indicates that ABV-2002
may be more effective for protecting the cornea and retina during long-term storage than other storage media available today and can be
manufactured at lower cost. Further clinical development was put on hold due to the lack of funding. 

In addition, BioFirst was incorporated on November
7, 2006, focusing on the R D, manufacturing, and sales of innovative patented pharmaceutical products. The technology of BioFirst
comes from the global exclusive licensing agreements BioFirst maintains with domestic R D institutions. Currently, BioFirst s
main research and development product is the vitreous substitute (Vitargus ), licensed by the National Health Research
Institutes. Vitargus is the world s first bio-degradable vitreous substitute and offers a number of advantages over current vitreous
substitutes by minimizing medical complications and reducing the need for additional surgeries. 

Vitargus has started the construction of a GMP
factory in Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park, Taiwan, with the aim at building a production base to supply the global market, and promote
the construction of bio-degradable vitreous substitute manufacturing centers in Taiwan. Completion of this factory would allow ABVC to
manufacture Vitargus with world-class technology in a GMP certified pharmaceutical factory. BioFirst is targeting to complete the construction
in 2024. 

Co-Development agreement with BioLite Japan
K.K. 

On October 6, 2021 (the Completion Date ),
the Company, Lucidaim Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation Lucidaim , together with the Company, the Shareholders ),
and BioLite Japan K.K., a Japanese corporation BioLite JP entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the Agreement ).
BioLite JP is a private limited company (a Japanese Kabushiki Kaisha incorporated on December 18, 2018 and at the date of the
Agreement has 10,000 ordinary shares authorized, with 3,049 ordinary shares issued and outstanding (the Ordinary Shares ).
Immediately prior to the execution of the Agreement, Lucidaim owned 1,501 ordinary shares and the Company owned the 1,548 ordinary shares.
The Shareholders entered into the joint venture to formally reduce to writing their desire to invest in and operate BioLite JP as a joint
venture. The business of the joint venture shall be the research and development of drugs, medical device and digital media, investment,
fund running and consulting, distribution and marketing of supplements carried on by BioLite JP and its subsidiaries in Japan, or any
other territory or businesses as may from time to time be agreed by an amendment to the Agreement. The closing of the transaction is conditioned
upon the approval and receipt of all necessary government approvals, which have been received. 

Pursuant to the Agreement and the related share
transfer agreement, the Company shall transfer 54 of its Ordinary Shares to Lucidaim for no consideration, such that following the transfer,
Lucidaim shall own 1,555 Ordinary Shares (51 and the Company shall own 1,494 Ordinary Shares (49 ). Also pursuant to the Agreement,
there shall be 3 directors of BioLite JP, consisting of 1 director appointed by the Company and 2 appointed by Lucidiam. The Company shall
appoint Eugene Jiang, the Company s current Chairman and Chief Business Officer and Lucidaim shall appoint Michihito Onishi; the
current director of BioLite JP, Toru Seo (who is also a director of BioLite Japan s other shareholder), is considered the second
Lucidaim director. The Agreement further provides that the Company and BioLite JP shall assign the research collaboration and license
agreement between them to BioLite JP or prepare the same (the License Agreement ). The aforementioned transactions
occurred on the Completion Date. 

As per the Agreement, the Shareholders shall
supervise and manage the business and operations of BioLite JP. The directors shall not be entitled to any renumeration for their services
as a director and each Shareholder can remove and replace the director he/she/it appointed. If a Shareholder sells or disposes of all

corporate actions that must be pre-approved by all Shareholders (the Reserved Matters ). If the Shareholders are
unable to make a decision on any Reserved Matter, then either Shareholder can submit a deadlock notice to the other shareholder, 5 days
after which they must refer the matter to each Shareholder s chairman and use good faith to resolve the dispute. If such dispute
is not resolved within 10 days thereafter, then either Shareholder can offer to buy all of the other Shareholder s Ordinary Shares
for cash at a specified price; if there is not affirmative acceptance of the sale, the sale shall proceed as set forth in the sale offer. 

49 

Each of the Shareholders maintains a pre-emptive
right to purchase such number of additional Ordinary Shares as would allow such Shareholder to maintain its ownership percentage in BioLite
JP if BioLite JP issues any new Ordinary Shares. However, the Agreement provides that the Company shall lose its pre-emptive rights under
certain conditions. The Shareholders also maintain a right of first refusal if the other Shareholder receives an offer to buy such shareholder s

in an amount up to JPY 14,925,400 (approximately 134,000), which represents 49 of the maximum bank facility. The Agreement further provides
that BioLite JP shall issue annual dividends at the rate of at least 1.5 of Biolite s profits, if it has sufficient cash to do
so. 

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company and BioLite
JP agree to use their best efforts to execute the License Agreement by the end of December 2021. The Company agreed that any negotiation
on behalf of BioLite JP regarding the terms of the License Agreement shall be handled by the directors appointed by Lucidaim. If the Company
and such Lucidaim directors do not reach agreement on the terms, Biolite may at its sole discretion determine not to execute the License
Agreement without any liability to the Company.

Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak 

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization
declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on March 10, 2020, declared it
to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus include restrictions on travel, and quarantines
in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. The coronavirus and actions taken to mitigate
it have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including
the geographical area in which the Company operates. While the closures and limitations on movement, domestically and internationally,
are expected to be temporary, if the outbreak continues on its current trajectory the duration of the supply chain disruption could reduce
the availability, or result in delays, of materials or supplies to and from the Company, which in turn could materially interrupt the
Company s business operations. Given the speed and frequency of the continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic,
the Company cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact to its consolidated results of operations. We have taken every precaution
possible to ensure the safety of our employees. 

The COVID-19 pandemic, including variants, has
adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, elements of our CDMO business sector. The COVID-19 pandemic government
imposed restrictions constrained researcher access to labs globally. These constraints limited scientific discovery capacity and we observed
that demand in those labs fell well below historic levels. As constraints on social distancing were gradually lifted around the world
recently, labs have been able to increase research activity. While we believe that underlying demand is still not yet at pre-COVID-19
levels since lab operations remain below their normal capacity, we are hopeful that the vaccination programs that are underway combined
with policy changes planned for the summer will further increase research activity and support a return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels
worldwide. 

The global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve
rapidly, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely, including its potential effect on our plans and timelines. 

Additionally, it is reasonably possible that estimates
made in the financial statements have been, or will be, materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions,
including losses on inventory; impairment losses related to goodwill and other long-lived assets and current obligations. 

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company has identified critical accounting
policies that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operation
involved could result in material changes to our financial position or results of operations under different conditions or using different
assumptions. 

The Company uses the same accounting policies
in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024 2023 Form 10-K. 

Estimates and Assumptions 

In preparing our consolidated financial statements,
we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments,
probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We are also subject
to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, Business
Combinations Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60) which requires certain joint ventures to apply a new basis of accounting
upon formation by recognizing and initially measuring most of their assets and liabilities at fair value. The guidance does not apply
to joint ventures that may be proportionately consolidated and those that are collaborative arrangements. ASU 2023-05 is effective for
joint venture with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact that the standard will have on its unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Going Concern and
Liquidity Consideration 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net loss of 5,387,980. As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s working capital deficit was 4,167,315. In addition, the Company had net cash outflows of 1,315,534
from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These conditions give rise to substantial doubt as to whether
the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Management s plan is to continue to improve operations to generate positive
cash flows by 1) ensuring our cash consideration from our licensing agreements be fully collected soon, 2) raising additional capital
through private or public offerings, 3) strictly controlling cash operating expenses, and 4) reducing debts and interest expense. 

Notably,
the Company has generated cash inflow and reduced a substantial amount of debts during the first nine months ended September 30, 2024,
from 2.2 million to 1.6 million. We also reduced our outstanding warrants from 2.5 million shares to 2 million shares in October, receiving
around 210,000 in cash. If the Company is not able to generate positive operating cash flows, and raise additional capital, there is
the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its short-term obligations. Management is committed to enhancing operations to generate
positive cash flows to meet our operation needs. 

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net cash
used in operating activities were 1,315,534 and 3,756,385, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in licensing
cash payment from ForSeeCon and OncoX, and the decrease in operating expenses. Company has been strictly controlling the operating cash outflow,
such as making certain payments with shares in lieu of cash, extending vendors payment terms, and other initiatives to save the
cash burn. 

Cash Flow from Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, the net cash used in investing activities were 0 and 514,359 respectively. The increases were mainly due to the increase in
prepayment for long-term investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, the net cash provided by financing activities were 1,399,313 and 3,831,540, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided
by financing activities were primarily due to the proceeds from issuance of convertible notes, Lind s exercise of warrants, and
common stock subscription in advance.
