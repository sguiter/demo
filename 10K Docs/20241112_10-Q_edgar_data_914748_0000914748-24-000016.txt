 The aggregate fair value and gross unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities - available for sale in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 were billion and million, respectively. The fair value of securities for the single issuer (the U.S. government), whose securities comprised the largest unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024, did not exceed of the overall fair value of the Company s fixed maturity securities - available for sale. The fair value of the securities for the issuer with the second largest unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 comprised less than of the Company s fixed maturity securities - available for sale. In addition, as indicated on the above table, there was no significant concentration of unrealized losses in any one market sector. The million of unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities - available for sale that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than one year were generally comprised of agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Of these unrealized losses, million were related to securities that were rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. The million of unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities - available for sale in an unrealized loss position for more than one year related primarily to agency residential mortgage-backed securities, as well as domestic and foreign corporate securities. Of these unrealized losses, million were related to securities that were rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. In all instances, there were no projected cash flow shortfalls to recover the full book value of the investments and the related interest obligations. The mortgage-backed securities still have excess credit coverage and are current on interest and principal payments. Based upon the Company s current evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and non-issuer-specific credit spreads and are not credit-related. In addition, the contractual terms of these securities do not permit these securities to be settled at a price less than their amortized cost.

 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) 
 The Company records results from limited partnership investments on the equity method of accounting with changes in value reported through net investment income. The net investment income from limited partnerships is dependent upon the Company s share of the net asset values NAVs of interests underlying each limited partnership. Due to the timing of receiving financial information from these partnerships, the results are generally reported on a one-month or quarter lag. If the Company determines there has been a significant decline in value of a limited partnership during this lag period, a loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline. 
 The Company had contractual commitments to invest up to an additional billion in limited partnerships and private placement loans at September 30, 2024. These commitments will be funded when called in accordance with the partnership and loan agreements, which have investment periods that expire, unless extended, through 2034. 
 In 2022, the Company entered into corporate-owned life insurance COLI policies, which are invested in debt and equity securities. The COLI policies are carried within other invested assets at the policy cash surrender value of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Other invested assets, at fair value, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were comprised of preferred shares held in Everest Preferred International Holdings, Ltd. Preferred Holdings ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Group. See Note 13 of the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 The Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs, primarily as an investor through normal investment activities, but also as an investment manager. A VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company s assessment, if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company s consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did hold any interests for which it is the primary beneficiary. 
 11 

billion and billion, respectively, which are included in general and limited partnerships, COLI policies and other alternative investments in other invested assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Exposure relating specifically to general and limited partnerships as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is limited to the total carrying value of billion and billion. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling million whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management. 
 In addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in asset-backed securities, which includes collateralized loan obligations, and are classified as fixed maturities - available for sale. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits and the Company s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company s investment.) ) ) ) Net realized gains (losses) from dispositions ) ) ) ) Equity securities, fair value Net realized gains (losses) from dispositions Gains (losses) from fair value adjustments ) ) ) Other invested assets Other invested assets, fair value Gains (losses) from fair value adjustments ) ) Total net gains (losses) on investments ) )

 Financial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Reported, at Fair Value 
 Certain financial instruments disclosed, but not reported, at fair value are excluded from the fair value hierarchy tables above. Fair values of fixed maturity securities - held to maturity, senior notes and long-term subordinated notes can be found within Notes 3, 7 and 8 of the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.

 Our operating segments each have executive leaders who are responsible for the overall performance of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker CODM ), the Chief Executive Officer of Everest Group, Ltd., who is ultimately responsible for reviewing the business to assess performance, make operating decisions and allocate resources. We report the results of our operations consistent with the manner in which our CODM reviews the business.

These products have been realigned from within the Reinsurance segment to the Insurance segment to appropriately reflect how the business segments are managed. These changes have been reflected retrospectively. 
 The Company does not review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance sheet data. Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon

Revenues. 
 Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 1.4 to 2.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 93 million, or 10.3 , decrease in our insurance business, partially offset by a 54 million, or 2.7 , increase in our reinsurance business. The increase in reinsurance premiums was primarily due to increases in the property pro rata and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business. The decrease in insurance premiums was primarily due to portfolio actions taken within accident and health, workers compensation and specialty casualty lines of business, partially offset by an increase in property/short tail business and specialty business. Gross written premiums increased by 5.2 to 8.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 607 million, or 11.3 , increase in our reinsurance business, partially offset by a 176 million, or 6.0 , decrease in our insurance business. The increase in reinsurance premiums was primarily driven by increases in the property and casualty pro rata lines of business and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business. The decrease in insurance premiums reflects the impact of portfolio actions taken primarily within the accident and health and workers compensation lines of business, partially offset by increases in the property/short tail and specialty lines of business. 
 Net written premiums decreased by 4.3 to 2.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in premiums ceded to Mt. Logan Re, Ltd. Mt. Logan Re cells within the Reinsurance segment for property catastrophe excess of loss line of business, and an increase in premium cession in the Insurance segment driven by business mix and lower retention in certain lines of business. Net written premiums increased by 2.7 to 7.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current year over prior year increase remained relatively consistent with the percentage increase in gross written premiums. 
 Premiums earned increased by 9.4 to 2.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned increased by 7.0 to 6.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire. The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is primarily the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period, whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. 
 Other Income (Expense). We recorded other expense of 13 million and other income of 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes were primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We recorded other income of 12 million and other expense of 12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized foreign currency exchange income of 4 million and foreign currency exchange expense of 19 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, the other income incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a 9 million pension plan curtailment gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024.

Incurred losses and LAE increased by 11.2 to 1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 119 million in current year catastrophe losses and an increase of 89 million in current year attritional losses. The increase in current year attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in underlying exposures, due to increased premiums earned. The current year catastrophe losses of 246 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 73 million), Hurricane Beryl 66 million), Hurricane Debby 60 million) and the 2024 third quarter Calgary Alberta storms 35 million).

Prior year incurred favorable development of 11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a reduction in prior year catastrophe reserves. 
 
 Incurred losses and LAE increased by 5.4 to 4.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 182 million in current year attritional losses and an increase of 107 million in current year catastrophe losses. The increase in current year

attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in underlying exposures, due to increased premiums earned. The current year catastrophe losses of 355 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 73 million), Hurricane Beryl 66 million), Hurricane Debby 60 million), the 2024 Brazil Floods 35 million), the third quarter 2024, Calgary Alberta storms 35 million), the 2024 Taiwan earthquake 23 million), the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse 23 million) and the 2024 Dubai floods 20 million). The current year catastrophe losses of 249 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to the 2023 Turkey earthquakes 84 million), the 2023 New Zealand storms 42 million), the 2023 Morocco earthquake 40 million), Hurricane Idalia 40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 28 million), the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 20 million), Typhoon Mawar 11 million) and the 2023 second quarter U.S. storms 4 million), partially offset by 20 million of reinsurance recoverables related to Hurricane Ian. Prior year incurred favorable development of 32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a reduction in prior year catastrophe reserves. 
 
 Commission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased to 498 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 454 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased to 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and changes in the mix of business. Refer to the Ratios section for commission and brokerage ratio analysis discussion. 
 Other Underwriting Expenses. Other underwriting expenses increased to 157 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 149 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other underwriting expenses increased to 449 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 424 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in other underwriting expenses remained relatively consistent with the growth in premiums earned. Refer to the Ratios section for other underwriting expense ratio analysis discussion. 
 Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses, which are general operating expenses that are not allocated to segments, have decreased to 6 million from 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and decreased slightly to 17 million from 18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in Corporate expenses for the three-and nine-months periods in September 30, 2024 are primarily due to a greater percentage of general expenses being allocated to operating segments, partially offset by increases in information management related costs and staff-related compensation expenses. 
 Interest, Fees and Bond Issue Cost Amortization Expense. Interest, fees and other bond amortization expense was 38 million and 34 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest, fees and other bond amortization expense was 112 million and 99 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases were mainly due to higher interest costs on the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY borrowing as a result of the rising interest rate environment. Interest expense was also impacted by the movements in the floating interest rate related to the Company s outstanding fixed to floating rate long-term subordinated notes, which is reset quarterly, per the note agreement. The floating rate was 7.76 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 8.01 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). We had income tax expense of 67 million and 25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had income tax expense of 266 million and 154 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense is primarily a function of the geographic location of the Company s pre-tax income and the statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate ETR is primarily affected by tax-exempt investment income, foreign tax credits and dividends. Variations in the ETR generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income, including the impact of catastrophe losses, foreign exchange gains (losses) and net gains (losses) on investments, among jurisdictions with different tax rates. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which is the corporate alternative minimum tax, and do not expect the legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Net Income (Loss). 
 Our net income was 279 million and 222 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net income was 1.1 billion and 771 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes were primarily driven by the financial component fluctuations explained above.

Ratios. 
 Our combined ratio increased by 1.0 points to 97.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 96.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 0.7 points to 92.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 93.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the analysis of combined ratio components below. 
 The loss ratio component increased by 1.2 points to 69.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 68.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to an increase of 119 million in current year catastrophe losses. The loss ratio component decreased by 1.0 points to 65.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to favorable development on prior year attritional losses compared to unfavorable development in 2023. 
 The commission and brokerage ratio components increased to 21.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased to 21.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These changes were mainly due to changes in the mix of business. 
 The other underwriting expense ratios decreased to 6.7 from 7.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and decreased to 6.6 from 6.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases for the three-and nine-months months comparative periods were mainly due to a higher earned premium base. 
 
 Stockholder s Equity. 
 Stockholder s equity increased by 1.4 billion to 8.6 billion at September 30, 2024 from 7.2 billion at December 31, 2023, principally as a result of 1.1 billion of net income and 24 million of benefit plan net gain, 252 million increase in net unrealized appreciation on fixed income available for sale securities, net of tax, and 14 million of net foreign currency translation gains. The movement in the unrealized appreciation on investments was driven by the change in interest rates on the Company s fixed maturity - available for sale portfolio. 
 
 Consolidated Investment Results 
 
 Net Investment Income. 
 Net investment income increased to 316 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 278 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase of 44 million in income from fixed maturity securities, a decrease of 35 million from limited partnership income, an increase of 21 million in income from other alternative investments and an increase of 5 million from short term investments, mainly due to the rising interest rate environment. Net investment income increased by 37.2 to 976 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 711 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase of 170 million in income from fixed maturity securities, an increase of 34 million from limited partnership income, an increase of 43 million in income from other alternative investments and an increase of 21 million from short-term investments. The changes in limited partnership income primarily reflect changes in reported net asset values. As such, until these asset values are monetized and the resultant income is distributed, they are subject to volatile future increases or decreases in the asset value.

Net Gains (Losses) on Investments. 
 The following table presents the composition of our net gains (losses) on investments for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance Realized gains (losses) from dispositions: Fixed maturity securities - available for sale Gains 2 1 1 15 4 10 Losses (4) (13) 9 (37) (25) (12) Total (2) (12) 10 (23) (21) (2) Equity securities Gains 2 (2) 2 8 (7) Losses Total 1 (1) 1 8 (7) Other Invested Assets Gains 1 1 Losses Total 1 1 Short-Term Investments Gains 1 Losses Total Total net realized gains (losses) from dispositions Gains 2 2 17 13 3 Losses (4) (13) 9 (38) (26) (12) Total (2) (11) 9 (21) (12) (9) Allowance for credit losses (9) (1) (7) (3) (12) 8 Gains (losses) from fair value adjustments Equity securities 1 (13) 14 (2) (2) Other invested assets 47 (34) 81 28 (32) 60 Total 49 (47) 95 26 (34) 60 Total net gains (losses) on investments 39 (59) 98 1 (59) 60 
 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) 
 Total net gains (losses) on investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consist of net gains from fair value adjustments of 49 million, partially offset by an increase to the allowance for credit losses to 9 million and 2 million of net realized losses from disposition of investments. 
 Total net gains (losses) on investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to net gains from fair value adjustments of 26 million, offset by and 21 million of net realized losses from disposition of investments and a decrease to 3 million for the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Segment Results. 
 The Company operates through two operating segments: Reinsurance and Insurance. The Reinsurance segment writes worldwide property and casualty reinsurance and specialty lines of business, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies. Business is written in the United States as well as through branches in Canada and Singapore. The Insurance segment writes property and casualty insurance directly and 
 34 

through brokers, including for surplus lines, and general agents within the United States. The two segments are managed independently, but conform with corporate guidelines with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations. 
 Our two operating segments each have executive leaders who are responsible for the overall performance of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker CODM ), the Chief Executive Officer of Everest Group, Ltd., who is ultimately responsible for reviewing the business to assess performance, make operating decisions and allocate resources. We report the results of our operations consistent with the manner in which our CODM reviews the business. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised the classification and presentation of certain products related to its accident and health business within the segment groupings. These products have been realigned from within the Reinsurance segment to the Insurance segment to appropriately reflect how the business segments are managed. These changes have been reflected retrospectively. 
 The Company does not review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance sheet data. Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of the two operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. The Company measures its underwriting results using ratios, in particular, loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned. Management has determined that these measures are appropriate and align with how the business is managed. We continue to evaluate our segments as our business evolves and may further refine our segments and financial performance measures. 
 Our loss and LAE reserves are management s best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including all prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, recently reported loss claim experience and trends related to prior periods. Such re-evaluations are recorded in incurred losses in the period in which the re-evaluation is made. Management s best estimate is developed through collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each segment reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims and segment senior management and has the responsibility for recommending and approving management s best estimate. Reserves are further reviewed by Group s Chief Reserving Actuary and senior management. The objective of such process is to determine a single best estimate viewed by management to be the best estimate of its ultimate loss liability. 
 The following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods indicated.

 Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 2.7 to 2.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by property pro rata and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business. Gross written premiums increased by 11.3 to 6.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by property and casualty pro rata lines of business and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business. 
 Net written premiums of 1.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained consistent with the 1.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, with the minimal decrease due to increased cessions to Mt. Logan Re cells emanating from the property catastrophe line of business. Net written premiums increased by 10.0 to 5.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was consistent with the percentage increase in gross written premiums. 
 Premiums earned increased by 17.6 to 1.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned increased by 13.7 to 4.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire.

 Incurred losses increased by 16.7 to 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 998 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 105 million in current year attritional losses and an increase of 105 million in current year catastrophe losses, partially offset by an increase in favorable prior year loss development of 43 million. The increase in current year attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in underlying exposures, due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned. The current year catastrophe losses of 222 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Debby 60 million), Hurricane Helene 57 million), Hurricane Beryl 56 million) and the 2024 third quarter Calgary Alberta storms 35 million). The 117 million of current year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to the 2023 Morocco earthquake 40 million), Hurricane Idalia 40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 23 million), and the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 15 million). 
 
 Incurred losses increased by 9.5 to 3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 247 million in current year attritional losses and an increase of 82 million in current year catastrophe losses. The increase in current year attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in underlying exposures, due to the increase in premiums earned. The current year catastrophe losses of 319 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related 
 37 

primarily to Hurricane Helene 57 million), Hurricane Beryl 56 million), Hurricane Debby 59 million), the 2024 Brazil Floods 35 million), the 2024 third quarter Calgary Alberta storms 35 million), the 2024 Dubai floods 20 million), the 2024 Taiwan earthquake 23 million) and the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse 23 million). The 237 million of current year catastrophe losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to the 2023 Turkey earthquakes 84 million), the 2023 New Zealand storms 41 million), the 2023 Morocco earthquake 40 million), Hurricane Idalia 40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 23 million), the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 15 million), Typhoon Mawar 11 million) and the 2023 second quarter U.S. storms 4 million), partially offset by 20 million of reinsurance recoverables related to Hurricane Ian. Prior year incurred favorable development of 31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a reduction in prior year catastrophe reserves. 
 
 Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage expense increased by 14.7 to 428 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 373 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commission and brokerage expense increased by 12.1 to 1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were mainly due to changes in the mix of business. 
 Segment other underwriting expenses increased to 56 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment other underwriting expenses increased to 148 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 120 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were mainly due to expenditures supporting the increased premium volume of the segment. 
 
 Insurance. 
 The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Insurance segment for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Variance Change 2024 2023 Variance Change Gross written premiums 811 904 (93) (10.3) 2,741 2,917 (176) (6.0) Net written premiums 572 666 (94) (14.1) 1,935 2,206 (271) (12.3) Premiums earned 673 722 (48) (6.7) 2,042 2,172 (130) (6.0) Incurred losses and LAE 470 472 (2) (0.4) 1,383 1,419 (37) (2.6) Commission and brokerage 70 80 (10) (12.6) 213 234 (21) (8.9) Other underwriting expenses 100 103 (3) (2.9) 301 304 (3) (1.1) Underwriting gain (loss) 32 65 (33) (50.5) 146 214 (69) (32.1) Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 69.9 65.5 4.4 67.7 65.4 2.3 Commission and brokerage ratio 10.4 11.1 (0.7) 10.4 10.8 (0.4) Other underwriting expense ratio 14.9 14.3 0.6 14.7 14.0 0.7 Combined ratio 95.2 90.9 4.3 92.8 90.2 2.6

 Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 10.3 to 811 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 904 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in insurance premiums was primarily due to portfolio actions taken within the accident and health, workers compensation and specialty casualty lines of business, partially offset by an increase in property/short tail business and specialty business. Gross written premiums decreased by 6.0 to 2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in insurance premiums reflects the impact of portfolio actions taken primarily within the accident and health and workers compensation lines of business, partially offset by the property/short tail and specialty lines of business. 
 Net written premiums decreased by 14.1 to 572 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 666 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net written premiums decreased by 12.3 to 1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases were mainly due to an increase in premium cession, driven by business mix and lower retention in certain lines of business. 
 38 

Premiums earned decreased 6.7 to 673 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 722 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned decreased by 6.0 to 2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in premiums earned is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period, whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. 
 
 Incurred Losses and LAE. The following tables present the incurred losses and LAE for the Insurance segment for the periods indicated.

 Incurred losses and LAE decreased by 0.4 to 470 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 472 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease of 17 million in current year attritional losses, partially offset by an increase of 14 million in current year catastrophe losses. The 24 million of current year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to Hurricane Helene 16 million) and Hurricane Beryl 10 million). The 10 million of current year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 5 million) and the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 5 million). 
 
 Incurred losses and LAE decreased by 2.6 to 1,383 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,419 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease of 65 million in current year attritional losses, partially offset by an increase of 25 million in current year catastrophe losses.

current year catastrophe losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 16 million), Hurricane Beryl 10 million) and the 2024 second quarter U.S. convective storms 10 million). The 11 million of current year catastrophe losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 5 million), the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 5 million) and the 2023 New Zealand storms 1 million). 
 
 Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage expenses decreased by 12.6 to 70 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 80 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commission and brokerage expenses decreased by 8.9 to 213 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 234 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases were mainly due to changes in the mix of business. 
 Segment other underwriting expenses decreased slightly, to 100 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 103 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment other underwriting expenses decreased to 301 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 304 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases are consistent with the decreases in written premiums. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Capital. Stockholder s equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 8.6 billion and 7.2 billion, respectively. Management s objective in managing capital is to ensure its overall capital level, as well as the capital levels of its operating subsidiaries, exceed the amounts required by regulators, the amount needed to support our current financial strength ratings from rating agencies and our own economic capital models. The Company s capital has historically exceeded these benchmark levels. 
 Our main operating company, Everest Reinsurance Company Everest Re ), is regulated by the State of Delaware s Department of Insurance. The regulatory body has its own capital adequacy models based on statutory capital as opposed to GAAP basis equity. Failure to meet the required statutory capital levels could result in various regulatory restrictions. 
 The regulatory targeted capital and the actual statutory capital for Everest Re was as follows: 
 Everest Re (1) 
 At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Regulatory targeted capital 4,242 3,353 Actual capital 6,963 5,553 
 (1) Regulatory targeted capital represents 200 of the RBC authorized control level calculation for the applicable year. 
 Our financial strength ratings, as determined by A.M. Best, Standard Poor s and Moody s, are important, as they provide our customers and investors with an independent assessment of our financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons. We continue to possess significant financial flexibility and access to debt markets as a result of our financial strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. 
 We maintain our own economic capital models to monitor and project our overall capital, as well as the capital at our operating subsidiaries. A key input to the economic models is projected income, and this input is continually compared to actual results, which may require a change in the capital strategy. 
 We may continue, from time to time, to seek to retire portions of our outstanding debt securities through cash repurchases, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be subject to and depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. 
 Liquidity. Our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, with disbursements generally taking place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. Our net cash flows from operating activities were 2.0 billion and 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 40 

If disbursements for losses and LAE, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows, cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash inflows from investment maturities of both short-term investments and longer-term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows. We do not expect to supplement negative insurance operations cash flows with investment dispositions. 
 As the timing of payments for losses and LAE cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain portfolios of long-term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cash and short-term investments of 2.6 billion and 1.8 billion, respectively. Our short-term investments are generally readily marketable and can be converted to cash. In addition to these cash and short-term investments, at September 30, 2024, we had 429 million of fixed maturity securities - available for sale maturing within one year or less, 3.1 billion maturing within one to five years and 4.8 billion maturing after five years. We believe that these fixed maturity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses and LAE in the near future. We do not anticipate selling a significant amount of securities to pay losses and LAE. At September 30, 2024, we had 12 million of net pre-tax unrealized depreciation related to fixed maturity - available for sale securities, comprised of 364 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation and 352 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation. 
 Management generally expects annual positive cash flow from operations, which reflects the strength of overall pricing, as well as the growth in business written. However, given the catastrophic events observed in recent periods, cash flow from operations may decline and could become negative in the near term as significant claim payments are made related to the catastrophes. However, as indicated above, the Company has ample liquidity to settle its catastrophe claims and/or any payments due for its catastrophe bond program. 
 In addition to our cash flows from operations and liquid investments, Everest Re is a member of the FHLBNY, which allows Everest Re to borrow up to 10 of its statutory admitted assets. As of September 30, 2024, Everest Re had statutory admitted assets of approximately 29.2 billion which provides borrowing capacity of up to approximately 2.9 billion. As of September 30, 2024, Everest Re had 819 million of borrowings outstanding, which begin to expire in 2024. See Note 9 Federal Home Loan Bank Membership to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 Market Sensitive Instruments. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). We do not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. 
 Our current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position. The fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio are comprised of available for sale and held to maturity securities. Additionally, we have invested in equity securities. 
 The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period. 
 Interest Rate Risk. Our 26.2 billion investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk, and some equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk. The overall economic impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. 
 Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio from a change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, interest rate risk includes prepayment risk on the 4.3 billion of 
 41 

mortgage-backed securities in the 18.6 billion fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life, and thus, the expected yield of the security. 
 The table below displays the potential impact of fair value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including 2.1 billion of short-term investments) for the period indicated based on upward and downward parallel shifts of 100 and 200 basis points in interest rates. The market value change under the various interest rate changes scenarios was estimated by taking duration into account, with modeling done at the individual security level. 
 Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At September 30, 2024 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Fair Value 21,937 21,283 20,628 19,974 19,319 Fair Value Change from Base ) 6.3 3.2 (3.2) (6.3) Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ) 1,034 517 (517) (1,034) 
 We had 16.9 billion and 15.8 billion of gross reserves for losses and LAE as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to present value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the present value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the present value increases. These movements are similar to the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments held. While the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. Our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration that is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio. 
 Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of our non-U.S. operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Each non-U.S. operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these non-U.S. operations are the Singapore and Canadian Dollars. We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, the impact on the fair value of available for sale fixed maturities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, is reflected as part of other comprehensive income. Conversely, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, on other assets and liabilities is reflected through net income as a component of other income (expense). In addition, we translate the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company s rights and obligations under insurance and reinsurance agreements. In some disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and are ultimately resolved through both informal and formal means, including negotiated resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the Company believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. The Company considers the statuses of these proceedings when determining its reserves for unpaid loss and LAE. 
 Aside from litigation and arbitrations related to these insurance and reinsurance agreements, the Company is not a party to any other material litigation or arbitration.
