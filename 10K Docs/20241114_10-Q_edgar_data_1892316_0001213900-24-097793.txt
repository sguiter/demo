Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The preparation of such financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to useful lives of real
estate assets, bad debts, impairment, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual
results will not differ from those estimates. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of the Company s
financial condition and results of operations is based upon its condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and
material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. 

In connection with the preparation of our financial
statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no accounting estimate made which was (a) subject to a high degree
of uncertainty and (b) material to our results.

During the three months
ended September 30, 2024, our total revenue was 769,072, of which 46,595 was attributable to the sale of healthcare services, primarily
derived from sales of Immunological Ozonated Autohemotherapy , Meridian-regulating and Consciousness-restoring Iatrotechnics ,
 Assay , PRP and other healthcare services. The remaining 722,477 of revenue was attributable to commissions
earned by the Company from its service as sales agent for Honghai. In June of 2023, the Company began to engage in the sales agent business
and focused on the sales of preventive healthcare solutions administered by Honghai, with whom we have a Sales Agency Agreement. As of
September 30, 2024, we operate through five entities: Longduoduo Health Technology, Tianju, Qingguo, Rongbin and Chengheng, which are
established in Ordos, Ulanqab, Huhhot, Baotou and Ordos, respectively, which include four of the largest cities in Inner Mongolia, China. 

Quarter to quarter revenue
fell by 52 as compared with the operating revenue of 1,587,433 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily
attributable to the fact that Neimenggu Province was emerging from the pandemic during the three months ended September 30, 2023. A large
number of customers received services during that quarter that they had earlier paid for but could not receive. This resulted in a surge
in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023. One other important factor influencing revenue in the recent quarter is the
impact of the economic environment, which has led to a decrease in customer health expenditures. Management believes that the government
has recently introduced policies to promote economic recovery, but it may take some time for the situation to truly improve. Meanwhile,
as we wait for the economy to revive, the Company is implementing plans to improve its operations by adjusting its operational policies. 

Cost of revenue
relates solely to our service revenue, and mainly consists of our payments to the third-party healthcare service providers who perform
healthcare services for our customers. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of revenue was 32,276, with the result
that our gross profit from service revenue was 14,319 (a gross margin of 31 ). By comparison, our gross profit from service revenue for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 109,579, representing 63 of service revenue for that quarter. 

When our net service revenue in the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was combined with commission revenue (for which there is no cost of revenue), we achieved gross profit of 769,072.
However, we realized a 62,076 loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 because the Company incurred significant
marketing expense in connection with establishing its brand as a new company. The Company will continue to invest heavily in advertising
and promotion expenses in the near future as it continues to establish and expand its brand and products and services. 

Our operating expenses consist primarily of advertising
and promotion expenses, salaries and benefits, office expenses, professional fees and depreciation and amortization. Our operating expenses
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 291,928, primarily attributable to: 

308,910
in advertising and promotion expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 654,452 recorded during
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a tactical decision by Management to reduce
marketing expense while we await an economic recovery that will fund an increase in non-essential medical expenditures. Over the longer
term, we intend to continue to devote available resources to expanded advertising and promotion expense for the purpose of achieving
a broader market. 

135,321
in salaries and benefit expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 186,651 during the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in our labor costs was primarily caused by the company decreasing the number of employees due to adjustments in
its operational policies. 

208,623
in office expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 203,965 during the three months ended September 30,
2024. Our office expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were roughly equivalent to office expense in the three months
ended September 30, 2023, despite the 52 reduction in revenue, because our business has matured, resulting in fixed daily expenses. 

Our net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 59,504, compared to a net income of 294,744 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the reasons discussed above,
we believe that the company will return to profitability in the next quarter or at the beginning of 2025, as the government has recently
introduced many policies to promote economic recovery. But it may take some time for the situation to truly improve. Also, the company
will intends to improve its operations by adjusting its operational policies.

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our
local currency, the Renminbi (RMB), is our functional currency. Results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange
rates during the period being reported upon, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by OANDA
on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in other comprehensive income (loss). For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, foreign currency translation adjustments of 46,989 and (1,148), respectively,
have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 849,840
in cash and cash equivalents. On the same date, we had a working capital of only 347,732, because we had received 608,106 from customers
as prepayment for future services and products but used the majority of the deposited sum to pay ongoing expenses. As a result, our September
30, 2024 balance sheet included only 162,593 of prepayments among our current assets, while recording 608,106 of deferred revenue among
our current liabilities. Going forward, we will strive to achieve a better balance of customer deposits and prepayments; but we will achieve
that better balance only when profits from operations and funds from financing are adequate to support the expansion effort that will
be necessary for successful operations. 

We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements
will arise from the need to fund our growth, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for
such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and additional funds from a public offering and/or debt financing.
We expect Zhang Liang, our majority shareholder, to continue to provide support in the future, if needed. However, we can provide no assurances
that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us,
if at all, to remain a going concern. 

Cash Flows

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we used 534,998 cash in our operating activities, compared to 383,169 used in operating activities for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Our use of cash in operating activities substantially exceeded our net loss of 59,504 for the three month period, primarily
because we provided services valued at 128,263 to customers who had paid for the services in prior periods, thus reducing our deferred
revenue balance, and we used 198,911 to reduce accounts payable. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 was 56,431, compared to 20,849 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In both periods,
the cash was used for the purchase of fixed assets and office decoration.

Trends, Events and Uncertainties 

The U.S. government, including the SEC, has made
statements and taken actions that have led to changes in relations between the U.S. and China, and will impact companies with connections
to the United States or China. Those actions by the U.S. government included imposing several rounds of tariffs affecting certain products
manufactured in China and imposing sanctions and restrictions in relation to China. Actions by the SEC included issuing statements indicating
that it would make enhanced review of companies with significant China-based operations. It is unknown whether and to what extent new
legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws or regulations will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on U.S.-domiciled
companies with significant connections to China, our industry or on us. Any unfavorable government policies on cross-border relations,
including increased scrutiny on companies with significant China-based operations, capital controls or tariffs, may affect our ability
to raise capital and the market price of our shares. If any new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws and/or regulations are implemented,
if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if the U.S. or Chinese governments take retaliatory actions due to the recent U.S.-China
tensions, such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise
capital and the market price of our shares. Changes in United States and China relations and/or regulations may adversely impact our business,
our operating results, our ability to raise capital and the market price of our shares. 

Other than the factors listed above we do not know of any trends, events
or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our net sales or revenues or income from continuing
operations. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

There were no recent accounting pronouncements
that we expect to have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. Please refer to Note 2 of
our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management maintains disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have
the following material weaknesses: 

The relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system. 

Our internal financial staff lack expertise in identifying and addressing complex accounting issues under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

Our Chief Financial Officer is not familiar with the accounting and reporting requirements of a U.S. public company. 

We have not developed sufficient documentation concerning our existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls. 

Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective
as of September 30, 2024 for the purposes described in this paragraph. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During the period covered by this report, there
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.
