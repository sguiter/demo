CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 In addition to factors previously identified elsewhere in the reports and other documents that Diameter Credit Company (the "Company", "we", "us", and "our") has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: 
 changes in laws and regulations, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, and changes in the interest rate environment or other conditions affecting the financial and capital markets; 

an economic downturn and the time period required for robust economic recovery therefrom could (i) impair our portfolio companies results of operations and financial condition for its duration, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in those portfolio companies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; (ii) disproportionately impact the companies in which we have invested and others that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; and (iii) impact availability and pricing of our financing; 

an inability to access the capital markets or additional sources of liquidity could impair our ability to raise capital and our investment activities; 

interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly given that we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 

currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 

inflation could negatively impact our business, including our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms, or could negatively impact our portfolio companies; 

risks associated with possible disruption in our or our portfolio companies operations due to wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify elsewhere in our filings with the SEC that we make from time to time. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law.

and , respectively, in non-recurring interest income (e.g., prepayment premiums and accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts). PIK Income The Company has loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. Such income is included in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest is generally reversed through interest income. To satisfy the Company's annual RIC distribution requirements, this non-cash source of income must be included in determining the amounts to be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected cash. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded and , respectively, in PIK income. Fee Income The Company may receive various fees in the ordinary course of business such as structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication and other miscellaneous fees as well as fees for managerial assistance rendered by the Company to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned, as services are rendered. Non-Accrual Income Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt whether principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Additionally, any original issue discount and/or market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

of total Capital Commitments and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than prior to the proposed reimbursement. A Liquidity Event may include (i) consummating an Exchange Listing (as defined below) or (ii) commencing a general or limited tender offer program in which each shareholder is given the opportunity to tender Common Shares at a per share price based on the Company s net asset value or other applicable measurement; provided, however, that the Company will not commence such a tender offer program without the approval of at least a majority of Common Shares outstanding. For these purposes, an Exchange Listing is a quotation or listing of the Company s securities on a national securities exchange (including through an initial public offering) or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets to, or a merger or other liquidity transaction with, an entity in which the Company s shareholders receive shares of a publicly-traded company which continues to be managed by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof; provided, however, that the Company will not commence such an Exchange Listing unless such Exchange Listing is approved by our Board, including a majority of the members of the Board who are not interested persons of the Company or the Adviser as defined in the 1940 Act Independent Trustees ). As of September 30, 2024 , the Company did not incur any organization and offering costs in excess of of the Company s total Capital Commitments. Any sales load, platform fees, servicing fees or similar fees or expenses charged directly to an investor in an offering by a placement agent or similar party will not be considered organization or offering expenses of the Company for purposes of the Company s cap on organization and offering expenses. 
 
 of its investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that the estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, the Company accrues excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. The Company makes certain adjustments to the classification of net assets as a result of permanent book-to-tax differences such as non-deductible expenses. To the extent these differences are permanent, they are charged to additional paid in capital. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company did not incur any U.S. federal excise tax.

components a base management fee (the Management Fee and an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee ). The cost of both the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee will be borne by the Company s shareholders. Management Fee The Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s gross assets, payable quarterly in arrears, subject to the fee waiver described below. The Management Fee will be calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Management Fees for any partial quarter will be prorated. For these purposes, gross assets means the Company s total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding undrawn commitments but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross assets were measured as the average of gross assets at the initial date that investors are required to purchase Common Shares (the "Effective Date") and at September 30, 2024, adjusted for share issuances during the quarter. The Adviser has agreed to waive all Management Fees in excess of of the Company's gross assets until the four-year anniversary of the Effective Date, which occurred on January 19, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Management Fees earned were and , respectively, and of which were waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024, was payable to the Adviser relating to Management Fees. Incentive Fee The Incentive Fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on a percentage of the Company s pre-Incentive Fee net investment income, and a portion is based on a percentage of the Company s capital gains, each as described below. Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income: The first component of the Incentive Fee, which is payable only following the four-year anniversary of the Effective Date, will be payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, and will equal of the Company s pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a quarterly hurdle rate , the calculation of which is further explained below, until the Adviser has received of the Company s total pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter and for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of annualized) quarterly, of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter. The catch-up provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate annualized) is intended to provide the Adviser with an Incentive Fee of on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals in a quarter annualized), which is the rate at which catch-up is achieved. Once the hurdle rate is reached and catch-up is achieved, of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter is payable to the Adviser. Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income means dividends (including reinvested dividends), interest and fee income accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to the Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company may not have 

 14 

and , respectively, all of which were waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024 , amounts were payable to the Adviser for Incentive Fees based on pre-Incentive Fee net investment income. Capital Gains Fee: The second component of the Incentive Fee, which is payable only following the anniversary of the Effective Date, will be payable at the end of each fiscal year in arrears, and will equal of the Company s cumulative realized capital gains from the fiscal quarter following the anniversary of the Effective Date to the end of that fiscal year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation (the "Capital Gains Fee"). Each year, the fee paid for this component of the Incentive Fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee for prior periods. The Company accrues, but does not pay, a Capital Gains Fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a Capital Gains Fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investments and realize a capital gain. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Incentive Fees on capital gains were earned. As of September 30, 2024 , amounts were payable to the Adviser for Incentive Fees based on capital gains. Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the Incentive Fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an Incentive Fee in a quarter in which the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, the Company will pay the applicable Incentive Fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. In addition, because the quarterly minimum hurdle rate is calculated based on the Company s net assets, decreases in the Company s net assets due to realized or unrealized capital losses in any given quarter may increase the likelihood that the hurdle rate is reached and therefore the likelihood of the Company paying an Incentive Fee for that quarter. The Company s net investment income used to calculate this component of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of the Company s gross assets used to calculate the Management Fee because gross assets are total assets (including cash received) before deducting liabilities (such as declared dividend payments). The Company accrues the Incentive Fee taking into account unrealized gains and losses; however, Section 205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act, as amended, prohibits the Adviser from receiving the payment of fees until those gains are realized, if ever. The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Administration Agreement On December 12, 2023, the Company entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with an affiliate of the Adviser, Diameter Finance Administration LLC (the Administrator ). Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services to the Company. These services include, but are not limited to, providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Administrator under the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, the Administrator is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties, and the Company pays or reimburses the Administrator for certain expenses incurred by any such affiliates or third parties for work done on its behalf.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, was unpaid and included in Due to affiliates, subject to amounts waived by the Adviser, in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Sub-Administration Agreement On December 21, 2023, the Administrator entered into a sub-administration agreement (the Sub-Administration Agreement with HedgeServ Corporation (the Sub-Administrator under which the Sub-Administrator provides various accounting and administrative services to the Company. The initial term of the Sub-Administration Agreement is from the Effective Date, and, after expiration of the initial term, the Sub-Administration Agreement shall automatically renew for successive periods, unless a written notice of non-renewal is delivered prior to prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal term. Expense Support Agreement On December 12, 2023, the Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Adviser may elect to pay certain of the Company s expenses on the Company s behalf (each, an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees of the Company. Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar month in which the Company s Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), the Company shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Company s net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). No Reimbursement Payment for any month will be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share (as defined below) declared by the Company at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) the Company s Operating Expense Ratio (as defined below) at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365 day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, Management Fees and Incentive Fees owed to the Adviser, and interest expense, by the Company s net assets. The Company s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment shall automatically become a liability of the Company on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month.

 transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2024 . The following section describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized. Investments Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with all portfolio companies originated on or prior to June 30, 2024 without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. All investments originated after June 30, 2024 were held at amortized cost due to recency of an open market transaction. As of September 30, 2024, all money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents were valued using Level 1 inputs. When determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company takes into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that affect the price at which similar investments are made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). A portfolio company s EBITDA can include pro forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be

The significant unobservable input used in the yield analysis is the discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value Debt The fair value of the Company s Revolving Credit Facilities, which would be categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as of September 30, 2024, approximates carrying value as the Revolving Credit Facilities have variable interest based on selected short-term rates.

Distribution Reinvestment The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan DRIP ), pursuant to which it will reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then the Company s shareholders who have not opted out of its DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. A participating shareholder will receive an amount of shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant s shares divided by the most recent quarter-end net asset value NAV per share that is available on the date such distribution was paid (unless the Board determines to use the NAV per share as of another time). Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those shareholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. The Company intends to use newly issued shares to implement the plan. Shares issued under the DRIP will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Ana lysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 (All figures in this item are in thousands except share, per share and other data.) 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this quarterly report contain forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and other factors outside of our control. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 Overview and Investment Framework 
 We are a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we expect to qualify as a RIC annually. We are managed by our Adviser. The Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income by targeting direct lending and related investments with favorable risk-adjusted returns. 
 We seek to generate current income primarily by investing in the debt of private, U.S. domiciled, sponsored and non-sponsored middle-market and upper middle-market companies. Some of this debt may be directly originated by us, by which we mean that we will negotiate and structure material terms of the transaction other than just the price. Alternatively, we may participate in transactions where third parties are equally or more involved in the negotiation and structuring with the company, including club deals, or transactions with a bank or advisor acting as an intermediary. 
 Our core focus on middle market companies refers to companies with annual EBITDA between 25 million and 125 million. We refer to companies with annual EBITDA equal to or greater than approximately 125 million as upper middle-market companies . By non-sponsored companies, we generally mean companies whose equity is substantially owned by the founders or public companies, or companies whose equity is substantially owned by family offices, endowments, or alternative investment funds. 
 We focus on what we consider to be high quality, performing borrowers in stable or growing industries. Our process prioritizes borrower quality, and capital preservation over yield, to select investments that offer current income. Under normal circumstances, we will invest directly or indirectly at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in credit instruments (including, but not limited to, loans, bonds and other credit instruments, such as first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt) of varying maturities. The Company s 80 policy with respect to investments in debt instruments is not fundamental and may be changed by our Board without shareholder approval. Shareholders will be provided with sixty (60) days notice in the manner prescribed by the SEC before making any change to this policy. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the debt investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to eight years and bear interest at floating rates on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity may also reflect the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our debt investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we generate revenue in the form of prepayment and other fees in connection with transactions. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on debt investments as interest income when earned. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 In addition, we may generate revenue from various fees in the ordinary course of business such as in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication, due diligence and other miscellaneous fees as well as fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and consulting fees.

Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, when and to the extent that the investment professionals and staff of the Adviser are engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, the allocable portions of their base compensation, bonus and benefits, routine overhead expenses, and other costs and expenses will be paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including the Management Fees and Incentive Fees that are paid to the Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. We also bear our allocable portion of the compensation, overhead (including rent, IT assistance, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement. These administrative expenses include the salaries and expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer, and their respective staffs, and the salaries and expenses of the investor relations, legal, operations, and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that perform duties for us. 
 From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services on our behalf. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator and their affiliates for any such amounts. The Administrator has elected to forgo any reimbursement for rent and other occupancy costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, the Administrator may seek reimbursement for such costs in future periods. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders. 
 Costs and expenses of the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by us will be reasonably allocated on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator in accordance with policies adopted by the Board.

As of September 30, 2024, no loans in the portfolio were on non-accrual status. 
 Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company's industry; and 

review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

26 

As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may take into account the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 1. Least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. Trends and risk factors are above expectations since time of initial underwriting. 

2. Trends and risk factors are similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. Portfolio company is performing generally in line with initial underwrite and risk is neutral to favorable. 

3. Portfolio company is performing below expectations, and the risk to the loan has increased since time of origination. Portfolio company could be out of compliance with covenants other than payment defaults. Loan payments are typically not past due. 

4. Portfolio company performance is materially lower than anticipated at initial underwrite, and the risk to the loan is materially higher. Portfolio company is generally out of compliance with covenants. Loan payments could be past due but generally not more than 180 days past due. 

5. Portfolio company is underperforming substantially below expectations. It is anticipated we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss relative to our cost basis at exit. Loan payments are significantly delinquent and fair market value will be reduced to the anticipated recovery.

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in borrowings in our Revolving Credit Facilities and Repurchase Obligations. Management Fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were driven by our deployment of capital. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Adviser waived Management Fees of 1,127 and 1,885, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Incentive Fees earned related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income were 1,559 and 2,876, respectively, all of which was waived by the Adviser. There were no accrued capital gains Incentive Fees based on our cumulative net realized and unrealized depreciation as of period end. The accrual for any capital gains Incentive Fees under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Organization costs and offering costs, if any, include expenses incurred in our initial formation and our Private Offering. Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of us. Administrative services represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers, their respective staff and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. 
 We entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 Net Unrealized Gain 
 We fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio was 2,928 and 5,480, respectively. 
 
 28 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of drawdowns on our Capital Commitments, proceeds from net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facilities, proceeds from net borrowings on our Repurchase Obligations, and income earned on our debt investments. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (i) originating loans and purchases of senior secured debt investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to the Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to the Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our Common Shares. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facilities and uncalled Capital Commitments are sufficient to meet our obligations, support our investing activities and enable us to conduct our operations in the near term. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had the Citi Revolving Credit Facility and MS Revolving Credit Facility outstanding, as described in Borrowings below. We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred shares, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred shares, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate amount of 403,085 of senior securities outstanding, our asset coverage ratio was 205.3 , and our asset coverage per unit was 2,059. On December 12, 2023, our sole initial shareholder approved the adoption of this 150 threshold pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As of such date, our initial shareholder was the only holder of our Common Shares and it waived the right to receive repurchase offers pursuant to Section 61(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the 1940 Act. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 35,352 in cash and cash equivalents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 772,675, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments offset by proceeds from principal repayments and net investment income for the period. Cash provided by financing activities was 805,147 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares and net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facilities and Repurchase Obligations.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into Subscription Agreements with a number of investors, including affiliates of the Adviser, providing for the private placement of our Common Shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our Common Shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. As of September 30, 2024, we had received Capital Commitments totaling 1,623,620, of which 32,650 was from affiliates of the Adviser. 
 Borrowings 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of 401,585 of net borrowings outstanding. 
 For additional information on our debt obligations see Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 

the Administration Agreement; and 

29 

Expense Support Agreement. 

In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser and certain of our Adviser s affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors described in our Registration Statement on Form 10, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2024. 
 We apply fair value to all of our financial instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 820. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, we have categorized our financial instruments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date. 
 The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3. 
 Any changes to the valuation methodology are reviewed by management and our Board to confirm that the changes are appropriate. As markets change, new products develop and the pricing for products becomes more or less transparent, we will continue to refine its valuation methodologies. See further description of fair value methodology in Note 5. Fair Value Measurements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitati ve and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Uncertainty with respect to the economic conditions has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effect of the volatility could materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our audit committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 30 

As of September 30, 2024, 92.34 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure):
