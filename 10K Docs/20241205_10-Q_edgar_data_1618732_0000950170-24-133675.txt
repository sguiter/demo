 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains express and implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Other than statements of historical fact, all statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words "believe," "may," "will," "potentially," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "could," "would," "expect," or words or expressions of similar substance or the negative thereof, that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: 
 our investment in the profitable growth of our business over the long run, including the development of our solutions and investing in sales and marketing to capitalize on our market opportunities, while improving our operating cash flow performance by focusing on creating operational efficiencies throughout our organization, including go-to-market efficiencies, particularly by generating leverage through partnerships; 

continuing our focus on opportunities with major accounts, large deals, and commercial accounts, as well as other sales and marketing initiatives to increase our pipeline growth; 

our intent in the long term to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, including our newer subscription-based products, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of technologies and features available through our platform; 

our continued investment in our growth by strengthening our core offerings, investing in our solution ecosystem, and taking advantage of emerging opportunities around generative artificial intelligence and modern applications across hybrid and mutlicloud environments; 

our plan to continue to leverage our relationships with our channel and OEM partners and expand our network of cloud and ecosystem partners; 

the recent evolution of our sales pipeline and its expected effect on our ability to land new customers and expand sales to existing customers, which may adversely affect our top-line results; 

our expectations regarding our ability to recruit, train and retain sufficient numbers of ramped up sales personnel to support our growth, including how long it takes to ramp up sales personnel, and the expected contribution to revenue growth; 

expected sales productivity; 

expected increases in costs and expenses, including sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses; 

our intent to reduce our overall sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue, including by improving the efficiency of our demand generation spend, focusing on lower cost renewals, and optimizing headcount in geographies based on market opportunities; 

sustaining profitable growth; 

fluctuations in hardware revenue and cost of product revenue; 

the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and our expected net cash provided by operating activities to meet anticipated cash needs; 

our expectations that neither our operating results nor cash flows would be materially affected by any sudden change in interest rates; and 

anticipated trends, opportunities and challenges in our business and in the markets in which we operate.

Table of Contents 

 We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives and financial needs in light of the information currently available to us. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or will occur. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update, alter or otherwise revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated or subsequent events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.

Professional services 

Other non-subscription product 

Total revenue 

Subscription revenue Subscription revenue includes any performance obligation which has a defined term and is generated from the sales of software entitlement and support subscriptions, subscription software licenses and cloud-based SaaS offerings. Ratable We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support subscriptions and SaaS offerings ratably over the contractual service period, the substantial majority of which relate to software entitlement and support subscriptions. These offerings represented approximately million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024. 

 Upfront Revenue from our subscription software licenses is generally recognized upfront upon transfer of control to the customer, which happens when we make the software available to the customer. These subscription software licenses represented approximately million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024. 

 Professional services revenue We also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.

 million of non-portable software revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023, million of non-portable software revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024, million of hardware revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023, and million of hardware revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024. Non-portable software revenue Non-portable software revenue includes sales of our platform when delivered on a configured-to-order server by us or one of our OEM partners. The software licenses associated with these sales are typically non-portable and can be used over the life of the server on which the software is delivered. Revenue from our non-portable software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. 

 Hardware revenue In the infrequent transactions where the hardware platform is purchased directly from Nutanix, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. 

 Contracts with multiple performance obligations The majority of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ("SSP") basis. For deliverables that we routinely sell separately, such as software entitlement and support subscriptions on our core offerings, we determine SSP by evaluating the standalone sales over the trailing 12 months. For those that are not sold routinely, we determine SSP based on our overall pricing trends and objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the products sold and geographic locations. Contract balances The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. A receivable is recognized in the period in which we deliver goods or provide services, or when our right to consideration is unconditional. In situations where revenue recognition occurs before invoicing, an unbilled receivable is created, which represents a contract asset. The balance of unbilled accounts receivable, included in accounts receivable, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, was million and million as of July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2024, respectively. Our customers are typically invoiced upfront, including invoices for multi-year subscriptions, with payment terms of 30-45 days. We assess credit losses on accounts receivable by taking into consideration past collection experience, the credit quality of the customer, the age of the receivable balance, current and future economic conditions, and forecasts that may affect the collectability of the reported amount. The balance of accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, as of July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2024 is presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Costs to obtain and fulfill a contract We capitalize commissions paid to sales personnel and the related payroll taxes when customer contracts are signed. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, current and non-current. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our sales compensation plans if the commissions are incremental and would not have been incurred absent the execution of the customer contract. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are recognized over the estimated period of benefit, which may exceed the term of the initial contract if the commissions expected to be paid upon renewal are not commensurate with that of the initial contract. Accordingly, deferred costs are recognized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition allocated to each performance obligation over the entire period of benefit and included in sales and marketing expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. We determine the estimated period of benefit by evaluating the expected renewals of customer contracts, the duration of relationships with our customers, customer retention data, our technology development lifecycle and other factors. Deferred costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. Taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue transactions between us and our customers are presented on a net basis in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Balance as of October 31, 2024 

(1) 

During the three months ended October 31, 2023 , we recognized revenue of approximately million pertaining to amounts deferred as of July 31, 2023. During the three months ended October 31, 2024 , we recognized revenue of approximately million pertaining to amounts deferred as of July 31, 2024. Many of our contracted but not invoiced performance obligations are subject to cancellation terms. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized ("contracted not recognized"), which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods and excludes performance obligations that are subject to cancellation terms. Contracted not recognized revenue was approximately billion as of October 31, 2024 , of which we expect to recognize approximately over the next 12 months, and the remainder thereafter.

The carrying value of the 2027 Notes as of July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2024 was net of unamortized debt issuance costs of million and million, respectively. The total estimated fair value of the 2027 Notes was determined based on the closing trading price per of the 2027 Notes as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the 2027 Notes to be a Level II valuation due to the limited trading activity.

million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes to BCPE Nucleon (DE) SPV, LP, an entity affiliated with Bain Capital, LP ("Bain"). The 2026 Notes bore interest at a rate of per annum, with such interest paid in kind ("PIK") on the 2026 Notes held by Bain through an increase in the principal amount of the 2026 Notes, and to be paid in cash on any 2026 Notes transferred to entities that are not affiliated with Bain. Interest on the 2026 Notes accrued from the date of issuance, September 24, 2020, and was added to the principal amount on a semi-annual basis (on March 15 and September 15 of each year).

 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes, representing all of the outstanding principal amount as of that date. Under the terms of the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, the conversion was settled by paying the million principal amount in cash and delivering the conversion spread of approximately million shares of our Class A common stock. The cash portion was settled using a portion of our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The 2026 Notes were converted in accordance with its original terms and conditions. Upon conversion, because the carrying amount of the conversion option was previously reclassified to equity, the unamortized discount remaining at the date of conversion was recognized as interest expense. The remaining carrying amount of the 2026 Notes was reduced by the cash transferred and then recognized in equity, such that no gain or loss was recognized. In addition, the accrued and unpaid interest as of the conversion date was forgiven pursuant to the terms of the indenture and recognized in equity. 

Interest expense related to amortization of debt issuance costs 

Non-cash interest expense 

Total interest expense 

Non-cash interest expense was related to the PIK interest that we accrued from the issuance of the 2026 Notes through the conversion date and was recognized within other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and other liabilities non-current in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The accrued PIK interest was converted to the principal balance of the 2026 Notes at each payment date. 2027 Notes In September 2021, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2027 consisting of (i) approximately million principal amount of 2027 Notes in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the previously outstanding convertible senior notes due 2023 (the " 2023 Notes") (the "Exchange Transactions") and (ii) approximately million principal amount of 2027 Notes for cash (the "Subscription Transactions"). We did not receive any cash proceeds from the Exchange Transactions. The net cash proceeds from the Subscription Transactions were approximately million after deducting the offering expenses for both the Exchange Transactions and the Subscription Transactions. We used (i) approximately million of the net cash proceeds from the Subscription Transactions to repurchase approximately million principal amount of the 2023 Notes and (ii) approximately million of the net cash proceeds from the Subscription Transactions to repurchase approximately million shares of our Class A common stock. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum, and pay interest semi-annually in arrears on each April 1 and October 1. The 2027 Notes will mature on October 1, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

 of principal of the 2027 Notes is initially convertible into shares of our Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Holders of these 2027 Notes may convert their 2027 Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of the business day immediately preceding July 1, 2027, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter, and only during such fiscal quarter, if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the then applicable conversion price for the Notes per share of common stock; 

 (2) during the five business day period after any consecutive five trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per principal amount of 2027 Notes for such trading day was less than of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; 

 (3) if we call the 2027 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 

 (4) upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate events. 

 Upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest. Holders who convert their 2027 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a "make-whole fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. In addition, if we undergo a "fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes) prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2027 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their 2027 Notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the repurchased 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In accounting for the exchange of convertible notes, we evaluated whether the transaction should be treated as a modification or extinguishment transaction. The partial exchange of the 2023 Notes and issuance of the 2027 Notes were deemed to have substantially different terms due to the significant difference between the value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange, and consequently, the 2023 Notes partial exchange was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The million difference between the total reacquisition price paid and the net carrying amount of the 2023 Notes was recognized as a debt extinguishment loss within other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Legal Proceedings We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material to our business or financial condition. From time to time, we may become party to various litigation matters and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. 

 class of outstanding common stock consisting of Class A common stock. As of October 31, 2024 , we had million shares of preferred stock authorized, with a par value of per share, and shares issued and outstanding. As of October 31, 2024 , we had billion shares of Class A common stock authorized, with a par value of per share. As of October 31, 2024 , we had million shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to vote for each share of Class A common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Share Repurchases In August 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our Class A common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. During the three months ended October 31, 2024 , we repurchased million shares of Class A common stock in open market transactions at a weighted average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million. As of October 31, 2024 , million remained available for future share repurchases under the authorization. 

 active equity incentive plan, the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"), and inactive equity incentive plans, the 2010 Stock Plan ("2010 Plan") and the 2011 Stock Plan ("2011 Plan") (collectively, the "Stock Plans"). Our stockholders approved the 2016 Plan in March 2016 and it became effective in connection with our initial public offering ("IPO"). As a result, at the time of the IPO, we ceased granting additional stock awards under the 2010 Plan and 2011 Plan and both plans were terminated. Any outstanding stock awards under the 2010 Plan and 2011 Plan remain outstanding, subject to the terms of the applicable plan and award agreements, until such shares are issued under those stock awards, by exercise of stock options or settlement of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), or until those stock awards become vested or expired by their terms.

 million shares of our Class A common stock for issuance under the 2016 Plan. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan also includes an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal 2018, equal to the lesser of: million shares, of the outstanding shares of all classes of common stock as of the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year, or such other amount as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, on August 1, 2023 and 2024, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan increased by million and million shares, respectively, pursuant to these provisions. As of October 31, 2024 , we had reserved a total of million shares for the issuance of equity awards under the Stock Plans, of which million shares were still available for grant. Restricted Stock Units RSUs settle into shares of Class A common stock upon vesting. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we began funding withholding taxes due on the vesting of employee RSUs by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of selling shares of Class A common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. The payment of the withheld taxes to the tax authorities is reflected as a financing activity within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Performance RSUs From time to time, we grant RSUs that have both service and performance conditions to our executives and employees ("PRSUs"). Vesting of PRSUs is subject to continuous service and the satisfaction of certain performance targets. While we recognize cumulative stock-based compensation expense for the portion of the awards for which both the service condition has been satisfied and it is probable that the performance conditions will be met, the actual vesting and settlement of PRSUs are subject to the performance conditions actually being met. Market Stock Units We also grant RSUs that have both service and market-based conditions to our executives and employees ("MSUs"). Vesting of MSUs is subject to continuous service and the satisfaction of certain market-based performance targets. While we recognize cumulative stock-based compensation expense for the portion of the awards for which the service condition has been satisfied, regardless of achievement of the specified targets, the actual vesting and settlement of MSUs are subject to the market-based conditions actually being met. In August 2023, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the grant of approximately million MSUs to certain of our executives. These MSUs have a weighted average grant date fair value per unit of approximately and will vest up to of the target number of MSUs based upon our total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies in the Nasdaq Composite Index over a performance period of approximately years, subject to continuous service on each vesting date. In September 2024, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the grant of approximately million MSUs to certain of our executives. These MSUs have a weighted average grant date fair value of approximately and will vest up to of the target number of MSUs based upon our total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies in the Nasdaq Composite Index over a performance period of approximately years, subject to continuous service on each vesting date.

As of October 31, 2024 , million stock options, with a weighted average exercise price of per share, a weighted average remaining contractual life of years and an aggregate intrinsic value of million, remained outstanding. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In December 2015, our Board of Directors adopted the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was subsequently amended in January 2016 and September 2016 and approved by our stockholders in March 2016 (the "Original 2016 ESPP"). The Original 2016 ESPP became effective in connection with our IPO. Our stockholders subsequently approved amendments to the Original 2016 ESPP in December 2019 and December 2022 (as amended, the "2016 ESPP"). Under the 2016 ESPP, the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock available for sale is million shares. The 2016 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our Class A common stock at a discount through payroll deductions of up to of eligible compensation, subject to caps of in any calendar year and shares on any purchase date. The 2016 ESPP provides for offering periods, generally beginning in March and September of each year, and each offering period consists of six-month purchase periods. On each purchase date, participating employees will purchase Class A common stock at a price per share equal to of the lesser of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on (i) the first trading day of the applicable offering period or (ii) the last trading day of each purchase period in the applicable offering period. If the stock price of our Class A common stock on any purchase date in an offering period is lower than the stock price on the enrollment date of that offering period, the offering period will immediately reset after the purchase of shares on such purchase date and automatically roll into a new offering period. During the three months ended October 31, 2024 , million shares of common stock were purchased under the 2016 ESPP for an aggregate amount of million. As of October 31, 2024 , million shares were available for future issuance under the 2016 ESPP.

 Overview 
 Nutanix, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," or "Nutanix") is a global leader in cloud software, offering organizations a single platform for running applications and managing data, anywhere. Our vision is to make hybrid multicloud deployments simple and free customers to focus on achieving their business outcomes. Our mission is to delight customers with an open hybrid multicloud platform with rich data services to run and manage any application, anywhere. 
 Our Nutanix Cloud Platform is designed to enable organizations to build a hybrid multicloud infrastructure, providing a consistent cloud operating model with a single platform for running applications and managing data in core data centers, at the edge, and in public clouds, all while supporting a variety of hypervisors and container platforms. Nutanix Cloud Platform supports a wide variety of workloads with varied compute, storage, and network requirements, including business-critical applications, data platforms (including SQL and NoSQL databases and business intelligence applications), general-purpose workloads (including system infrastructure, networking, and security), end-user computing and virtual desktop infrastructure services, enterprise artificial intelligence ("AI") workloads (including machine learning and generative AI workloads), and cloud native applications (including modern, containerized applications). 
 Our business is organized into a single operating and reportable segment. We operate a subscription-based business model, meaning one in which our products, including associated support and entitlement arrangements, are sold with a defined duration. 
 Our platform typically includes one or more years of support and entitlements, which provides customers with the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Purchases of term-based licenses and SaaS subscriptions have support and entitlements included within the subscription fees and are not sold separately. Purchases of non-portable software are typically accompanied by the purchase of separate support and entitlements. 
 We had a broad and diverse base of over 27,000 end customers as of October 31, 2024, including approximately 1,060 Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries, and the total number of end customers may contract due to mergers, acquisitions, or other consolidation among existing end customers. 
 Our solutions are primarily sold through our channel partners or original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and delivered directly to our end customers. We have end customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology, and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers. 
 We continue to invest in the profitable growth of our business over the long run, including the development of our solutions and investing in sales and marketing to capitalize on our market opportunities, while improving our operating cash flow performance by focusing on creating operational efficiencies throughout our organization, including go-to-market efficiencies, particularly by generating leverage through partnerships. By maintaining this balance, we believe that we can sustain profitable growth.

 Subscription revenue Subscription revenue includes any performance obligation which has a defined term and is generated from the sales of software entitlement and support subscriptions, subscription software licenses and cloud-based SaaS offerings. 
 Ratable We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support subscriptions and SaaS offerings ratably over the contractual service period, the substantial majority of which relate to software entitlement and support subscriptions. These offerings represented approximately 253.5 million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 274.4 million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024. 

Upfront Revenue from our subscription software licenses is generally recognized upfront upon transfer of control to the customer, which happens when we make the software available to the customer. These subscription software licenses represented approximately 226.0 million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 286.3 million of our subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024. 

Professional services revenue We also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed. 
 Other non-subscription product revenue Other non-subscription product revenue includes approximately 8.1 million of non-portable software revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023, 1.9 million of non-portable software revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024, 0.6 million of hardware revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023, and 1.1 million of hardware revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024. 
 Non-portable software revenue Non-portable software revenue includes sales of our platform when delivered on a configured-to-order server by us or one of our OEM partners. The software licenses associated with these sales are typically non-portable and can be used over the life of the server on which the software is delivered. Revenue from our non-portable software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. 

Hardware revenue In the infrequent transactions where the hardware platform is purchased directly from Nutanix, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures 
 We regularly monitor total billings, ARR, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, free cash flow, and total end customers, which are non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures, to help us evaluate our growth and operational efficiencies, measure our performance, identify trends in our sales activity and establish our budgets. We evaluate these measures because they: 
 are used by management and our Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our performance and trends, as well as to provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business, particularly as we operate a subscription-based business model; 

are widely used as a measure of financial performance to understand and evaluate companies in our industry; and 

are used by management to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational and compensation plans, as well as to assess our actual performance against our goals.

Table of Contents NUTANIX, INC. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Total billings is a performance measure which we believe provides useful information to our management and investors, as it represents the dollar value under binding purchase orders received and billed during a given period. ARR is a performance measure that we believe provides useful information to our management and investors as it allows us to better track the top-line growth of our subscription business because it takes into account variability in term lengths. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin are performance measures which we believe provide useful information to investors, as they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures, such as stock-based compensation expense, that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. Free cash flow is a performance measure that we believe provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. 
 Total billings, ARR, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States. Total billings, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow are not substitutes for total revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income (loss), operating margin, or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, respectively. There is no GAAP measure that is comparable to ARR, so we have not reconciled ARR numbers included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to any GAAP measure. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 We calculate our non-GAAP financial and key performance measures as follows: 
 Total billings We calculate total billings by taking the change in deferred revenue less the change in unbilled accounts receivable between the start and end of the period and adding that to total revenue recognized in the same period. 
 ARR We calculate ARR as the sum of annual contract value ("ACV") for all subscription contracts in effect as of the end of the period. For the purposes of this calculation, we assume that the contract term begins on the date a contract is booked, unless the terms of such contract prevent us from fulfilling our obligations until a later period, and irrespective of the periods in which we would recognize revenue for such contract. ARR excludes all life-of-device contracts. We define ACV as the total annualized value of a contract, excluding amounts related to professional services and hardware. We calculate the total annualized value for a contract by dividing the total value of the contract by the number of years in the term of such contract. 
 Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP gross margin We calculate non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit divided by total revenue. We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring charges, and costs associated with certain other non-recurring transactions. Our presentation of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses We define non-GAAP operating expenses as total operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring charges, litigation settlement accruals and legal fees related to certain non-ordinary course litigation matters, and costs associated with certain other non-recurring transactions. Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

Table of Contents NUTANIX, INC. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and Non-GAAP operating margin We calculate non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income (loss) divided by total revenue. We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring charges, litigation settlement accruals and legal fees related to certain non-ordinary course litigation matters, and costs associated with certain other non-recurring transactions. Our presentation of non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin should not be construed as implying that our future results will not be affected by any recurring expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items that we exclude from our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Free cash flow We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations after our capital expenditures.	 
 Total end customers We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries, and the total number of end customers may contract due to mergers, acquisitions, or other consolidation among existing end customers.

Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 and the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Investment in Profitable Growth 
 We continue to invest in our growth over the long run, while improving our operating cash flow performance by focusing on creating operational efficiencies throughout our organization, including go-to-market efficiencies, particularly by generating leverage through partnerships. By maintaining this balance, we believe we can sustain profitable growth. 
 36 

Table of Contents NUTANIX, INC. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Investment in Sales and Marketing Our ability to drive top-line growth depends, in large part, on our ability to capitalize on our market opportunity, including our ability to recruit, train and retain sufficient numbers of ramped sales personnel to support our growth. As part of our investment in our growth over the long run, we plan to invest in sales and marketing, including investing in our sales and marketing teams and continuing our focus on opportunities with major accounts, large deals, and commercial accounts, as well as other sales and marketing initiatives to increase our pipeline growth. As we continue to recruit additional sales representatives, it will take time to train and ramp them to full productivity. As a result, we expect that our overall sales and marketing expense will increase in the near term. We estimate, based on past experience, that our average sales team members typically become fully ramped up around the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us, and as our newer employees ramp up, we expect their increased productivity to contribute to our revenue growth. As of October 31, 2024, we considered approximately 74 of our global sales team members to be fully ramped, while the remaining approximately 26 of our global sales team members are in the process of ramping up. As we continue to focus some of our newer and existing sales team members on major accounts and large deals, and as we operate our subscription-based business model, it may take longer, potentially significantly, for these sales team members to become fully productive, and there may also be an impact to the overall productivity of our sales team. As part of our overall efforts to improve our free cash flow performance, we have also proactively taken steps to increase our go-to-market productivity and over time, we intend to reduce our overall sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. These measures include improving the efficiency of our demand generation spend, focusing on lower cost renewals, increasing leverage of our channel partners and OEMs, including supporting new OEMs, and optimizing headcount in geographies based on market opportunities. 
 Investment in Research and Development and Engineering We also intend, in the long term, to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, including our newer subscription-based products, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of technologies and features available through our platform. We continue to invest in our growth by strengthening our core offerings, investing in our solution ecosystem, and taking advantage of emerging opportunities around generative AI and modern applications across hybrid and mutlicloud environments. 
 We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term. 
 Our Subscription-Based Business Model 
 We operate a subscription-based business model to provide our customers with the flexibility to choose their preferred license levels and durations based on their specific business needs. A subscription-based business model means one in which our products, including associated support and entitlement arrangements, are sold with a defined duration. Subscription-based sales consist of subscription term-based licenses and offerings with ongoing performance obligations, including software entitlement and support subscriptions and cloud-based SaaS offerings. Revenue from subscription term-based licenses is generally recognized upfront upon transfer of control to the customer, which happens when we make the software available to the customer. Accordingly, any decline in average contract durations associated with our subscription term-based licenses would negatively impact our top-line results. Revenue from software entitlement and support subscription and cloud-based SaaS offerings is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. Accordingly, any decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one fiscal quarter may not be fully or immediately reflected in our revenue for that fiscal quarter. For additional information on revenue recognition, see Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Market Adoption of Our Products 
 Hybrid and multicloud paradigms, as well as trends in generative AI and modern applications, have affected IT buyer expectations about the simplicity, agility, scalability, portability and pay-as-you-grow economics of IT resources. A key focus of our sales and marketing efforts is creating market awareness about the benefits of our platform. This includes our newer products outside of our core hyperconverged infrastructure offering, both as compared to traditional data center architectures, as well as the public cloud, particularly as we continue to pursue large enterprises and mission critical workloads. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to and speed with which organizations adopt our platform. 
 37 

Table of Contents NUTANIX, INC. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Leveraging Partners 
 We plan to continue to leverage our relationships with our channel and OEM partners and expand our network of cloud and ecosystem partners, all of which help to drive the adoption and sale of our solutions with our end customers. We sell our solutions primarily through our partners, and our solutions primarily run on hardware platforms that our customers often choose to purchase from our channel or OEM partners. We believe that increasing channel leverage, particularly as we expand our focus on opportunities in commercial accounts, by investing in sales enablement and co-marketing with our channel and OEM partners in the long term will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of end customers. Our reliance on manufacturers, including our channel and OEM partners, to produce the hardware platforms on which our software runs exposes us to supply chain delays, which could impair our ability to provide services to end customers in a timely manner. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by our success in leveraging our relationships with our channel and OEM partners and expanding our network of cloud and ecosystem partners. 
 Customer Acquisition, Retention and Expansion 
 Our business and operating results will depend on our ability to obtain new end customers and retain and sell additional solutions to our existing base of end customers. Our ability to obtain new end customers and retain and sell additional solutions to existing customers will in turn depend in part on a number of factors. These factors include our ability to: execute on our business plans, vision, and objectives (including our growth and go-to-market strategies), respond to competitive pressures, effectively maintain existing and future customer relationships, continue to innovate by adding new functionality and improving usability of our solutions in a manner that addresses our end customers needs and requirements, and optimally price our solutions in light of marketplace conditions, our ability to respond to competitive pressures, manage our costs, and anticipate and manage customer demand. Furthermore, our subscription-based business model and product transitions may cause concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over time, and may also result in confusion among new and existing end customers, for example, regarding our pricing models. Such concerns and/or confusion can slow adoption and renewal rates among our current and future customer base. 
 Our end customers typically deploy our technology for a specific workload initially. After a new end customer's initial order, which includes the product and associated software entitlement and support subscription and services, we focus on expanding our footprint by serving more workloads. We also generate recurring revenue from our software entitlement and support subscription renewals, and given our subscription-focused business model, software and support renewals are having an increasing significance for our future revenue streams as existing subscriptions come up for renewal. We view continued purchases and upgrades as critical drivers of our success. As of October 31, 2024, approximately 76 of our end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have made a repeat purchase, which is defined as any purchase activity, including renewals of term-based licenses or software entitlement and support subscription renewals, after the initial purchase. Additionally, end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer have total lifetime orders, including the initial order, in an amount that is more than 8.9x greater, on average, than their initial order. This number increases to approximately 35.4x, on average, for Global 2000 end customers who have been with us for 18 months or longer as of October 31, 2024. These multiples exclude the effect of one end customer who had a very large and irregular purchase pattern that we believe is not representative of the purchase patterns of all of our other end customers. 
 More recently, our sales pipeline has evolved to include a higher mix of larger deal opportunities, which often take longer to close and require more levels of review from the customer's executive team, involve greater competition, and have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. We have also seen a modest elongation of average sales cycles compared to historical levels, which we believe is influenced by the macroeconomic environment and continued increased scrutiny on spend. These trends are expected to drive greater variability in our ability to land new customers and expand sales to existing customers, and our top-line results may be adversely affected.

 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily from the sale of our Nutanix Cloud Platform, sold primarily as subscription term-based licenses, and which can be deployed on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based SaaS offerings, via hosted service or delivered pre-installed on a server that is configured to order. Non-portable software licenses are delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order servers and can be used over the life of the associated server. 
 Our subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can be sold alongside configured-to-order servers. Our subscription term-based licenses typically have a term of one to five years. Our cloud-based SaaS subscriptions have terms extending up to five years. 
 Our customers generally purchase their qualified hardware platforms for deployment of our software from one of our channel partners or OEMs. Our platform typically includes one or more years of support and entitlements, which provides customers with the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Our platform is primarily sold through channel partners and OEMs. Revenue is recognized net of sales tax and withholding tax. 
 Product revenue Product revenue primarily consists of software revenue. A majority of our product revenue is generated from the sale of our Nutanix Cloud Platform. We also sell renewals of previously purchased software licenses and SaaS offerings. Revenue from our software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is typically upon shipment for sales including a server from a partner, upon making the software available to the customer when not sold with a server, or as services are performed with SaaS offerings. In the infrequent transactions where the hardware is purchased directly from Nutanix, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. 
 Support, entitlements and other services revenue We generate our support, entitlements and other services revenue primarily from software entitlement and support subscriptions, which include the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. The majority of our product sales are sold in conjunction with software entitlement and support subscriptions, with terms ranging from one to five years. Occasionally, we also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support contracts ratably over the contractual service period, which typically commences upon transfer of control of the corresponding products to the customer. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue Cost of product revenue consists of costs paid to OEM partners, hardware costs, personnel costs associated with our operations function, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, cloud-based costs associated with our SaaS offerings, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation and amortization, recruiting and information technology costs that are allocated based on headcount. 
 Cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue Cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue includes personnel and operating costs associated with our global customer support organization, as well as allocated costs. We expect our cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our support, entitlements and other services revenue increases. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. 
 39 

Table of Contents NUTANIX, INC. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including sales commissions. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for promotional activities and other marketing costs, travel expenses, costs associated with demonstration units, including depreciation, and allocated costs. Commissions are deferred and recognized as we recognize the associated revenue. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue, in the long term, to increase in absolute dollars as part of our long-term plans to invest in our growth. However, as part of our overall efforts to improve our operating cash flow performance, we have also proactively taken steps to increase our go-to-market productivity and over time, we intend to reduce our overall sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. As we continue to recruit additional sales representatives, it will take time to train and ramp them to full productivity. As a result, our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate. 
 Research and development Research and development ("R D") expense consists primarily of personnel costs, as well as other direct and allocated costs. We have devoted our product development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our solutions. R D costs are expensed as incurred, unless they meet the criteria for capitalization. We expect R D expense, in the long term, to increase in absolute dollars as part of our long-term plans to invest in our future products and services, including our newer subscription-based products, although R D expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue and, on an absolute basis, from quarter to quarter. 
 General and administrative General and administrative ("G A") expense consists primarily of personnel costs, which include our executive, finance, human resources and legal organizations. G A expense also includes outside professional services, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and other consulting costs, as well as insurance and other costs associated with being a public company and allocated costs. We expect G A expense, in the long term, to increase in absolute dollars, particularly due to additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs associated with our growth, although G A expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue and, on an absolute basis, from quarter to quarter. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income and expense, which includes the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with our previously outstanding 2.50 convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes") and our outstanding 0.25 convertible senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"), non-cash interest expense on the 2026 Notes, interest expense related to the conversion of the 2026 Notes in full, the amortization of the debt discount on the 2026 Notes, interest expense on the 2027 Notes, interest income related to our short-term investments, and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes for certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and federal and state income taxes in the United States. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our federal and state net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets. Beginning in fiscal 2023, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 required us to capitalize and amortize R D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization of R D resulted in U.S. taxable income for the fiscal 2025, which was partially offset by net operating loss carryforwards.

The increase in product revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was due primarily to increases in software revenue resulting from an increased adoption of our products, as well as growth in software renewals. Specifically, we saw growth in term-based license revenue, which increased by 27 from the prior year period. For the three months ended October 31, 2023, the total average contract duration was approximately 2.9 years. For the three months ended October 31, 2024, the total average contract duration was approximately 3.1 years. Total average contract duration represents the dollar-weighted term across all subscription contracts, as well as our limited number of life-of-device contracts billed during the period, using an assumed term of five years for licenses without a specified term, such as life-of-device licenses. 
 Support, entitlements and other services revenue increased for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, in conjunction with the growth of our end customer base and the related software entitlement and support subscription contracts and renewals.

 Cost of product revenue decreased for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to decreases in overhead resulting from lower software license and support costs, as well as lower stock-based compensation expense. Slight fluctuations in hardware revenue and cost of product revenue are anticipated, as we expect to continue selling small amounts of hardware for the foreseeable future. 
 Product gross margin increased by 1.3 percentage points for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to product revenue increasing while cost of product revenue decreased.

 Cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue 
 Cost of support, entitlements and other services revenue increased for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to higher outside services and personnel-related costs, resulting from growth in our global customer support organization. 
 Support, entitlements and other services gross margin increased by 1.5 percentage points for the three months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to support, entitlements and other services revenue growing at a higher rate than personnel-related costs.

The increase in the income tax provision for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was due primarily to an increase in our U.S. taxable income and higher foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by excess tax benefits on stock options and restricted stock units. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and net accounts receivable. As of October 31, 2024, we had 716.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, 0.4 million of restricted cash and 358.8 million of short-term investments, which were held for general corporate purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments primarily consist of bank deposits, money market accounts and highly rated debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies and debt instruments of highly rated corporations. As of October 31, 2024, we had accounts receivable of 198.6 million, net of allowances of 0.9 million. 
 In September 2020, we issued 750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50 convertible senior notes due 2026 to BCPE Nucleon (DE) SPV, LP, an entity affiliated with Bain Capital, LP. On June 6, 2024, BCPE Nucleon (DE) SPV, LP delivered a notice of conversion to convert 817.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes, representing all of the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 Notes. During the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024, we settled the conversion by paying 817.6 million in cash and delivering approximately 16.9 million shares of Class A common stock. For additional information, see Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In September 2021, we issued convertible senior notes with a 0.25 interest rate for an aggregate principal amount of 575.0 million due 2027, of which 477.3 million in principal amount was issued in exchange for approximately 416.5 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes and the remaining 97.7 million in principal amount was issued for cash. There are no required principal payments on the 2027 Notes prior to their maturity. For additional information, see Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents NUTANIX, INC. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and our expected net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and share repurchases (if any) for at least the next 12 months. We may, from time to time, evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives (including debt or equity financing) for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. Our future cash needs will depend on many factors, including our growth strategy and plans, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our products, our end customers and partners, and market, economic and financial conditions (including inflation and interest rates). In addition, if the conditional conversion feature of the 2027 Notes is triggered prior to their October 1, 2027 maturity date, holders of the 2027 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2027 Notes at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2027 Notes, we may elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, rather than exclusively in cash. 
 Capital Return 
 In August 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 350.0 million of our Class A common stock. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management s discretion from time to time. The authorization has no fixed expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any specified number or dollar value of shares. The program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. For more information on the share repurchase program, refer to Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 161.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 145.5 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was due primarily to the increase in our net income from operations. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 42.2 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023 included 278.2 million of short-term investment purchases and 13.0 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 249.0 million of maturities of short-term investments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 28.2 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 included 110.0 million of short-term investment purchases and 9.8 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 91.6 million of maturities of short-term investments. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 4.4 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023 included 17.5 million of repurchases of our Class A common stock and 0.6 million of payments for finance lease obligations, partially offset by 13.8 million of proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans.

(3) Purchase obligations and other commitments pertaining to our daily business operations. 

From time to time, in the normal course of business, we make commitments with our contract manufacturers to ensure them a minimum level of financial consideration for their investment in our joint solutions. These commitments are based on revenue targets or on-hand inventory and non-cancelable purchase orders for non-standard components. We record a charge related to these items when we determine that it is probable a loss will be incurred and we are able to estimate the amount of the loss. Our historical charges have not been material. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above, as it is uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Table of Contents 

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We have operations both within the United States and internationally and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries where our operations are located. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments. In the event our foreign sales and expenses increase, our operating results may be more significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can affect our operating income or loss. The effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates on our non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities would not have had a material impact on our historical condensed consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 A hypothetical 10 decrease in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an increase in our operating loss of approximately 15.9 million and 17.5 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase in this hypothetical change is due to an increase in our expenses denominated in foreign currencies. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our investment objective is to conserve capital and maintain liquidity to support our operations; therefore, we generally invest in highly liquid securities, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds. Such fixed and floating interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed income securities may be adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. Therefore, we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by any sudden change in interest rates. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on management s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(1) In August 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 350.0 million of our Class A common stock. We may repurchase shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The timing and amount of share repurchases will depend upon prevailing stock prices, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. The authorization has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to repurchase any minimum number of shares.
