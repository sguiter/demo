On November 18, 2021, the Company entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender (the "Credit Agreement"). The financing consisted of a seven -year 600,000 first lien term loan, a five -year revolving credit facility, and a delayed draw term loan. The proceeds of delayed draw loans made after closing were available to the Company to finance acquisitions. Upon the expiration of the delayed draw term loan in May 2022, the Company had drawn , which is included in the amount outstanding under the first lien term loan due November 17, 2028. Proceeds from the credit facility were used to repay in full the Company s obligations under its previously existing first lien and second lien notes and to pay in deferred financing fees related to the refinancing. 
 
 The revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit facility in the amount of , p ursuant to which letters of credit may be issued as long as revolving loans may be advanced and subject to availability under the revolving credit facility. The Company had in outstanding letters of credit on September 29, 2024 . 
 
 The first lien term loan is to be repaid in quarterly payments of through September 30, 2028 with the balance due upon maturity on November 17, 2028. The Company is required to make annual payments on the term loan in an amount equal to of annual excess cash flow greater than 5,000, as defined in the Credit Agreement. This percentage requirement may decrease or be eliminated if certain leverage ratios are achieved. Based on the Company's results for 2023, no excess cash flow payment is required in 2024. Any such payments offset future mandatory quarterly payments. The Credit Agreement permits voluntary prepayments at any time, in whole or in part. The Company repurchased outstanding principal on its first lien term loan at a discount to par during the 39 -week period ended September 29, 2024 . 
 
 As of September 29, 2024 , amounts outstanding under the credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or base rate, at the Company's election, plus a specified margin. In the case of revolving credit loans and letter of credit fees, the specified margin is based on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement.

On September 29, 2024 , the weighted average interest rate on the Company's borrowings under the credit facility was . 
 
 The Company has entered into an interest rate collar in the notional amount of to hedge the Company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its variable-rate debt. Refer to Note 8, "Derivative Instruments, " for additional information. 
 
 Obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets, including a secured interest in the Company's headquarters, with a carrying value of . The Credit Agreement includes representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including, but not limited to, limitations on restricted payments, additional borrowings, additional investments, and asset sales. 

In February 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, increases the Total Leverage Ratio applicable under the Credit Agreement as of the quarter ending April 2, 2023 to initially 7.25:1.00, and provides for modified step-down levels for such covenant thereafter through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024 the Covenant Relief Period ).

As a condition to the Covenant Relief Period, the Company also agreed to (i) a minimum liquidity test, (ii) an interest coverage test, (iii) an anti-cash hoarding test at any time revolving loans are outstanding, and (iv) additional reporting obligations. Under the amended Credit Agreement, the revolving credit facility contains a minimum liquidity financial covenant of , which includes unrestricted cash and any available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. In April 2023, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement in which the interest rate on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement was changed from LIBOR to SOFR. In May 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement in which certain defined terms were clarified. The Company incurred of deferred financing fees related to these amendments. On September 29, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

Warrants, consisting of public warrants ("Public Warrants") and private warrants ("Private Warrants" and together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants ), outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock that were issued by Empower prior to the Business Combination. Each Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustments, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder. The Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. The Warrants expire on July 16, 2026, the date that is five years after the Closing Date, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Additionally, the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and are exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by Empower Sponsor Holdings, LLC (the "Sponsor") or any of its permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 

The Company may redeem the Public Warrants at a price of per warrant upon 30 days' notice if the closing price of Common Stock equals or exceeds per share, subject to adjustments, on the trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration statement and current prospectus in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such Warrants throughout the 30 -day redemption period. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the Warrants, the Warrant holder is entitled to exercise his, her or its Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. Any such exercise requires the Warrant holder to pay the exercise price for each Warrant being exercised. Further, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants at a price of per warrant upon 30 days' notice if the closing price of Common Stock equals or exceeds per share, subject to adjustments, on the trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given. Beginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the Warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis and receive that number of shares of Common Stock as determined by reference to a table in the warrant agreement. 
 
 During any period when the Company has failed to maintain an effective registration statement, warrant holders may exercise Warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3 (a)( 9 of the Securities Act or another exemption, and the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue-sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 
 
 The Company s Warrants are accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 815 - 40 and are presented as a warrant liability on the balance sheet.

 Additionally, the Sponsor received shares of Common Stock upon the Closing, which vest in two equal tranches upon achievement of certain market share price milestones during the earn-out period, as outlined in the Merger Agreement (the Earn-Out Shares ). The first tranche of Earn-Out Shares vested during the first quarter of 2022. Upon vesting, the first tranche of Earn-Out Shares were issued and a liability of , representing the fair value of the shares on the date of vesting, was reclassified from liabilities to equity. The remaining tranche of Earn-Out Shares will be forfeited if the applicable conditions are not satisfied before July 16, 2028 seven years after the Closing Date). The unvested Earn-Out Shares are presented as an earn-out liability on the balance sheet and are remeasured at fair value with cha nges in fair value recognized as non-operating expense.

As of September 29, 2024 , the Company's derivative liabilities for its Private and Public Warrants, earn-out liability, and derivative asset for its Collar are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (see Note 7, Common Stock Warrants and Earn-Out Liability, and Note 8, " Derivative Instruments ," for more details). The fair values of the Private Warrants and earn-out liability are determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market (Level 3 ). The valuation of the Level 3 liabilities uses assumptions and estimates the Company believes would be made by a market participant in making the same valuation. The Company assesses these assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis as additional data impacting the assumptions and estimates are obtained. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of its Private Warrants and earn-out liability . The fair value of the Collar, which is included in other noncurrent assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, is determined based on models that reflect the contractual terms of the derivative, yield curves, and the credit quality of the counterparties. Inputs are generally observable and do not contain a high level of subjectivity (Level 2 ). The fair value of the Public Warrants is determine d using publicly traded prices (Level 1 ). Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities related to Warrants and the earn-out liability are recognized as non-operating expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of the Collar is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities related to Warrants and the earn-out liability and changes in the fair value of the Collar are recognized in net cash provided by operating activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 The fair value of Private Warrants was estimated as of the measurement date using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: 

Strike price 

Remaining life (in years) 

Expected dividend 

Risk-free interest rate 

Price threshold 

The fair value of the earn-out liability was estimated as of the measurement date using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: 

Expected term (in years) 

Expected volatility 

Risk-free interest rate 

Price hurdle 

As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company has accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses for which the carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value as the rates used approximate the market rates currently available to the Company. Fair value measurements used in the impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets are Level 3 measurements.

The Company s payment terms with customers are customary and vary by customer and geography but typically range from 30 to 365 days. The Company elected the practical expedient to disregard the possible existence of a significant financing component related to payment on contracts, as the Company expects that customers will pay for the products within one year. The Company has evaluated the terms of our arrangements and determined that they do not contain significant financing components. Additionally, as all contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient to exclude disclosure of information regarding the aggregate amount and future timing of performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The Company provides limited warranties on most of its products against certain manufacturing and other defects. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. Refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies for more information.

 Overview 
 
 We are a leading designer, marketer, and manufacturer of high performance automotive aftermarket products serving car and truck enthusiasts, with sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States, Canada, Europe and China. We design, market, manufacture and distribute a diversified line of performance automotive products including fuel injection systems, tuners, exhaust products, carburetors, safety equipment and various other performance automotive products. Our products are designed to enhance street, off-road, recreational and competitive vehicle performance and safety. 
 
 Innovation is at the core of our business and growth strategy. We have a history of developing innovative products, including new products in existing product families, product line expansions, and accessories, as well as products that bring us into new categories. We have thoughtfully expanded our product portfolio over time to adapt to consumer needs. 
 
 In addition, we have historically used strategic acquisitions to (i) expand our brand portfolio, (ii) enter new product categories and consumer segments, (iii) increase direct-to-consumer scale and connection, (iv) expand share in current product categories and (v) realize value-enhancing revenue and cost synergies. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that would complement our current business and expand our addressable target market. 
 
 Factors Affecting our Performance 
 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed above, under the caption, "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under the caption, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024, and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 
 Business Environment 
 
 Our business and results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity are impacted by broad economic conditions, as well as by geopolitical events, including the conflict in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, and the possible expansion of such conflicts and potential geopolitical consequences. Our business is impacted by various economic factors that affect both consumers and the automotive industry, including by not limited to inflation, fuel costs, wage rates, supply chain disruptions, hiring, and other economic conditio ns. In response to inflationary impacts and supply chain disruptions, we have attempted to minimize potential adverse impacts on our business with cost savings initiatives, price increases to customers, and increased attention to maintaining appropriate inventory levels in the distribution channel. Our profitability has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by constrained consumer demand, a shift in sales to lower-margin products, and demands on our performance that increase our costs. Should the ongoing macroeconomic conditions not improve, or worsen, or if our attempt to mitigate the impact on our supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 The principal activity from which we generate sales is the designing, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of performance after-market automotive parts for our end consumers. Sales are displayed net of rebates and sales returns allowances. Sales returns are recorded as a charge against gross sales in the period in which the related sales are recognized.

The difference between the effective tax rate for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2024 and the federal statutory rate in 2024 was due to permanent differences related to changes in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities recognized during the period and the impact of foreign taxes in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the 13-week period ended October 1, 2023 was 73.6 . The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate in 2023 was primarily due to permanent differences resulting from the change in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities.

The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2024, resulted from a 8.3 decrease in product sales and lower freight costs, partially offset by 8.8 million of strategic product rationalization charge that is part of a portfolio transformation aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow-moving stock keeping units ("SKUs"). 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

Gross profit for the 
 39-week period ended September 29, 2024
 decreased 
 21.1 million
 , or

 was 
 37.8 
 as compared to a gross margin of 
 38.9 
 for the 
 39-week period ended October 1, 2023
 . Gross profit margin declined primarily due to a strategic product rationalization charge driven by initiatives, which was partially offset by 
 improvements in freight costs, purchasing price variance, warranty improvements and lower write-downs from E O. After adjusting for the 8.8 million of a strategic product rationalization charge 
 , Adjusted Gross Margin for the year was 
 39.7

The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was driven by a 2 million reserve related to litigation settlements, a 3.0 million increase in wages, and 4.5 million of costs incurred for advisory services related to supporting transformation initiatives. The increase in wages is offset by a reduction in research and development costs due to the Company's realignment of employees' roles and responsibilities from selling, general and administrative to research and development.

 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
 
 For the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024 , we recognized a gain of 7.6 million from the change in fair value of the warrant liability.

The difference between the effective tax rate for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024 and the federal statutory rate in 2024 was due to permanent differences related to changes in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities recognized during the period, federal research and development tax credits, and the impact of foreign taxes in higher tax rate jurisdictions. In addition, the company incurred expenses related to strategic product rationalization charge that were determined to be significant and infrequent in nature, therefore, the full tax benefit of these expenses was recorded during the year as a discrete adjustment. The effective tax rate for the 39-week period ended October 1, 2023 was 30.1 . The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate in 2023 was primarily due to permanent differences resulting from the change in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities.

 As a result of factors described above, we recognized net income of 14.5 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024, as compared to net income of 18.0 million for the 39-week period ended October 1, 2023. Additionally, we recognized total comprehensive income of 14.8 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024, as compared to total comprehensive income of 17.9 million for the 39-week period ended October 1, 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We present certain information with respect to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow as supplemental measures of our operating performance and believe that such non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and in comparing our financial results between periods because they exclude the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the usefulness of our financial information by presenting measures that management uses internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help to depict a more realistic representation of the performance of our underlying business, enabling us to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. 
 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income, gross profit, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other performance measures, as applicable, derived in accordance with GAAP.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We define EBITDA as earnings before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, and income tax expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude, to the extent applicable, restructuring costs, which includes operational restructuring and integration activities, termination related benefits, facilities relocation, and executive transition costs; changes in the fair value of the warrant liability; changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability; equity-based compensation expense; strategic product rationalization charges primarily due to initiatives that are part of a portfolio transformation aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow-moving SKUs; loss on sale of assets; gain or loss on the early extinguishment of debt; notable items that we do not believe are reflective of our underlying operating performance, including litigation settlements and certain costs incurred for advisory services related to identifying performance initiatives; and other expenses or gains, which includes gains or losses from disposal of fixed assets, franchise taxes, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. 
 
 The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

On October 15, 2024, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC s Division of Corporation Finance (the Staff related to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Staff s letter included a comment relating to two of our non-GAAP measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit, seeking an explanation why the adjustment for inventory charges included in each of those measures does not represent costs that are normal operating costs of the business. We are in the process of preparing a response and intend to work with the Staff to address the comment. If the Staff were to object to our continued inclusion of the adjustment for such inventory charges, the Strategic product rationalization charge reported above will be removed from our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit and such measures will decrease accordingly. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS 
 
 We define Adjusted Net Income as earnings excluding the after-tax effect of changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability, and gain or loss on the early extinguishment of debt. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net Income on a per share basis. Management uses these measures to focus on on-going operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. We believe that using this information, along with net income and net income per diluted share, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations. 
 
 The following unaudited tables present the reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Management believes providing Free Cash Flow is useful for investors to understand our performance and results of cash generation after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. 
 
 The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Free Cash Flow for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary cash needs are to support working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt repayments. We have generally financed our historical needs with operating cash flows, capital contributions and borrowings under our credit facilities. These sources of liquidity may be impacted by various factors, including demand for our products, investments made in acquired businesses, plant and equipment and other capital expenditures, and expenditures on general infrastructure and information technology. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, the Company had cash of 50.8 million and availability of 122.8 million under its revolving credit facility. The Company has a senior secu red revolving credit facility with 125 million in borrowing capacity. As of September 29, 2024 , the Company had 2.2 million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In February 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement which, among other things, contains a minimum liquidity financial covenant of 45 million, which includes unrestricted cash and any available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. The amendment also increased the Total Leverage Ratio applicable under the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ending April 2, 2023, to initially 7.25:1.00, and provides for modified step-down levels for such covenant thereafter through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. During the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024 , the Company successfully exited the Covenant Relief Period. 
 
 The Company is obligated under various operating leases for facilities, equipment and automobiles with estimated lease payment s of approximately 1.6 million, inclu ding short term leases, due during the remainder of fiscal year 2024. See Note 14, "Lease Commitments" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to the Company s lease obligations. 
 
 Holley's capital expenditures are primarily related to ongoing maintenance and improvements, including investments related to upgrading and maintaining our information technology systems, tooling for new products, vehicles for product development, and machinery and equipment for operations. We expect capital expenditures in the range of 6 million to 8 million in fiscal year 2024. 
 
 See Note 6, "Debt" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detail of our credit facility and the timing of principal maturities. As of September 29, 2024, based on the then current weighted average interest rate of 9.1 , expected interest payments associated with outstanding debt totaled approximately 13.1 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 As discussed under Business Environment above, although the future impact of supply chain disruptions a nd inflationary pressures are highly uncertain, we believe that cash generated through our current operating performance, and our operating plans, cash position, and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Operating Activities . Net cash provided by operating activities for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024 was 42.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 56.9 million for the 39-week period ended October 1, 2023 . Significant changes in the year-over-year change in working capital activity included negative fluctuations in inventories of 23.4 million . Partially offsetting the decrease was a positive fluctuation from accounts payable of 14.4 million . The change in inventory reflects the impact of fluctuations in sales while changes in accounts payable are impacted by the timing of payments. 
 
 Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities for the 39-week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 were 2.7 million and 3.1 million , respectively, due to capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities . Cash used in financing activities for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024 was 30.3 million , which primarily reflects 28.8 million in principal payments on long-term debt. The principal payments of long-term debt during the 39-week period ended September 29, 2024 include the repurchase of 25.0 million outstanding principal on the first lien term loan. Cash used in financing activities for the 39-week period ended October 1, 2023 was 43.0 million , which primarily reflects principal payments on long-term debt and deferred financing fees. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates, judgements and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, refer to the section entitled Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. For further information see also Note 1, Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk. Holley is exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to the Company s ongoing investing and financing activities. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. Holley has established policies and procedures governing the Company s management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. When appropriate, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk from its interest rate exposure. The Company's interest rate collar is intended to mitigate some of the effects of increases in interest rates. As of September 29, 2024, a total of 564.2 million of term loan and revolver borrowings were subject to variable interest rates, with a weighted average borrowing rate of 9.1 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately 0.6 million increase in annual interest expense, while a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximately 4.1 million decrease to Holley s annual interest expense. 
 
 Credit and other Risks. Holley is exposed to credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. As of September 29, 2024, the majority of the Company s cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash balances in an overnight sweep account where funds are transferred to an interest-bearing deposit account that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The FDIC insures financial institution deposits up to 250 thousand. Holley maintains deposits in certain accounts which exceed the insurance coverage provided on such deposits. The Company does not believe that its cash equivalents present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions. Substantially all trade receivable balances of the business are unsecured. The credit risk with respect to trade receivables is concentrated by the number of significant customers that the Company has in its customer base and a prolonged economic downturn could increase exposure to credit risk on the Company s trade receivables. To manage exposure to such risks, Holley performs ongoing credit evaluations of the Company s customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses. 
 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity. As of September 29, 2024, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While historically this exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates has not had a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations, foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on business and results of operations in the future. Historically, Holley s primary exposure has been related to transactions denominated in the Euro and Canadian dollars. The majority of the Company s sales, both domestically and internationally, are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Historically, the majority of the Company s expenses have also been in U.S. Dollars, and we have been somewhat insulated from currency fluctuations. However, Holley may be exposed to greater exchange rate sensitivity in the future. Currently, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exposure; however, the Company may consider strategies to mitigate foreign currency exposure in the future if deemed necessary. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 29, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
