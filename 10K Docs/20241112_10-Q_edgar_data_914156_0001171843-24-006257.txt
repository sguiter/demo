Less allowance for credit losses 

Receivables, net 

The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. The Company s expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions, and a review of the status of customers' trade accounts receivable. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is based on the aging of the accounts receivable balances and the financial condition of customers. Additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. The Company s monitoring activities include timely account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written-off when determined to be uncollectible. Estimates based on an assessment of anticipated payment and all other historical, current, and future information that is reasonably available are used to determine the allowance. 

The following table provides a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses that is deducted from accounts receivable to present the net amount expected to be collected for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Level 1 

 Valued based on unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 

Level 2 

 Valued based on either directly or indirectly observable prices for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life. 

Level 3 

 Valued based on management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. 

The following table presents the fair value and hierarchy levels, for financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

Present value of non-competition payments 

In connection with the acquisitions of Welch and Marble in 2024, and DAS Medical in 2021, the Company is required to make contingent payments, subject to the entities achieving certain financial performance thresholds. The contingent consideration payments for the Welch, Marble and the DAS Medical acquisitions are up to million, thousand and million, respectively. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payments recognized upon the acquisition as part of the purchase accounting opening balance sheets totaled approximately thousand, thousand and million for the Welch, Marble and the DAS Medical acquisitions, respectively, and was estimated by discounting to present value the probability-weighted contingent payments expected to be made. Assumptions used in the initial calculation were management s financial forecasts, discount rate and various volatility factors. The ultimate settlement of contingent consideration could deviate from current estimates based on the actual results of these financial measures. Contingent consideration is considered to be a Level 3 financial liability that is re-measured each reporting period. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payments recognized at September 30, 2024 totaled approximately million out of the remaining potential payments of million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the acquisitions is included in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Also in connection with the DAS Medical and Advant Medical acquisitions, the Company entered into Non-Competition Agreements with the beneficiaries (certain previous owners of DAS and Advant) and the Company has agreed to pay additional consideration to the parties to the Non-Competition Agreements, including an aggregate of million in payments over the ten years following the closing of the DAS Medical acquisition for the -year noncompetition covenants of certain key owners and an aggregate of thousand in payments over the three years following the third anniversary of the closing of the Advant Medical acquisition for the -year noncompetition covenants of the owner. The Company paid approximately million during the first quarter of 2024 related to non-competition agreements. The present value of the Non-Competition Agreements at September 30, 2024 totaled approximately million. This liability is considered to be a Level 3 financial liability that is re-measured each reporting period. 

The Company has financial instruments, such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, that are stated at carrying amounts that approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value as the interest rate on the debt approximates the estimated borrowing rate currently available to the Company. 

Stock option grants 

Restricted Stock Unit Awards ("RSUs") 

Total share-based compensation 

The total income tax benefit recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for share-based compensa tion arrangements was approximately thousand and million for the three-and-nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately thousand and million for the three-and-nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023.

The compensation expense for common stock granted during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was determined based on the market price of the shares on the date of grant. 

Stock Option Grants 

The following is a summary of stock option activity under all plans for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024: 

Granted 

Exercised 

Outstanding at September 30, 2024

Exercise price 

Expected term 

Weighted-average grant date fair value 

The stock volatility for each grant is determined based on a review of the experience of the weighted average of historical daily price changes of the Company s common stock over the expected option term, and the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods correspond ing with the expected term of the option. The expected term is estimated based on historical option exercise activity. 

During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total intrinsic value of all options exercised (i.e., the difference between the market price and the price paid to exercise the options) was approximately thousand and million, respectively, and the total amount of consideration received by the Company from the exercised options was approximately thousand and thousand, respectively.

The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock options, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock options during the period. These outstanding stock options are not included in the computa tion of diluted income per share because the effect would be antidilutive. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the number of stock awards excluded from the computation were zero and 2,958 , respectively.

Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms we , us , our , or the Company refer to UFP Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Overview 

The Company is a designer and custom manufacturer of comprehensive solutions for medical devices, sterile packaging, and other highly engineered custom products. The Company is an important link in the medical device supply chain and a valued outsource partner to many of the top medical device manufacturers in the world. The Company s single-use and single-patient devices and components are used in a wide range of medical devices and packaging for minimally invasive surgery, infection prevention, surfaces and support, wound care, wearables, orthopedic soft goods, and orthopedic implants. 

The Company s current strategy includes further organic growth and growth through strategic acquisitions. 

The Company completed four strategic acquisitions in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The acquired operations primarily serve the medical market and contributed to an overall 20.7 increase in net sales for this period. Organic sales grew 9.1 , fueled by strong sales in the robotic surgery and infection prevention markets. Net sales relating to our largest customer, Intuitive Surgical SARL, were 30.3 of our net sales in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the four acquisitions largely all in the third quarter, it is anticipated that this concentration will decrease going forward. This increase in sales as well as strong margins and the leverage of relatively fixed SG A costs allowed the Company to generate a 30.5 increase in operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Results of Operations 

Net Sales 

Net sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 44.0 to 145.2 million from sales of 100.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net sales is primarily due to increased sales to customers in the medical market of 52.2 , primarily led by increased sales from the Company s recent acquisitions as well as 7.9 increased organic sales fueled by increases in the robotic surgery and infection prevention markets. 

Net sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 20.7 to 360.4 million from sales of 298.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net sales is primarily due to increased sales to customers in the medical market of 23.7 , primarily led by increased sales from the Company s recent acquisitions as well as 7.1 increased organic sales fueled by increases in the robotic surgery and infection prevention markets. 

Gross Profit 

Gross margin increased to 28.6 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 27.5 for the same period in 2023. As a percentage of sales, material and overhead costs collectively decreased 3.2 while labor costs increased 2.1 . The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the accretive margins from the Company s recent acquisitions as well as increased manufacturing efficiencies and the containment of fixed overhead costs. 

Gross margin increased to 29.0 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 28.8 for the same period in 2023. As a percentage of sales, material costs decreased 1.1 while overhead and labor costs collectively increased 0.8 . The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the accretive margins from the Company s recent acquisitions as well as increased manufacturing efficiencies and the containment of fixed overhead costs. The gross margin increases for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30 were achieved despite the absorption of approximately 1 million in purchase accounting one-time costs. 

25

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses SG A increased approximately 26.6 to 15.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 12.5 million for the same period in 2023, largely due to SG A from the Company s recent acquisitions as well as increased performance-based compensation and professional fees. As a percentage of sales, SG A decreased to 10.9 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 12.4 for the same three-month period in 2023 reflecting the leverage of the sales increase over relatively fixed SG A 

SG A increased approximately 21.5 to 43.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 37.8 million for the same period in 2023, largely due to SG A from the Company s recent acquisitions as well as increased performance-based compensation and professional fees. As a percentage of sales, SG A decreased to 12.1 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 12.7 for the same nine-month period in 2023 reflecting the leverage of the sales increase over relatively fixed SG A. 

Acquisition Costs 

The Company incurred approximately 0.7 million and 1.7 million in costs associated with acquisition related activities which were charged to expense for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively These costs were primarily for legal, due diligence and valuation services and are reflected on the face of the income statement. 

Change in fair value of contingent consideration 

In connection with the acquisitions of Welch and Marble in 2024, and DAS Medical in 2021, the Company is required to make contingent payments, subject to the entities achieving certain financial performance thresholds. The contingent consideration payments for the Welch, Marble and the DAS Medical acquisitions are up to 6 million, 500 thousand and 20 million, respectively. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payments recognized upon the acquisition as part of the purchase accounting opening balance sheets totaled approximately 800 thousand, 400 thousand and 5.2 million for the Welch, Marble and the DAS Medical acquisitions, respectively, and was estimated by discounting to present value the probability-weighted contingent payments expected to be made. Assumptions used in the initial calculation were management s financial forecasts, discount rate and various volatility factors. The ultimate settlement of contingent consideration could deviate from current estimates based on the actual results of these financial measures. Contingent consideration is considered to be a Level 3 financial liability that is re-measured each reporting period. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payments recognized at September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 10.0 million out of the remaining potential payments of 16.5 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the acquisitions for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, resulted in an expense of approximately 0.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively, and is included in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Interest expense, net 

Net interest expense was approximately 3.5 million and 0.9 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net interest expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher debt related to 2024 acquisitions. Interest income was immaterial. 

Net interest expense was approximately 4.7 million and 2.9 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net interest expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher debt related to 2024 acquisitions. Interest income was immaterial. 

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of approximately 22.9 and 17.3 of income before income tax expense, for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the current period as compared to the prior period is largely due to the difference in discrete items during the two periods. 

The Company recorded income tax expense of approximately 21.0 and 20.7 of income before income tax expense, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the current period as compared to the prior period is largely due to the difference in discrete items during the two periods as well as more anticipated US based income in 2024 as a result of the recent acquisitions. 

26

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company generally funds its operating expenses, capital requirements, and growth plan through internally generated cash and bank credit facilities. 

Cash Flows 

Net cash provided by operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 42.2 million and was primarily a result of net income generated of approximately 42.6 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately 10.1 million, share-based compensation of approximately 4.8 million, a change in the fair value of contingent consideration of approximately 0.7 million, a decrease in deferred taxes of approximately 0.8 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of approximately 0.7 million due to the timing of vendor payments in the ordinary course of business. 

These cash inflows and adjustments to income were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately 2.9 million resulting primarily from an increase in sales from the last 60 days of Q3 2024 as compared to Q4 2023, partially offset by the collection of an escrow receivable, an increase in inventory of approximately 5.6 million due to inventory build for upcoming demand, an increase in prepaid expenses of approximately 0.9 million primarily due to the payment of current year insurance policies, an increase in refundable income taxes of 0.8 million due to the timing of payment of tax estimates, an increase in other assets of approximately 0.5 million, a decrease in accrued expenses of approximately 0.6 million due primarily to the net payment of accrued compensation, a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately 0.8 million due to the recognition of deferred tooling and development revenue, and a decrease in other long-term liabilities of approximately 5.4 million due primarily to non-compete payments and payments of contingent consideration. 

Net cash used in investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 206.3 million and was primarily the result of the acquisition of Marble Medical, AJR Enterprises, Welch Fluorocarbon, and AQF Medical, and the additions of manufacturing machinery and equipment and various building improvements across the Company. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 175.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily the result of borrowings under the Company s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement of approximately 240.2 million to recent acquisitions. These borrowings were partially offset by payments on the revolving line of credit of approximately 28.2 million, principal payments of long-term debt of approximately 32.0 million, payments of contingent consideration of approximately 0.2 million and payments of statutory withholding for stock options exercised and restricted stock units vested of approximately 4.7 million. 

Outstanding and Available Debt 

On June 27, 2024, the Company, as the borrower, entered into a secured 275 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with certain of the Company s subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors and Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as the initial lender, Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and L/C Issuer, and certain other lenders from time-to-time party thereto. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company s prior credit agreement, originally dated as of December 22, 2021. 

The credit facilities under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement consist of a secured term loan to the Company of 125 million and a secured revolving credit facility, under which the Company may borrow up to 150 million. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Facilities mature on June 27, 2029. This maturity date is subject to acceleration and the Company could be subject to additional fees and expenses in certain circumstances should one or more events of default described in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement occur. The secured term loan requires quarterly principal payments of 3,125,000 that commence on December 31, 2024. The proceeds of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including funding the acquisition of AJR Enterprises, LLC, as well as certain other permitted acquisitions. The Company s obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Subsidiary Guarantors and secured by substantially all assets of the Company. 

27

The Third Amended and Restated Credit Facilities call for interest of SOFR plus a margin that ranges from 1.25 to 2.25 or, at the discretion of the Company, the bank s prime rate plus a margin that ranges from .25 to 1.25 . In both cases the applicable margin is dependent upon Company performance. Under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to a minimum fixed-charge coverage financial covenant as well as a maximum total funded debt to EBITDA financial covenant. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains other covenants customary for transactions of this type, including restrictions on certain payments, permitted indebtedness and permitted investments. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 212 million in outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and also had approximately 0.7 million in standby letters of credit outstanding, drawable as a financial guarantee on worker s compensation insurance policies. At September 30, 2024, the applicable interest rate was approximately 6.5 and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Future Liquidity 

The Company requires cash to pay its operating expenses, purchase capital equipment, and to service its contractual obligations. The Company s principal sources of funds are its operations and its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company generated cash of approximately 42.2 million from operations during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The Company cannot guarantee that its operations will generate cash in future periods. The Company s longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and availability of draws on its revolving credit facility. Further, the economic uncertainty resulting from events including inflation, bank failures, and other factors beyond the control of the Company could affect the Company s long-term ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue operations. 

The Company plans to continue to add capacity to enhance operating efficiencies in its manufacturing plants and accommodate anticipated growth in demand. The Company may consider additional acquisitions of companies, technologies, or products that are complementary to its business. The Company believes that its existing resources, including its revolving credit facility, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements, including capital asset acquisitions, through the next twelve months. 

28

The Company may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other investments. These capital requirements could be substantial. The Company anticipates that any future expansion of its business will be financed through existing resources, cash flow from operations, the Company's revolving credit facility, or other new financing. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to meet existing financial covenants or obtain other new financing on favorable terms, if at all. The Company's liquidity will be impacted to the extent additional stock repurchases are made under the Company's stock repurchase program. 

Stock Repurchase Program 

The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method, using the first-in, first-out cost flow assumption, and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders equity. On June 16, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock. Under the program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through Rule 10b5-1 plans, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stock repurchase program will end upon the earlier of the date on which the plan is terminated by the Board or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the program. There were no share repurchases during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. At September 30, 2024, approximately 9.4 million was available for future repurchases of the Company s common stock under this authorization. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

There have been no material changes to the Company s Critical Accounting Estimates, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the exception of the item noted below: 

The Company believes the following critical accounting policy necessitates that significant judgments and estimates be used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 

The Company has reviewed this policy with its Audit Committee. 

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liability 

We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to pay in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, discount rates, useful life or probability of achieving clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and recognized amortization expense and contingent consideration expense or benefit in current and future periods. 

Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations and commitments, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

There have been no material changes in our market risks as previously disclosed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ), the Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company closed the acquisition of Marble in June 2024 and closed on the acquisitions of AJR, Welch and AQF all in the third quarter of 2024. The new acquisitions total assets and revenues constituted approximately 33.9 and 10 , respectively, of the Company s consolidated total assets and year-to-date revenues as shown on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024. As the acquisitions occurred in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2024, the Company excluded all of the acquired businesses internal control over financial reporting from the scope of the assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope within the first year of acquisition if specified conditions are satisfied. 

29

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Except as described above, that evaluation did not identify any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our latest fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company is not a party to any material litigation or other material legal proceedings. From time to time, the Company may be a party to various suits, claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management of the Company, these suits, claims and complaints should not result in final judgments or settlements that, in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS 

The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our other public filings with the SEC including Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.
