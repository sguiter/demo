 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Revenues and gross profit Net revenues decreased 4.8 million or 6.7 to 66.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 71.3 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to a decrease in aerial platform and chassis sales partially offset by an increase in rental revenue. 
 
 28 

Gross profit decreased 0.6 million to 16.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.6 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in gross profit in 2024 is attributable to lower sales, offset by lower material costs driven by supply chain initiatives and increased contribution from the rental segment. As a result of these factors, the gross margin percentage was 24.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 23.3 for the prior year. 
 
 Research and development Research and development expense was 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.9 million for the same period in 2023. The Comp28any s research and development spending reflects our continued commitment to develop and introduce new products that gives the Company a competitive advantage, with the costs generated particularly in the PM and Valla business units. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense SG A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 9.9 million compared to 10.5 million for the comparable period in 2023. SG A expense decreased by 0.7 million due to lower stock compensation, salary expenses and insurance in 2024. 
 
 Transaction costs Transaction costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.0 million, related to professional fees and other costs incurred during the period related to due diligence and other costs of the proposed Merger. 
 
 Interest expense, net Interest expense was 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 1.9 million for the comparable period in 2023 . The increase is driven by higher utilization of working capital facilities. 
 
 Foreign currency transaction losses For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had foreign currency losses of 0.8 million, compared with a loss of 0.9 million for the comparable period in 2023. A substantial portion of the loss relates to changes in the Argentinean peso. 
 
 Other income (expense) Other income was less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with other income of 0.2 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Income taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 0.9 million, which includes a discrete income tax expense of less than 0.1 million. The calculation of the overall income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consists of domestic and foreign income taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 0.7 million, which includes a discrete income tax expense of less than 0.1 million. The calculation of the overall income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consists of U.S. federal income taxes for Rabern which is a separate taxpayer for U.S. federal tax purposes, foreign income taxes, and a discrete tax income tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for a foreign jurisdiction offset by an accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was an income tax provision of 53.7 on pretax income of 1.6 million compared to an income tax provision of 28.1 on pretax income of 2.6 million in the comparable prior period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to income taxed in domestic and foreign jurisdictions at varying tax rates, permanent differences including nondeductible expenses, foreign tax credits, a change to the deferred tax liability related to an investment in a subsidiary, and a partial valuation allowance in the U.S. and Italy as well as a valuation allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Revenues and gross profit - Net revenues increased 3.4 million or 1.6 to 216.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 212.7 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in revenue is primarily due to increased manufacturing throughput in North America, a modest increase in rental revenues, partially offset by a decline in aerial platform and chassis sales. 
 
 Gross profit increased 4.1 million to 50.1 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 45.9 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in gross profit in 2024 is attributable to increased manufacturing throughout, lower material costs driven by supply chain initiatives and increased contribution from the rental segment. As a result of these factors, the gross margin percentage was 23.2 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 21.6 for the prior year. 
 
 Research and development Research and development expense was 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consistent with 2.5 million for the same period in 2023. The Company s research and development spending reflects our continued commitment to develop and introduce new products which gives the Company a competitive advantage. The costs are primarily generated in the PM and Valla business units. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense SG A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 32.1 million compared to 32.3 million for the comparable period in 2023 . SG A expense included an increase in salary expense and property tax offset by a decrease in trade show and stock compensation expenses compared with 2023. 
 
 Transaction costs Transaction costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.0 million, related to professional fees and other costs incurred during the period related to due diligence and other costs relating to the proposed Merger. 
 
 Interest expense, net Interest expense was 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 5.5 million for the comparable period in 2023 as the increase is driven by higher utilization of working capital facilities. 
 
 Foreign currency transaction losses For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a foreign currency loss of 1.6 million, consistent with a loss of 1.7 million for the comparable period in 2023 . A substantial portion of the loss relates to changes in the Argentinean peso. 
 
 Other income Other income was less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with other expense of 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. The expense in 2023 relates to a pension settlement obligation of 0.5 million related to the termination of services provided by union members and 0.2 million of legal settlement charges. 
 
 Income taxes For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 2.3 million, which includes a discrete income tax benefit of 0.4 million. The calculation of the overall income tax provision for the nine months ended 
 30 

September 30, 2024, primarily consists of domestic and foreign taxes offset by a discrete income tax benefit for a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various state and foreign jurisdictions and the settlement of a foreign income tax audit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 0.9 million, which includes a discrete income tax benefit of less than 0.1 million. The calculation of the overall income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consists of U.S. federal income taxes for Rabern which is a separate taxpayer for U.S. federal tax purposes, foreign income taxes, and a discrete income tax benefit related to the expiration of the statutes of limitations for various states and a foreign jurisdiction offset by an accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an income tax provision of 31.9 on pretax income of 7.2 million compared to an income tax provision of 28.6 on pretax income of 3.4 million in the comparable prior period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to income taxed in domestic and foreign jurisdictions at varying tax rates, permanent differences including nondeductible expenses, foreign tax credits, a change to the deferred tax liability related to an investment in a subsidiary, a partial valuation allowance in the U.S. and Italy as well as a valuation allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions, and a discrete income tax benefit for a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various state and foreign jurisdictions, and the settlement of a foreign income tax audit. 

Cash flows for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Operating Activities - For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flow provided by operating activities was 9.2 million compared to 0.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Cash used by working capital was 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used by working capital of 14.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Cash used by working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to decreases in accounts payable, an increase in inventories offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. 
 
 Investing Activities - Cash used in investing activities was 7.2 million for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.3 million used in investing activities in the same period a year ago. Cash used in investing activities was primarily related to cash payments for property and equipment purchases to support the rental business partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets. 
 
 Financing Activities - Cash used in financing activities was 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which included a net reduction in working capital facilities of 1.6 million, a 1.5 million reduction in revolving credit and note payments of 3.5 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The global economy generally and our customers and suppliers specifically are being significantly impacted by a number of factors, including inflation, high interest rates and general economic uncertainty. While the potential negative financial impact that these factors will have on our results of operations and liquidity position cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, such impacts could be material. In the context of these uncertain conditions, we are actively managing the business to maintain cash flow and ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for a variety of scenarios. We believe that such strategy will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements. 
 
 On April 11, 2022, the Company entered into an 85 million credit facility with Amarillo National Bank consisting of a working capital facility of 40 million secured by assets of Manitex U.S. businesses, working capital facility of 30 million secured by assets of Rabern, and 15 million term loan facility. This new banking facility provided the funds for the Rabern acquisition and working capital facilities for both the Manitex U.S. and Rabern businesses. At September 30, 2024, the PM Group had established working capital facilities with five Italian, one Spanish, twelve South American banks and one Romanian bank. Under these facilities, the PM Group can borrow 25 million against orders, invoices and bank overdrafts. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were 4.5 million and 9.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had global liquidity of approximately 30 million based on the cash balance and availability under its working capital facilities. Future advances are dependent on having available collateral. 
 
 If our revenues were to increase significantly in the future, the provision limiting borrowing against accounts receivable and inventory would limit future borrowings. If this were to occur, we would attempt to negotiate higher inventory caps with our banks. There is, however, no assurance that the banks would agree to increase the caps. 
 31 

The Company expects cash flows from operations and existing availability under the current revolving credit and working capital facilities will be adequate to fund future operations. If, in the future, we were to determine that additional funding is necessary, we believe that it would be available. There is, however, no assurance that such financing will be available or, if available, on acceptable terms. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no customer accounted for 10 or more of the Company s accounts receivable. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company s critical accounting policies have not materially changed since the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was filed. See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the Company s critical accounting policies. 
 Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disc losures about Market Risk 
 Not required for Smaller Reporting Companies. 
 Item 4 Contr ols and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) and under the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective and provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). During the period covered by this report, the Company made no changes that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 Legal Proceedings 
 The information set forth in Note 16 (Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies) to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A Ri sk Factors 
 
 You should carefully consider the risks described under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as the Company s other public filings with the SEC, before deciding to invest in the Company s common stock. The occurrence of any of the events described herein or therein could harm the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. In such an event, the market price of the Company s common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the following risks are related to the proposed Merger: 
 
 We may fail to consummate the Merger, and uncertainties related to the consummation of the Merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 The Merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions beyond our control, including receiving the requisite shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions. Failure to satisfy the conditions to the Merger could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger. Further, regulators may impose conditions, obligations or restrictions on the Merger that may have the effect of delaying or preventing its completion. If the Merger does not close, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price, and our shareholders would be exposed to additional risks, including, but not limited to: 
 
 	to the extent that the current trading price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed, the trading price of our common stock could decrease; 
 	investor confidence in us could decline, shareholder litigation could be brought against us, relationships with existing and prospective customers, service providers, investors, lenders and other business partners may be adversely impacted, we may be unable to retain key personnel; 
 	we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses for professional services in connection with the Merger for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not consummated; 
 	any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including adverse changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Merger is not consummated or is significantly delayed; and 
 	the requirement that we pay a termination fee to Tadano under certain circumstances. 
 
 There also is no assurance that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will occur on the terms and timeline currently contemplated or at all. 
 
 If the proposed Merger is delayed or not completed, the trading price of our common stock may decline, including to the extent that the current trading price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated without further delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger. 
 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Tadano. These costs could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for other uses. 
 
 If the Merger is not completed, in certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee to Tadano of 4.9 million. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the termination fee we may be required to pay, if any, under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes or other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 While the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to certain interim covenants, which may disrupt our plans and operations. 
 33 

The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions, including as required by applicable law, pending consummation of the Merger, and subjects us to customary interim operating covenants that restrict us from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Merger and may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Uncertainties relating to the Merger could impact our relationships with customers, employees and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Uncertainty about the pendency of the Merger and the effect of the Merger on employees, customers and other third parties who deal with us may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel pending the consummation of the Merger, as such personnel may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation of the Merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers and other third parties who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us or fail to extend an existing relationship with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and trading price of our common stock. 
 
 The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us for greater consideration than what Tadano has agreed to pay pursuant to the Merger Agreement. 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell our business to a party other than Tadano. Under the Merger Agreement, we became subject to customary no-shop restrictions on our ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding any alternative acquisition proposals, subject to a customary fiduciary out provision. These restrictions, including the added expense of the termination fees that may become payable by us in certain circumstances, might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing that acquisition. 
 
 If the Merger is consummated, our shareholders, other than affiliates of Tadano, will not be able to participate in any further upside to our business. 
 
 If the Merger is consummated, our shareholders will receive 5.80 in cash per share of common stock owned by them without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding, other than shares owned by the Company, Tadano and Merger Sub, and other than affiliates of Tadano, our shareholders will not receive any equity interests of Tadano. As a result, if our business following the Merger performs well, our current shareholders will not receive any additional consideration for their shares of common stock and, other than affiliates of Tadano, will not receive any benefit from any future performance of our business following the Merger. 
 Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 The Company s Credit Agreement with Amarillo National Bank ("Amarillo") directly restricts the Company s ability to declare or pay dividends without Amarillo s consent. In addition, pursuant to the Company s Credit Agreement with Amarillo, the Company s U.S. 
 34 

subsidiaries must maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00 and a net worth for U.S. entities of at least 80 million, each as measured on the last date of each calendar year, beginning June 30, 2022.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are referred to herein individually as a Party and collectively as the Parties .
