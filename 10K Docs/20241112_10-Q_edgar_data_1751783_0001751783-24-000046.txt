 reportable segment, ASU 2023-07 does not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require greater disaggregation of income tax disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The ASU indicates that all entities will apply its guidance prospectively with an option for retroactive application to each period in the financial statements. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and for interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, with an allowance for early adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU but does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 ) ) U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities-residential ) ) U.S. government agency securities ) ) Municipal securities ) ) ) Corporate bonds ) ) Other ) ) Total ) ) ) At September 30, 2024, the Company had individual available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position with unrealized losses totaling with an aggregate depreciation of from the Company s amortized cost. The Company evaluates securities in an unrealized loss position for impairment related to credit losses on at least a quarterly basis. Securities in unrealized loss positions are first assessed as to whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If one of the criteria is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through current earnings. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on asset-backed securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate bonds have not been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality, we do not intend to sell and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities was recorded as of September 30, 2024. Federal agency obligations, residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities and commercial mortgage-backed pass-through securities are issued by U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Although a government guarantee exists on these investments, these entities are not legally backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. Nonetheless, at this time we do not foresee any set of circumstances in which the government would not fund its commitments on these investments.

There were gross gains realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable, because a timely write-off policy exists. A security is placed on non-accrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become more than 90 days delinquent or if full collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. Accrued interest for a security placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. There were securities on non-accrual status and therefore there was accrued interest related to securities reversed against interest income for the periods ended September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Total accrued interest receivable on available for sale securities totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition of this Form 10-Q.

 Critical Accounting Policies Our most significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates, which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates. The judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience, future forecasts, and/or other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We consider the allowance for credit losses to be our most critical accounting policy. Allowance for Credit Losses The Company's allowance for credit losses is its estimate of credit losses currently expected in the loan portfolio, on unfunded lending commitments, and in its available-for-sale securities portfolio over the expected life of those assets. While these estimates are based on substantive methods for determining the required allowance, actual outcomes may differ significantly from estimated results, especially when determining required allowances for larger, complex commercial credits or unfunded lending commitments to commercial borrowers. Consumer loans, including indirect automobile loans and single family residential real estate, are smaller and generally behave in a similar manner, and loss estimates for these credits are considered more predictable. Additionally, the Company estimates the allowance for credit losses as a calculation of expected lifetime credit losses utilizing a forward-looking forecast of macroeconomic conditions, which may differ significantly from actual results. Further discussion of the methodology used in establishing the allowance is provided in Note 3 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q and in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, 2024. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Total Assets. Total assets were 1.27 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.31 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 47.1 million, or 3.6 . Loans receivable decreased by 44.0 million, or 4.4 , available for sale securities decreased 22.9 million, or 11.9 , premises and equipment decreased 3.5 million, or 20.0 , Federal Home Loan Bank stock decreased 3.0 million, or 46.1 , and deferred tax assets decreased 2.1 million, or 21.1 . The decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash of 24.3 million, or 109.6 . Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 24.3 million, or 109.6 , to 46.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 22.1 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in deposits held at the FHLB, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other interest-bearing depository accounts with proceeds resulting from principal payments from loans and security sales. Investment Securities Available for Sale. Available for sale securities decreased 22.9 million, or 11.9 , due to the balance sheet restructuring, which resulted in sales of 70.6 million of lower-yielding securities, and paydowns, calls and maturities of 27.3 million, partially offset by purchases in higher-yielding securities of 56.7 million and a decrease in unrealized loss on available for sale securities of 18.4 million. The restructuring decreased the average life of the securities portfolio, and improved the Company s earnings stream going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. The securities sold had a yield of 1.11 and a weighted average life of approximately 5.8 years. The proceeds were reinvested into assets yielding 4.22 with an approximate weighted average life of 2.7 years. Net Loans. Total net loans receivable were 964.9 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 44.0 million, or 4.4 , as compared to 1.01 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in indirect automobile loans of 75.3 million, or 19.1 , reflecting a strategic decision to decrease that loan portfolio as a percentage of our balance sheet. At September 30, 2024, indirect automobile loans were 25.2 of assets, compared to 30.0 at December 31, 2023. Partially offsetting the decreases in automobile loans were increases in commercial real estate loans of 27.0 million, or 6.3 , and residential real estate loans of 8.3 million, or 10.8 . Non-accrual loans increased by 511,000, or 12.2 , between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock . FHLB stock decreased 3.0 million, or 46.1 , to 3.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 6.5 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a reduction in mandatory ownership of FHLB stock in connection with the pay-off of 68.3 million in advances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Premises and Equipment. Premises and equipment decreased 3.5 million, or 20.0 , to 14.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 17.6 million at December 31, 2023 as the Bank s Beacon branch office was sold in February of 2024 for 2.9 million.

Total liabilities decreased 56.0 million, or 4.7 , to 1.14 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.20 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decreases in Federal Home Loan Bank advances of 68.3 million and mortgagors escrow accounts of 5.7 million.

The continued growth in interest-bearing time deposits was primarily due a shift in deposits from lower-yielding transaction accounts to higher-yielding time deposits and money market accounts as customers sought higher interest rates.

This allows us to maintain deposits that might otherwise be uninsured. Our reciprocal deposits obtained through the CDARS and ICS networks totaled 42.9 million and 40.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had no brokered deposits at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Mortgagors escrow accounts. Mortgagors escrow accounts decreased 5.7 million, or 61.7 , from 9.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 3.6 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due to the timing of tax disbursements. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased 68.3 million, or 53.3 , from 128.1 million at December 31, 2023 to 59.8 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due the use of proceeds from the sales of securities and a reduction in the origination of indirect automobile loans to pay down the debt. Stockholders Equity. Stockholders' equity increased 9.0 million, or 7.9 , to 122.7 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a 14.8 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily reflecting efforts of the balance sheet restructuring as well as the 50 basis point decrease in market interest rates, which was partially offset by a net loss of 5.6 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company s book value per share was 11.06 and the Company s ratio of stockholders equity-to-total assets was 9.69 . At December 31, 2023, the Company s book value per share was 10.27 and the Company s ratio of stockholders equity-to-total assets was 8.66 . Unearned common stock held by the Bank s employee stock ownership plan was 3.1 million and 3.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 465,000, or 7.9 , from 5.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to 6.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 38 basis points to 2.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, due to the current interest rate environment and a greater proportion of deposits consisting of higher-yielding certificates of deposit. The average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 57.2 million, or 6.1 , to 876.9 million primarily due to a decrease of 73.2 million, or 13.9 , in the average balance of our core interest-bearing deposits (consisting of savings, NOW and money market accounts) as depositors sought higher yields in the increasing interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase of 53.0 million, or 18.2 , in the average balance of certificates of deposit. Between the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the average cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased by 55 basis points and the average balance also decreased by 36.1 million. Interest expense increased 3.5 million, or 21.3 , from 16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 59 basis points to 2.92 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to the current interest rate environment and a greater proportion of deposits consisting of higher-rate certificates of deposit, while the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 27.7 million, or 3.0 , to 903.5 million. Between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the average cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased by 9 basis points, while the average balance increased by 5.6 million. A decrease of 98.1 million, or 17.8 , in the average balance of core interest-bearing deposits (consisting of savings, NOW and money market accounts) was partially offset by an increase of 64.5 million, or 23.5 , in the average balance of certificates of deposit as depositors sought higher yields in the increasing interest rate environment. Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses decreased by 21,000, or 2.3 , from 910,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 889,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses decreased by 53,000, or 3.6 , from 1.47 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.42 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases to the provision for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to a decrease in loan balances, primarily indirect automobile loans. Net charge-offs decreased 41,000 from 385,000 for the third quarter of 2023 to 344,000 for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreased net charge-offs in indirect automobile loans of 216,000 and recoveries in residential real estate and commercial loans in the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs increased 8,000, or 0.6 , to 1.4 million for the first nine months of 2024. The percentage of overdue account balances to total loans decreased to 1.62 as of September 30, 2024, from 1.90 as of December 31, 2023, while non-performing assets increased 486,000, or 11.6 , to 4.7 million at September 30, 2024. Non-Interest (Loss) Income. Non-interest loss totaled 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 11.7 million, from non-interest income of 1.6 million for the comparable period in 2023, due primarily to the 12.0 million loss on sale of investment securities resulting from the previously mentioned balance sheet restructuring. Excluding the securities loss, non-interest income for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 would have been 2.0 million compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded an increase of 54,000, or 16.8 , in investment advisory income resulting from the improved market and economic conditions, an increase of 194,000 related to gains on life insurance, an increase of 35,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, an increase of 22,000 in the cash surrender value of life insurance, and an increase in the gain on sales of loans of 20,000.

 Non-interest loss totaled 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 11.4 million, from non-interest income of 4.4 million for the comparable period in 2023, due primarily to the 12.0 million loss on sale of investment securities resulting from the previously mentioned balance sheet restructuring. Excluding the securities loss, non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 5.0 million compared to 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded an increase of 270,000, or 31.3 , in investment advisory income resulting from the improved market and economic conditions, an increase of 194,000 related to gains on life insurance, an increase of 88,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, an increase of 70,000, or 14.2 , in the cash surrender value of life insurance, and an increase in the gain on sales of loans of 39,000, partially offset by a decrease of 54,000 on the disposal of premises and equipment. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense totaled 9.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 266,000, or 3.0 , over the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 370,000 increase in salaries and benefits related primarily due to higher production commissions and higher medical insurance costs. This increase was partially offset by a 109,000 decrease in other non-interest expense primarily due to a decrease in lending operations expense. Non-interest expense totaled 26.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 402,000, or 1.5 , over the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 229,000, or 4.7 , decrease in other non-interest expense, primarily due to decreased retail banking and lending expenses. FDIC deposit insurance and other insurance decreased 121,000, or 13.1 , primarily due to a decreased assessment rate while professional fees decreased 90,000, or 6.1 . Occupancy expense decreased 66,000, or 2.1 , due to a branch closure in the first quarter of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by an 82,000 increase in salaries and benefits and a 42,000 increase in data processing costs. Income Taxes. The income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 2.2 million at a negative effective tax rate of 21.72 , compared to a provision of 343,000 at an effective tax rate of 21.72 in the prior year s comparable quarter. The decrease in the p rovision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 reflected a lower pre-tax income when compared to the prior year s comparable quarter and a tax benefit resulting from a 12.0 million pre-tax loss on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities. The income tax benefit for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 1.6 million at a negative effective tax rate of 21.50 , compared to a provision of 958,000 at an effective tax rate of 21.66 for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the first half of 2024, as compared to the same period a year ago, was primarily due to the pre-tax loss on the sale of investment securities as previously mentioned.

 Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the period indicated (in thousands). The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the rate and volume columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. The Company did not have any excludable out-of-period items or adjustments.

The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans and securities, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, the Board of Directors maintains a management-level Asset/Liability Management Committee (the ALCO ), which takes primary responsibility for reviewing the Company s asset/liability management process and related procedures, establishing and monitoring reporting systems and ascertaining that established asset/liability strategies are being maintained. On at least a quarterly basis, the ALCO reviews and reports to the Board asset/liability management outcomes from various modeling scenarios. The ALCO also implements any changes in strategies and reviews the performance of any specific asset/liability management actions that have been implemented. We manage our interest rate risk to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: originating loans with adjustable interest rates or with shorter terms, promoting core deposit products, and adjusting the interest rates and maturities of funding sources, as necessary. By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to changes in market interest rates.

 Net Economic Value Simulation. We analyze the Bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net economic value of equity EVE model. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio represents the dollar amount of our EVE divided by the present value of our total assets for a given interest rate scenario. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology while the EVE ratio reflects that value as a form of capital ratio. We estimate what our EVE would be at a specific date. We then forecast what the EVE might be at the same date throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. We currently calculate the EVE under scenarios where interest rates increase 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points from current market rates and where interest rates decrease 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points from current market rates. The following table presents the estimated changes in the Bank s EVE that would result from changes in market interest rates at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). 

Net Economic Value as a Net Economic Value Percentage of Assets Dollar Dollar Percent EVE Percent Basis Point Change in Interest Rates Amount Change Change Ratio Change (Dollars in thousands) 400 120,686 (34,375) (22.2) 10.44 (15.8) 300 128,815 (26,246) (16.9) 10.94 (11.8) 200 137,531 (17,530) (11.3) 11.45 (7.6) 100 146,274 (8,787) (5.7) 11.94 (3.7) 0 155,061 12.40 (100) 153,144 (1,917) (1.2) 12.00 (3.2) (200) 145,555 (9,506) (6.1) 11.19 (9.7) (300) 129,955 (25,106) (16.2) 9.81 (20.9) (400) 113,223 (41,838) (27.0) 8.36 (32.6) Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The above table assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our EVE and will likely differ from actual results. Liquidity Management We maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, loan sales, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities, sales and calls of investment securities and other short-term investments, earnings, funds provided from operations, as well as access to FHLB advances and other borrowings. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan and security sales and prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits.

 As reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash flows are classified for financial reporting purposes as operating, investing, or financing cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts differ from our net income because of a variety of cash receipts and disbursements that did not affect net income for the respective periods. Net cash provided by investing activities was 77.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, principally reflecting our investment security and loan activities in the respective periods. A cash inflow of 42.1 million for a decrease in loans was the primary contributor to the cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as opposed to a cash outflow of 11.6 million for an increase in loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Deposit and borrowing cash flows have traditionally comprised most of our financing activities, which resulted in a net cash outflow of 58.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a paydown of debt, compared to a net cash outflow of 24.1 million in the comparable 2023 period caused by an increase in debt offset by a decrease in deposits. At September 30, 2024, we had the following main sources of availability of liquid funds and borrowings: 

(In thousands) Total Available liquid funds: Cash and cash equivalents 46,380 Unencumbered securities 90,614 Availability of borrowings: Zions Bank line of credit 10,000 Pacific Coast Bankers Bank line of credit 50,000 FHLB secured line of credit 215,167 FRB secured line of credit 234,647 Total available sources of funds 646,808 The Bank has access to a preapproved secured line of credit with the FHLB which totaled 633,017 at September 30, 2024. Additional funds available under this line are not included in the table above as we do not consider it to be as readily accessible as the funds above. We also have commitments and obligations under our off-balance sheet financial instruments, post-retirement plan and other benefit plans as described in Note 7 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.
