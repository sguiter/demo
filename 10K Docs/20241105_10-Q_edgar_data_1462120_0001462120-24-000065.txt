 reportable operating segments: Banking and Fintech, as discussed more fully in Note 11. Segments. 
 Changes in Accounting Estimates 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company made enhancements to the qualitative framework of the allowance for credit losses. The enhanced framework leverages quantifiable credit risk metrics as well as current and forecasted economic conditions to determine possible portfolio outcomes that are not captured in quantitatively modeled results. The framework continues to consider risk factors which include, but are not limited to, changes in lending policies, economic and business conditions, nature and volume of portfolio, volume and severity of past due loans, value of underlying collateral, concentrations, and prepayment speeds. The result of these changes was not material. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company changed the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of servicing rights and loans measured at fair value as a result of rising interest rates and their impacts on market conditions. The changes included aligning our net servicing income and loan fair value estimates with changes in forward interest rate curves. Loan fair value estimates were also revised to utilize market participant credit loss information. These revisions provide estimates that the Company believes are more representative of fair value while transitioning from unobservable inputs to those that are more observable. These estimate changes were implemented as of July 1, 2023 and resulted in nonrecurring adjustments to increase the estimated value of the servicing asset by million and loans measured at fair value by million. This adjustment also increased noninterest income by a corresponding million. 
 These refinements have been accounted for as changes in accounting estimates under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , with prospective application beginning in the period of change. 
 Long-Lived Asset Reclassified to Held for Sale 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company sold an aircraft that was previously reclassified as held for sale. The million gain on the sale of the aircraft is reflected in other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

 million. Accordingly, the million carrying amount of the building and land, was considered held for sale, and reclassified from premises and equipment, net to other assets in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the third quarter of 2024, the building and land were sold for a gain of million.

 mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agencies and municipal bonds in unrealized loss positions for greater than 12 months. There were mortgage-backed securities in unrealized loss positions for less than 12 months. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2023 were comprised of mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agencies and municipal bonds in unrealized loss positions for greater than 12 months and mortgage-backed securities in unrealized loss positions for less than 12 months. 
 These unrealized losses are primarily the result of non-credit-related volatility in the market and market interest rates. Since none of the unrealized losses relate to the issuers' ability to honor redemption obligations, and the Company does not intend to sell the related securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before recovery of amortized cost, none of the losses have been recognized in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 All mortgage-backed securities in the Company s portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were backed by U.S. government sponsored enterprises GSEs ).

Standby letters of credit Airplane purchase agreement commitments Total unfunded off-balance-sheet credit risk 
 (1) Includes unfunded overdraft protection. 
 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Commitment letters are issued after approval of the loan by the Credit Department and generally expire after issuance. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Company deems necessary. 
 The allowance for off-balance-sheet credit exposures was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, in expense related to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a thousand expense reversal and million in expense, respectively, related to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, this expense was presented in the provision for credit losses. This expense has historically been presented in other expense and that classification remains unchanged for prior periods. 
 Other Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions for on-balance-sheet investments in the amount of million and million, respectively. 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 The distribution of commitments to extend credit approximates the distribution of loans outstanding. The Company generally does not have a significant number of credits to any single borrower or group of related borrowers whereby their retained unguaranteed exposure exceeds million, except for relationships that have a retained unguaranteed exposure of billion of which billion of the unguaranteed exposure has been disbursed. 
 Additionally, the Company has future minimum lease payments receivable under non-cancelable operating leases totaling million, of which no relationships exceed million. 
 The Company from time-to-time may have cash and cash equivalents on deposit with other financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits.

 Nature of Operations 
 Bancshares is a financial holding company and a bank holding company headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina incorporated under the laws of the state of North Carolina in December 2008. The Company conducts business operations primarily through its commercial bank subsidiary, Live Oak Banking Company (the Bank ). The Bank was incorporated in February 2008 as a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank. The Bank specializes in providing lending and deposit related services to small businesses nationwide. A significant portion of the loans originated by the Bank are guaranteed by the SBA under the 7(a) Loan Program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture s USDA Rural Energy for America Program REAP ), Water and Environmental Program WEP ), Business Industry B I and Community Facilities loan programs. These loans are to small businesses and professionals with what the Bank believes are lower risk characteristics. Industries, or verticals, on which the Bank focuses its lending efforts are carefully selected. The Bank also lends more broadly to select borrowers outside of those verticals. 
 The Company s wholly owned material subsidiaries are the Bank, Government Loan Solutions GLS ), Live Oak Grove, LLC Grove ), Live Oak Ventures, Inc. Live Oak Ventures and Canapi Advisors, LLC Canapi Advisors ). GLS is a management and technology consulting firm that advises and offers solutions and services to participants in the government guaranteed lending sector. GLS primarily provides services in connection with the settlement, accounting, and securitization processes for government guaranteed loans, including loans originated under the SBA 7(a) loan programs and USDA guaranteed loans. The Grove provides Company employees and business visitors with on-site dining. Live Oak Ventures purpose is investing in businesses that align with the Company's strategic initiative to be a leader in financial technology. Canapi Advisors provided investment advisory services to a series of funds (the Canapi Funds focused on providing venture capital to new and emerging financial technology companies. During the third quarter of 2024, the Canapi Funds were restructured and Canapi Advisors voluntarily withdrew as an investment advisor to the funds. 
 The Bank s wholly owned subsidiaries are Live Oak Number One, Inc., Live Oak Clean Energy Financing LLC LOCEF ), Live Oak Private Wealth, LLC Live Oak Private Wealth and Tiburon Land Holdings, LLC TLH ). Live Oak Number One, Inc. holds properties foreclosed on by the Bank. LOCEF provides financing to entities for renewable energy applications. Live Oak Private Wealth provides high-net-worth individuals and families with strategic wealth and investment management services. TLH holds land adjacent to the Bank's headquarters consisting of wetlands and other protected property for the use and enjoyment of the Bank's employees and customers. 
 The Company generates revenue primarily from net interest income and secondarily through the origination and sale of government guaranteed loans. Income from the retention of loans is comprised principally of interest income. Income from the sale of loans is comprised of loan servicing revenue and revaluation of related servicing assets along with net gains on sales of loans. Offsetting these revenues are the cost of funding sources, provision for credit losses, any costs related to foreclosed assets and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, travel, professional services, advertising and marketing and tax expense. The Company also has less routinely generated gains and losses arising from its financial technology investments predominantly in its Fintech segment, as discussed more fully later in this section under the caption Results of Segment Operations.

 Results of Operations 
 Performance Summary 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 13.0 million, or 0.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of 39.8 million, or 0.88 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. 
 The decrease in net income was principally due to the following items: 
 Increased provision for credit losses of 24.2 million. The level of provision in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily the result of specific reserve changes on individually evaluated loans and continued growth of the loan and lease portfolio. 
 Increased net loss on the loan servicing asset revaluation of 15.5 million. The level of negative change in valuation of servicing assets was principally due to the third quarter of 2023 change in valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of servicing rights, which resulted in a nonrecurring gain of 13.7 million during that period. 
 A key factor partially offsetting the decrease in net income for the third quarter of 2024 was increased net interest income of 7.6 million. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 67.6 million, or 1.48 per diluted share, compared to net income of 57.7 million, or 1.28 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in net income was largely due to the following items: 
 Increased net interest income of 22.7 million, or 8.9 ; 
 Increased net gains on sales of loans of 8.9 million, or 26.4 , principally the result of higher loan sale volumes combined with improving premiums in the first nine months of 2024; 
 A 5.6 million increase in the net gain on loans accounted for under the fair value option; and 
 Increased other noninterest income of 16.5 million, largely related to the combination of a 2.4 million gain from the sale of a building in the third quarter of 2024, 6.7 million gain arising from the sale of one of the Company s aircraft in the second quarter of 2024 and a 5.7 million gain in the first quarter of 2024 arising from the increased fair value of a certain equity warrant asset. 
 
 The key factors partially offsetting the increase in net income for the first nine months of 2024 was provision for credit losses of 20.3 million, increased net loss on the loan servicing asset revaluation of 18.7 million and increased salaries and employee benefits of 7.3 million. 
 Net Interest Income and Margin 
 Net interest income represents the difference between the income that the Company earns on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company s net interest income depends upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates that the Company earns or pays on them, respectively. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as rate changes. As a bank without a branch network, the Bank gathers deposits over the Internet and in the community in which it is headquartered. Due to the nature of a branchless bank and the relatively low overhead required for deposit gathering, the rates that the Bank offers are generally above the industry average.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 7.6 million, or 8.5 , to 97.0 million compared to 89.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was principally due to the growth in the held for investment loan and lease portfolio outpacing growth in interest-bearing liabilities, offset by an increase in average cost of funds, which exceeded the increase in average yield on interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets increased by 1.05 billion, or 10.0 , to 11.57 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 10.52 billion for the third quarter of 2023, while the yield on average interest-earning assets increased 37 basis points to 7.18 . The cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 increased 45 basis points to 4.17 and the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 946.9 million, or 9.7 , over the third quarter of 2023. The increase in cost of funds was largely influenced by repricing of short-term certificates of deposits. 
 As indicated in the rate/volume analysis below, the overall increase discussed above is reflected in increased interest income of 28.3 million outpacing growth in interest expense of 20.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin decreased from 3.37 for the third quarter of 2023 to 3.33 for the third quarter of 2024. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 22.7 million, or 8.9 , to 278.4 million compared to 255.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was principally due to the growth in the held for investment loan and lease portfolio outpacing growth in interest-bearing liabilities offset by an increase in average cost of funds which exceeded the increase in average yield on interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets increased by 1.05 billion, or 10.4 , to 11.22 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.17 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the yield on average interest-earning assets increased 54 basis points to 7.14 . The cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 64 basis points to 4.13 , and the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 954.8 million, or 10.1 , over the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of funds was largely influenced by repricing of short-term certificates of deposit with the average cost of funds increasing from 3.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was largely driven by funding for significant loan originations and growth as well as maintenance of the Company's target liquidity profile. As indicated in the rate/volume analysis below, the overall increase discussed above is reflected in increased interest income of 98.1 million outpacing growth in interest expense of 75.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin decreased from 3.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In September 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds upper target rate by 50 basis points to 5.0 . The Federal Reserve released its most current federal funds target rate midpoint projections which implied a decrease of the median Federal Funds rate to 4.4 by the end of 2024 and a decrease of approximately 100 basis points to 3.4 by the end of 2025. There can be no assurance that any further decreases or increases in the Federal Funds rate will occur, and if they do, the amount and timing of actual adjustments are subject to change. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for information about the Company s sensitivity to interest rates.

 Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, increases or decreases attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionally based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses represents the amount necessary to be charged against the current period s earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans and leases at a level that the Company believes is appropriate in relation to the estimated expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio. 
 Losses inherent in loan relationships are mitigated if a portion of the loan is guaranteed by the SBA or USDA. Typical SBA 7(a) and USDA guarantees range from 50 to 90 depending on loan size and type, which serve to reduce the risk profile of these loans. The Company believes that its focus on compliance with regulations and guidance from the SBA and USDA are key factors to managing this risk. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, there was a provision for credit losses of 34.5 million compared to 10.3 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 24.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a provision for credit losses of 62.6 million compared to 42.3 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 20.3 million. The increase in provision expense as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of specific reserve changes on individually evaluated loans and continued growth of the loan and lease portfolio. Provision expense for three individually evaluated loan relationships amounted to 13.6 million, or 56.3 , and 67.2 of the increase in the total provision for credit losses when compared to the third quarter of 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Loans and leases held for investment at historical cost were 9.49 billion as of September 30, 2024, increasing by 1.70 billion, or 21.8 , compared to September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Net charge-offs for loans and leases carried at historical cost were 1.7 million, or 0.08 of average quarterly loans and leases held for investment, carried at historical cost, on an annualized basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 9.1 million, or 0.48 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7.4 million, or 81.3 . The decrease in net charge-offs compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily related to one significant charge-off that occurred in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , net charge-offs totaled 13.1 million compared to 16.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , a decrease of 3.8 million , or 22.5 . Net charge-offs are a key element of historical experience in the Company's estimation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. 
 In addition, nonperforming loans and leases not guaranteed by the SBA or USDA, excluding 8.7 million and 6.5 million accounted for under the fair value option at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, totaled 49.4 million, which was 0.52 of the held for investment loan and lease portfolio carried at historical cost at September 30, 2024, compared to 33.3 million, or 0.43 of loans and leases held for investment carried at historical cost at September 30, 2023. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income is principally comprised of net gains from the sale of SBA and USDA-guaranteed loans along with loan servicing revenue and related revaluation of the servicing asset. Revenue from the sale of loans depends upon the volume, maturity structure and rates of underlying loans as well as the pricing and availability of funds in the secondary markets prevailing in the period between completed loan funding and closing of sale. In addition, the loan servicing revaluation is significantly impacted by changes in market rates and other underlying assumptions such as prepayment speeds and default rates. Net gain (loss) on loans accounted for under the fair value option is also significantly impacted by changes in market rates, prepayment speeds and inherent credit risk. Other less consistent elements of noninterest income include gains and losses on investments. 
 The following table shows the components of noninterest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income decreased by 5.0 million, or 13.1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease over the prior year is primarily the result of a 15.5 million decrease in the valuation of the loan servicing asset. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income increased by 11.6 million, or 14.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase over the prior year is primarily a result of higher net gains on sales of loans of 8.9 million, a 5.6 million increase in the net gain on loans accounted for under the fair value option and increased other noninterest income of 16.5 million. The increase in other noninterest income was largely related to the above mentioned 2.4 million gain from the sale of a building in the third quarter of 2024 combined with a 6.7 million gain arising from the sale of one of the Company s aircraft in the second quarter of 2024 and a 5.7 million gain in the first quarter of 2024 arising from the increased fair value of a certain equity warrant asset. Partially offsetting the increase in total noninterest income over the prior year to date period was higher losses of 18.7 million related to the servicing asset revaluation. 
 The following tables reflects loan and lease production, sales of guaranteed loans and the aggregate balance in guaranteed loans sold. These components are key drivers of the Company's noninterest income.

 Changes in various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below. 
 Loan Servicing Asset Revaluation: The Company revalues its serviced loan portfolio at least quarterly. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as adequate compensation for servicing, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and default rates and losses, with prepayment speed and discount rate being the most sensitive assumptions. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was a net loss on loan servicing asset revaluation of 4.2 million, compared to a net gain of 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a negative change of 15.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a net loss on loan servicing asset revaluation of 9.8 million compared to a net gain of 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a negative change of 18.7 million. The negative change in valuation of the servicing asset compared to the third quarter of 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was principally the result of the third quarter of 2023 change in valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of servicing rights. 
 Net Gains on Sales of Loans: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net gains on sales of loans increased 4.0 million, or 31.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The volume of guaranteed loans sold increased 40.7 million, or 18.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 266.3 million from 225.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net gains on sales of loans increased 8.9 million, or 26.4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the volume of guaranteed loans sold increased 64.9 million, or 10.2 , to 703.4 million from 638.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average net gain on loan sale premium increased from 105 to 107 in the third quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively, and remained relatively stable at 106 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. The increase in net gains on sales of loans over the third quarter of 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was principally related to a higher loan sale volume combined with improving premiums. 
 Net Gain (Loss) on Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option : For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net gain on loans accounted for under the fair value option of 2.3 million compared to a net loss of 568 thousand for the third quarter of 2023, a positive change of 2.8 million, or 497.0 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net gain on loans accounted for under the fair value option of 2.2 million compared to a net loss of 3.4 million for the same period of 2023, a positive change of 5.6 million, or 165.5 . The carrying amount of loans accounted for under the fair value option at September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 343.4 million (all classified as held for investment) and 410.1 million (all classified as held for investment), respectively, a decrease of 66.8 million, or 16.3 . The increased levels of net gains arising from the valuation of loans accounted for under the fair value option for both comparative periods was principally due to the third quarter of 2023 change in valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of loans.

 Total noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 3.3 million, or 4.5 , and increased 3.3 million, or 1.4 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The changes within noninterest expense for the comparable three and nine month periods was largely driven by various components, as discussed below. 
 Salaries and employee benefits : Total personnel expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.6 million, or 3.7 , and increased by 7.3 million, or 5.6 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase over both comparative periods of 2023 is principally related to continued investment in human resources to support strategic and growth initiatives. Total full-time equivalent employees increased from 956 at September 30, 2023, to 999 at September 30, 2024. Salaries and employee benefits expense included 6.7 million and 19.9 million of stock-based compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 217 thousand and 12.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Expenses related to the employee stock purchase program, stock grants, stock option compensation and restricted stock expense are all considered stock-based compensation. 
 Professional services expense: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, professional services expense increased 3.5 million, or 75.6 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase compared to the prior year was due to higher levels of legal fees partially offset by an insurance recovery of 1.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. 
 FDIC insurance: For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, FDIC insurance decreased 2.2 million, or 53.0 , and 4.8 million, or 38.1 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. This decrease is largely the product of favorable changes in the Company s FDIC assessment rates. 
 Other expense : For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense decreased 3.5 million, or 29.0 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was largely related to reserves for unfunded commitments, historically being presented in other expense. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, this expense was classified in the provision for credit losses. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 4.8 million compared to income tax expense of 3.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, and the Company s effective tax rates were 27.0 and 6.9 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 8.4 million compared to 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the Company s effective tax rates were 11.1 and 11.6 , respectively. The higher level of income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily the result of lower levels of anticipated investment tax credits in 2024 as compared to the prior year. 
 
 Results of Segment Operations 
 The Company s operations are managed along two primary operating segments Banking and Fintech. A description of each segment and the methodologies used to measure financial performance is described in Note 11. Segments in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income (loss) by operating segment is presented below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Banking 16,208 42,389 76,105 64,400 Fintech (1,111) (1,418) (3,662) (2,506) Other (2,072) (1,178) (4,869) (4,159) Consolidated net income 13,025 39,793 67,574 57,735 
 Banking 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income decreased 26.2 million and increased 11.7 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. Key factors influencing these changes are discussed below.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 9.2 million, or 10.3 , and 25.8 million, or 10.1 , respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. See above section captioned Net Interest Income and Margin as it is principally related to the Banking segment. 
 The provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 24.2 million, or 235.7 , and 20.3 million, or 48.0 , respectively. See the analysis of provision for credit losses included in the above section captioned Provision for Credit Losses as it is entirely related to the Banking segment. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income decreased 4.5 million, or 12.7 , and increased 14.3 million, or 19.3 , respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. The primary driver for lower noninterest income in the third quarter of 2024 was the net loss on the valuation of the loan servicing asset. Alternatively, the increase in noninterest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally driven by higher net gains on sales of loans combined with increased levels of net gains on loans accounted for at fair value and heightened levels of other noninterest income. Partially offsetting the increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was higher levels of net losses on the loan servicing asset revaluation. See the analysis of these categories of noninterest income included in the above section captioned Noninterest Income for additional discussion. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense increased 3.9 million and 3.6 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. See the analysis of these categories of noninterest expense included in the above section captioned Noninterest Expense for additional discussion. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense increased 2.7 million and 4.5 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was largely the result of lower levels of anticipated investment tax credits in 2024 as compared to the prior year. See the above section captioned Income Tax Expense for further discussion. 
 Fintech 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income increased by 307 thousand and decreased 1.2 million, respectively, compared to same periods of 2023. This decrease was largely related to decreased management fee income. This decrease was the result of a restructuring of the Canapi Funds in the third quarter of 2024. In connection with that restructuring, the Company s subsidiary Canapi Advisors voluntarily withdrew as an advisor to the funds. The Company remains an investor in the Canapi Funds and continues its focus on new and emerging financial technology companies. 
 
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
 September 30, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 
 Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 12.61 billion, an increase of 1.34 billion, or 11.9 , compared to total assets of 11.27 billion at December 31, 2023. The growth in total assets was principally driven by the growth in total loans and leases held for investment of 1.20 billion, or 13.9 , during the first nine months of 2024, from 8.63 billion at December 31, 2023, to 9.83 billion at September 30, 2024. This growth was a result of record level origination activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.73 billion. 
 Total deposits were 11.40 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.13 billion, or 11.0 , from 10.28 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total deposits from the prior period was to support growth in the loan and lease portfolio as well as the Company's targeted liquidity levels. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s total uninsured deposits were approximately 1.65 billion, or 14.4 , of total deposits. 
 Borrowings increased to 115.4 million at September 30, 2024, from 23.4 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was principally due to entering into a new loan agreement in the first quarter of 2024 to strategically enhance Bank capital levels in order to accommodate future growth expectations. See Note 8. Borrowings in the accompanying Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of current sources of available debt capacity.

 Regulatory Impact of Asset Growth 
 General. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company and the Bank each first exceeded 10 billion in total assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank each had total assets of 12.61 billion and 12.53 billion, respectively. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies and banks with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As a general matter, the Company and the Bank are not immediately subject to these additional requirements when they exceed 10 billion in assets; instead, the Company and the Bank will be subject to these various requirements over various dates, as described below. 
 Consumer Financial Laws. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has near-exclusive supervision authority, including examination authority, to assess compliance with federal consumer financial laws for a bank and its affiliates if the bank has total assets of more than 10 billion. This provision becomes applicable to a bank following the fourth consecutive quarter where the total assets of the bank, as reported in its quarterly Call Report, exceed 10 billion and afterwards remains applicable to the bank unless the bank has reported total assets of 10 billion or less in its quarterly Call Report for four consecutive quarters. This provision became applicable to the Bank in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Deposit Insurance Assessments. Also under the Dodd-Frank Act, the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC was increased from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent and the FDIC is required, in setting deposit insurance assessments, to offset the effect of the increase on institutions with assets of less than 10 billion, which results in institutions with assets greater than 10 billion paying higher assessments. In addition, following the fourth consecutive quarter where the total assets of a bank exceeds 10 billion, as reported in its quarterly Call Report, the FDIC utilizes a different method for determining deposit insurance assessments. This large bank method is based on a bank s ability to withstand asset- and funding-related stress, its regulatory ratings, and potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the bank s failure, subject to discretionary adjustments by the FDIC. Additionally, the large bank method captures risk mitigants such as the Bank's unique concentration of government guaranteed loans and its impact on our perceived loss severity measure which is generally favorable to the Bank's deposit insurance assessments. The Bank became subject to the large bank method for determining its deposit insurance assessments in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Volcker Rule. Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the Volcker Rule, certain limitations are placed on the ability of insured depository institutions and their affiliates to engage in sponsoring, investing in and transacting with certain investment funds, known as covered funds under the rule. There are a number of exclusions from the definition of covered funds, including for investments in Small Business Investment Companies, or SBICs, and certain qualifying venture capital funds. The Volcker Rule also places restrictions on proprietary trading, which could impact certain hedging activities. 
 Limits on Interchange Fees. The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act gave the Federal Reserve Board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by a payment card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of 10 billion or more, as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted rules under this provision that limit the swipe fees that a debit card issuer can charge a merchant for a transaction to the sum of 21 cents and five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs. The Bank exceeded 10 billion in assets at December 31, 2023. This will trigger a reduction of annual pre-tax income from debit card interchange fees beginning July 1, 2024.

 Asset Quality 
 Management considers asset quality to be of primary importance. A formal loan review function, independent of loan origination, is used to identify and monitor problem loans. This function reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 The Bank places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due as to principal or interest payments, or prior to that if management has determined based upon current information available to them that the timely collection of principal or interest is not probable. When a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued as income but not actually collected is reversed and recorded as a reduction of loan or lease interest and fee income. Typically, collections of interest and principal received on a nonaccrual loan or lease are applied to the outstanding principal as determined at the time of collection of the loan or lease. 
 Nonperforming assets, including loans measured at fair value, at September 30, 2024 were 283.6 million, which represented a 91.4 million, or 47.6 , increase from December 31, 2023. These nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were comprised of 275.6 million in nonaccrual loans and leases and 8.0 million in foreclosed assets. Of the 275.6 million of nonperforming assets, 221.5 million carried a government guarantee, leaving an unguaranteed exposure of 62.1 million in total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024. This represents an increase of 10.9 million, or 21.4 , from an unguaranteed exposure of 51.2 million at December 31, 2023.

 Nonperforming assets, excluding loans measured at fair value, at September 30, 2024 were 223.6 million, which represented a 82.1 million, or 58.1 , increase from December 31, 2023. These nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were comprised of 215.6 million in nonaccrual loans and leases and 8.0 million in foreclosed assets. Of the 223.6 million of nonperforming assets, 171.0 million carried a government guarantee, leaving an unguaranteed exposure of 52.6 million in total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024. This represents an increase of 10.5 million, or 24.8 , from an unguaranteed exposure of 42.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 See the below discussion related to the change in potential problem and impaired loans and leases for management s overall observations regarding growth in total nonperforming loans and leases. 
 As a percentage of the Bank s total capital, nonperforming loans and leases, excluding loans measured at fair value, represented 19.2 and 14.6 September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Adjusting the ratio to include only the unguaranteed portion of nonperforming loans and leases at historical cost to reflect management s belief that the greater magnitude of risk resides in this portion, the ratios at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 4.4 and 4.3 , respectively.

 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, potential problem (also referred to as criticized) and classified loans and leases, excluding loans measured at fair value, totaled 951.5 million and 785.2 million, respectively. The following is a discussion of these loans and leases. Risk Grades 50 through 80 represent the spectrum of criticized and classified loans and leases. For a complete description of the risk grading system, see Note 5. Loans and Leases Held for Investment and Credit Quality. At September 30, 2024 , the portion of criticized and classified loans and leases guaranteed by the SBA or USDA totaled 448.8 million and total portfolio unguaranteed exposure risk was 502.7 million , or 7.9 of total held for investment unguaranteed exposure carried at historical cost. This compares to the December 31, 2023 portion of criticized and classified loans and leases guaranteed by the SBA or USDA which totaled 344.8 million and total portfolio unguaranteed exposure risk was 440.3 million , or 8.3 of total held for investment unguaranteed exposure carried at historical cost . 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , loans and leases carried at historical cost within the following verticals comprise the largest portion of the total potential problem and classified loans and leases:

 Of the above listed verticals, Senior Housing and Sponsor Finance are within the Company s Specialty Lending division, Bioenergy, Community Facilities and Hotels are within the Energy Infrastructure division, and the remainder of the above listed verticals are within the Small Business Banking division. Total criticized and classified loans and leases increased 166.3 million in the first nine months of 2024. This increase by loan and lease risk grade categories was comprised of a decrease of 73.2 million for those identified as criticized offset by an increase of 239.5 for those identified as classified, of which 169.4 million is guaranteed and 70.1 million is unguaranteed. There were five large loan relationships that were added to classified loans in the third quarter of 2024 which comprised 78.7 of the change in unguaranteed classified loans. The Company continues its focus on underwriting standards and credit quality in a high interest rate environment. Additionally, the Company actively considers changing economic conditions related to portfolio management. 
 Loans and leases that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls are generally not individually evaluated for the purpose of estimating the allowance for credit losses. The Bank generally considers an insignificant period of time from payment delays to be a period of 90 days or less. The Bank would consider a modification for a customer experiencing what is expected to be a short-term event that has temporarily impacted cash flow. This could be due, among other reasons, to illness, weather, impact from a one-time expense, slower than expected start-up, construction issues or other short-term issues. Credit personnel will review the request to determine if the customer is stressed and how the event has impacted the ability of the customer to repay the loan or lease long term. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 14.3 million in loans modified in 2024 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, all of which remained current with 8.3 million on principal payment deferral. 
 Management endeavors to be proactive in its approach to identify and resolve p roblem loans and leases and is focused on working with the borrowers and guarantors of these loans and leases to provide loan and lease modifications when warranted. Management implements a proactive approach to identifying and classifying loans and leases as special mention (also referred to as criticized), Risk Grade 50. At September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , Risk Grade 50 loans and leases, excluding lo ans measured at fair value, totaled 526.0 million and 599.2 million, respectively, for a decrease of 73.2 million. Relative to total held for investment unguaranteed exposure carried at historical cost at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unguaranteed Risk Grade 50 loans and leases decreased to 5.5 from 7.3 , respectively.

 The largest year-to-date changes in Risk Grade 50 loans and leases carried at historical cost were within the foll owing verticals : 
 September 30, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) Vertical Sponsor Finance 30,017 41.0 Healthcare 29,715 40.6 Veterinary 18,239 24.5 RV Parks 10,284 14.0 Commercial Real Estate Financing 7,535 10.3 Deathcare 6,511 8.9 Venture Banking (6,157) (8.4) Agriculture (6,817) (9.3) Educational Services (7,242) (9.9) Fitness Centers (9,380) (12.8) Government Contractors (11,864) (16.2) Senior Housing (30,611) (41.8) Bioenergy (107,114) (146.3) Total of largest changes in Risk Grade 50 loans and leases (76,884) (105.4) 
 
 The decrease in Risk Grade 50 loans and leases, exclusive of loans measured at fair value, during the first nine months of 2024 was principally confined to 13 verticals, as reflected above. The primary driver for the decline in Risk Grade 50 loans and leases was a migration to improvement within the Senior Housing portfolio coupled with two large Bioenergy relationships moving to classified status in the third quarter of 2024. Of the above listed verticals, Sponsor Finance, Senior Housing, Government Contactors, Venture Banking and Commercial Real Estate Financing are within the Company s Specialty Lending division, Bioenergy is within the Energy Infrastructure division, and the remainder of the above listed verticals are within the Small Business Banking division. 
 At September 30, 2024, approximately 94.4 of loans and leases classified as Risk Grade 50 are performing with no relationships having payments past due more than 30 days. While the level of nonperforming assets fluctuates in response to changing economic and market conditions, in light of the relative size and composition of the loan and lease portfolio and management s degree of success in resolving problem assets, management believes that a proactive approach to early identification and intervention is critical to successfully managing a small business loan portfolio. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 
 The ACL of 125.8 million at December 31, 2023, increased by 42.9 million, or 34.1 , to 168.7 million at September 30, 2024. The ACL as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment at historical cost amounted to 1.5 and 1.8 at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the ACL during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily the result of specific reserve changes on individually evaluated loans and continued growth of the loan and lease portfolio. See also the above section captioned Provision for Credit Losses in Results of Operations for related information.

 Actual past due held for in vestment loans and leases, inclusive of loans measured at fair value, have in creased by 174.0 million since December 31, 2023 . Total loans and leases 90 or more days past due in creased 70.9 million , or 56.9 , compared to December 31, 2023 . This increase was comprised of a 917 thousand decrease in unguaranteed exposure combined with an offsetting 71.8 million increase in the guaranteed portion of past due loans compared to December 31, 2023 . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , total held for investment unguaranteed loans and leases past due as a percentage of total held for investment unguaranteed loans and leases, inclusive of loans measured at fair value, was 1.8 and 0.8 , respectively. Total unguaranteed loa ns and leases past due were comprised of 104.8 million carried at historical cost, an in crease of 67.1 million , and 12.8 million measured at fair value, an increase of 3.0 million , as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 . Management continues to actively monitor and work to improve asset quality. Management believes the ACL of 168.7 million at September 30, 2024 is appropriate in light of the risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. Management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current and expected events that it believes to be reasonable, but which may or may not be valid. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the ACL, thus adversely affecting the Company s operating results. Additional information on the ACL is presented in Note 5. Loans and Leases Held for Investment and Credit Quality of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 
 
 Liquidity Management 
 Liquidity management refers to the ability to meet day-to-day cash flow requirements based primarily on activity in loan and deposit accounts of the Company s customers. Liquidity is immediately available from four major sources: (a) cash on hand and on deposit at other banks; (b) the outstanding balance of federal funds sold; (c) the market value of unpledged investment securities; and (d) availability under lines of credit, FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Discount Window. A primary tool in the Company's liquidity management process is the utilization of an Outflow Coverage Ratio OCR model to stress outflows in various scenarios with targeted days of liquidity coverage. At September 30, 2024, the total amount of these four liquidity source items was 4.36 billion, or 34.6 of total assets, a decrease of 3.2 of total assets from 4.26 billion, or 37.8 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. 
 Loans and other assets are funded primarily by loan sales, wholesale deposits, and core deposits. To date, an increasing retail deposit base and a stable amount of brokered deposits have been adequate to meet loan obligations, while maintaining the desired level of immediate liquidity. The Company maintains an investment securities portfolio that is available for both immediate and secondary contingent liquidity purposes, whether via pledging to the Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, or through liquidation. Additionally, the Company maintains a guaranteed loan portfolio that is also a contingent liquidity source, whether via pledging to the Federal Reserve Discount Window or through liquidation. 
 At September 30, 2024, none of the investment securities portfolio was pledged to secure public deposits or pledged to retail repurchase agreements, leaving 1.23 billion available to be pledged as collateral. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company has entered into significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations for future payments. In March 2024, the Company entered into a 100.0 million term loan agreement with a third party correspondent bank. See Note 8. Borrowings in the accompanying notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Other than the new borrowing previously mentioned and normal changes in the ordinary course of the Company s operations, there have been no significant changes in the types of contractual obligations or amounts due since December 31, 2023. See the section titled Liquidity Management in Part II, Item 7 of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion of contractual obligations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, there was one airplane purchase agreement commitment outstanding and during 2024 the airplane was placed in service. For more information, see Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 One of the primary objectives of asset/liability management is to maximize the net interest margin while minimizing the earnings risk associated with changes in interest rates. One method used to manage interest rate sensitivity is to measure the repricing differences, or interest rate gaps, between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, across various time periods. As of September 30, 2024, the balance sheet s total cumulative gap position was 3.1 , meaning that over the entire life of the Company's assets and liabilities, more assets will reprice than liabilities. For further information, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 The interest rate gap method, however, addresses only the magnitude of asset and liability repricing timing differences as of the report date and does not address earnings, market value, changes in account behaviors based on the interest rate environment, or growth. Therefore, management also uses an earnings simulation model to prepare, on a regular basis, earnings projections based on a range of instantaneous parallel interest rate shocks applied to a static balance sheet and non-parallel interest rate shocks applied to a dynamic balance sheet to measure interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s interest rate risk profile is asset-sensitive under the instantaneous parallel interest rate shock scenarios applied to a static balance sheet. For more information, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 An asset-sensitive position means that net interest income will generally move in the same direction as interest rates. For instance, if interest rates increase, net interest income can be expected to increase, and if interest rates decrease, net interest income can be expected to decrease. The Company attempts to mitigate interest rate risk by match funding assets and liabilities with similar rate instruments. Asset/liability sensitivity is primarily derived from the prime-based loans that adjust as the prime interest rate changes, rates on cash accounts that adjust as the federal funds rate changes and the longer duration of indeterminate term deposits. Note that the Company regularly models various forecasted rate projections with non-parallel shifts that are reflective of potential current rate environment outcomes. Under these scenarios, the Company s interest rate risk profile may increase in asset sensitivity, decrease in asset sensitivity, or depending on the scenario and timing of anticipated rate changes, may transition to a liability-sensitive interest rate risk profile. The Company believes that regular modeling of various interest rate outcomes allows it to assess and manage potential risks from various rate shifts. 
 
 Capital 
 The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. The Company s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are the following: to provide adequate capital to support the Company s risk profile consistent with the risk appetite approved by the Board of Directors; to provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs; to comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance; to achieve optimal ratings for the Company and its subsidiaries; and to provide a competitive return to shareholders. Management regularly monitors the capital position of the Company on both a consolidated and bank level basis. In this regard, management s goal is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of the regulatory well capitalized levels. Risk-based capital ratios, which include Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Accounting policies, including those for the Company's critical accounting policies, as described in detail in the Notes to the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, are an integral part of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing the Company s reported results of operations and financial position. The Company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are listed below. These estimates require the Company to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 Allowance for credit losses; 
 Valuation of loans accounted for under the fair value option; 
 Valuation of servicing assets; and

 Income taxes 
 Changes in these estimates, that are likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that the Company could have reasonably used in the current period, could have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest rate risk is a significant market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, widening or tightening of credit spreads, changes in the general level of market interest rates and changes in the shape and level of market yield curves. The Company manages the interest rate sensitivity of interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving available-for-sale securities, loan and lease portfolio, and available funding sources. 
 The Company has an Asset/Liability Committee to support prudent oversight of interest rate risk management. The Asset/Liability Committee monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. Adherence to relevant policies is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Asset/Liability Committee. 
 The Company has a total cumulative gap in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of 3.1 as of September 30, 2024, indicating that, overall, over the expected life of the instruments, assets will reprice before liabilities. 
 The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The Company analyzes interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of two simulation models: economic value of equity EVE and net interest income NII simulations. These simulations project both short-term and long-term interest rate risk under a variety of instantaneous parallel rate shocks applied to a static balance sheet. The EVE simulation provides a long-term view of interest rate risk because it analyzes all of the Company s future cash flows. EVE is defined as the present value of the Company s assets, less the present value of its liabilities, adjusted for any off-balance sheet items. The results show a theoretical change in the economic value of shareholders equity as interest rates change. The NII simulation provides a short-term view of interest rate risk as it analyzes impact on net interest income over the next 12 and 24 months from instantaneous parallel rate shocks on a static balance sheet. 
 EVE and NII simulations are completed regularly and presented to the Asset/Liability Committee. The simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on equity and net interest income under a range of assumptions. The numerous assumptions used in the simulation process are provided to the Asset/Liability Committee on at least an annual basis. Changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation. The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates. The simulation analysis incorporates management s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors. 
 Simulation analysis is only an estimate of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time. The Company regularly models various forecasted rate projections with non-parallel shifts that are reflective of potential current rate environment outcomes. Under these scenarios, the Company s interest rate risk profile may increase in asset sensitivity, decrease in asset sensitivity, or depending on the scenario and timing of anticipated rate changes, may transition to a liability sensitive interest rate risk profile. The Company believes that regular modeling of various interest rate outcomes allows it to assess and manage potential risks from various rate shifts.

Table of Contents 

 The table below sets forth an approximation of the Company s NII sensitivity exposure for the 12-month periods ending September 30, 2025 and 2026, and the Company s EVE sensitivity at September 30, 2024. The simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments. Critical model assumptions such as loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit decay rates, changes in deposit pricing, both in amount and timing, relative to changes in market rates (commonly referred to as deposit betas and lags, respectively) and assumed replacement pricing can have a significant impact on interest income simulation. A static balance sheet is maintained to remove volume considerations and to place the focal point on the rate sensitivity of the Company s balance sheet. While management believes such assumptions to be reasonable, actual future activity may differ from the results shown below as it will include growth considerations, non-parallel rate movements, and management actions to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates on the balance sheet s earnings profile. 
 Estimated Increase/Decrease in Net Interest Income Estimated Percentage Change in EVE Basis Point ("bp") Change in Interest Rates 12 Months Ending September 30, 2025 12 Months Ending September 30, 2026 As of September 30, 2024 +400 9.7 6.7 (19.4 +300 7.4 5.2 (14.4) +200 5.1 3.6 (9.2) +100 2.5 1.8 (4.5) -100 (2.5) (1.7) 4.4 -200 (4.4) (3.1) 8.9 -300 (5.6) (4.1) 13.8 
 Rates are increased instantaneously at the beginning of the projection. The Company's asset/liability profile is slightly asset sensitive in both years one and two from a net interest income perspective. The Company s variable rate loan portfolio reprices the full amount of the assumed change in interest rates, while the retail savings and short-term retail certificates of deposits portfolio will reprice with an assumed beta. Interest rates do not normally move all at once or evenly over time, but management believes that the analysis is useful to understanding the potential direction and magnitude of net interest income changes due to changing interest rates. 
 The EVE analysis shows that the Company would theoretically lose market value in a rising rate environment. The favorable EVE change resulting from the loan and lease portfolio in a rising rate analysis is more than offset by the devaluation of the interest-bearing liabilities. This is largely driven by the Company s longer asset duration, primarily consisting of investments and loans, versus the shorter duration of its funding portfolio, primarily consisting of retail savings and short-term retail certificates of deposits. Increased fixed rate loan production since 2020, given the historical low market rate environment, has also been a significant driver in the model results.
