 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 MARCH 31, 2024 (UNAUDITED) 

 . The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses Business Combination ). 
 As of March 31, 2024, the Company had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from March 12, 2021 (inception) through March 31, 2024 related to the Company s formation, its initial public offering IPO or Initial Public Offering ), which is described below, and, subsequent to the IPO, identifying a target company for an initial Business Combination. 
 The registration statement for the Company s IPO was declared effective on November 11, 2021. On November 16, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of units (the Units ), including the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase Units. Each Unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock, par value per share, of the Company (the Public Shares and one-half
 of one redeemable warrant, at per Unit. The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half
 of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for per share, subject to adjustment. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to DHIP Natural Resources Investments, LLC Sponsor ), generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 3. 
 If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at aper-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its income taxes, if any (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds were applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with an initial business combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. 
 Following the closing of the IPO on November 16, 2021, management agreed that an amount equal to at least per Unit sold (or in the Initial Public Offering and the proceeds of the Private Placement Warrants, would be held in a trust account Trust Account with American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC acting as trustee and invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule2a-7promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. 
 The Company will provide its holders of the Public Shares (the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share
 amount to be distributed to Public Stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). The Public Shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 
 The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was adopted by the Company upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, and was amended by certificates of amendment on February 9, 2023 and August 8, 2023 (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to 

or more of the Class A common stock sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. 
 The Company s Sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees agreed not to propose an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide for the redemption of its Public Shares in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A common stock in conjunction with any such amendment. 
 In connection with the redemption of of the Company s outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the Company s taxes payable (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses). 
 The Initial Stockholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the combination period. However, if the Initial Stockholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the combination period. The underwriters will agree to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the combination period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company s Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only per share initially held in the Trust Account. 
 In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.10 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

 The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and while the Company believes it has sufficient access to additional sources of capital, if necessary, there are no assurances that such additional capital will ultimately be available. In addition, the Company currently has less than 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued to complete a Business Combination and if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an Initial Business Combination, it is required to liquidate and dissolve.

205-40,
 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , management has determined that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period.

and ) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily due to the change in the fair value of the warrants, tax interest and penalties, the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets and prior year true-ups. 

While ASC 740 identifies usage of an effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual elements in the current period if they are significant, unusual or infrequent. Computing the effective tax rate for the Company is complicated due to the potential impact of the Company s change in fair value of warrants (or any other change in fair value of a complex financial instrument), the timing of any potential Business Combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expense in a current period based on ASC 740-270-25-3 which states, If an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income (or loss) or the related tax (benefit) but is otherwise able to make a reasonable estimate, the tax (or benefit) applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim period in which the item is reported. The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the usual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate. As such, the Company is computing its taxable income and associated income tax provision based on actual results through March 31, 2024. 

ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
 to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company s management determined that the United States is the Company s only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and underpaid income taxes as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the Company recognized in accrued interest and penalties a t 

March 31, 2024. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.

 excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. 
 Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. 
 In April 2024, the Treasury issued proposed regulations providing guidance with respect to the Excise Tax. Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Under the proposed regulations, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. 

Management has established a liability in the amount of and related to the excise tax included in current liabilities on the Company s balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 If the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, management will consider, among other factors, the Company s cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on its stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s Public Warrants were traded on a market exchange. At December 31, 2023, the Company utilized quoted active market exchange trade pricing to value the Public Warrants (Level 1 inputs). At March 31, 2024, the Company utilized quoted active market exchange trade pricing to value the Public Warrants, however, there was insufficient trading activity for the Public Warrants valuations to be classified as Level 1 and were thus classified as Level 2. At March 31, 2024, the Company determined the Private Warrants were equivalent to the Public Warrants based on the de minimus valuation and commonalities in the terms and conditions of the Public and Private Warrants. As such, the value of the Public Warrants was used to determine the value of the Private Warrants. However, given the lack of trading activity for the Public Warrants, the fair value of the Private Warrants remained classified as a Level 3 valuation as of March 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company utilized an independent third party to value the Private Warrants with a binomial options pricing model (Level 3 inputs). Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the private warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
 yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. 
 
 Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 are recognized at the end of the reporting periods.

The Private Placement Warrants were accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40
 and are presented within warrant liabilities in the Company s balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the statements of operations.

Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware Corporation on March 12, 2021 (inception) formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering in March 12, 2021 (the Initial Public Offering or IPO and the sale of the 9,400,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. Trust Extensions Initially, the Company had 12 months from the closing of the IPO on November 16, 2021 to consummate an initial Business Combination (until November 16, 2022). Additionally, the Company was entitled to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) by depositing into the Trust Account maintained by American Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee, an amount of 0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO, 2,300,000, for each such three-month extension (that would result in a total deposit of 10.30 per public share sold in the event both extensions were elected or an aggregate of 4,600,000). Public stockholders were not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. In November 2022, the Sponsor deposited 2,300,000 into the Trust Account, to extend the deadline for an initial Business Combination three months to February 2023. In lieu of a second 2,300,000 extension payment for a three month extension to May 2023, a special meeting of stockholders was held in February 2023 that resulted in an extension of the deadline to complete an initial Business Combination to March 15, 2023 and allowed the Company to further extend the date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one month through September 15, 2023. In connection with the vote on the extension Amendment at the Special Meeting, stockholders holding a total of 9,155,918 shares of the Company s common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata of the funds in the Company s Trust Account. As a result, 94,489,075 (approximately 10.32 per share) was withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay such holders in February 2023. On August 8, 2023, the Company held its Annual Meeting of Stockholders whereby the stockholders approved the second extension amendment proposal permitting an extension of the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination until February 15, 2024, subject to monthly extension deposits of 140,000, which were made in August 2023 through January 2024. In connection with the vote on the extension Amendment at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholders holding a total of 7,354,836 shares of the Company s common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company s Trust Account. As a result, 79,652,874 (approximately 10.83 per share) was removed from the Company s Trust Account to pay such holders. On February 12, 2024 at a special meeting in lieu of an annual meetings of stockholders of the Company (the February 2024 Special Meeting ), stockholders approved a third extension Amendment Proposal (the Third Extension Amendment Proposal to extend the date by which the Company must (1) effectuate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (an initial Business Combination ), (2) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and (3) redeem 100 of the Company s Class A common stock included as part of the units sold in the Company s initial public offering that was consummated on November 16, 2021 (the IPO ), from February 15, 2024 to March 15, 2024, by depositing (or causing to be deposited) into the trust account (the Trust Account 50,000 for such one-month extension, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to further extend such date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to eight (8) times by an additional one (1) month each time, by resolution of the Company s board of directors (the Board ), until November 15, 2024, or a total of up to nine (9) months after February 15, 2024 (such date as extended, the Deadline Date ), by depositing (or causing to be deposited) into the Trust Account 50,000 for each additional one-month extension on or prior to each applicable Deadline Date, unless the closing of a Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto. In connection with the vote on the third extension amendment proposal at the February 2024 Special Meeting, stockholders holding a total of 4,573,860 shares of the Company s common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company s Trust Account. As a result, 50,312,460 (approximately 11.00 per share) was removed from the Company s Trust Account to pay such holders. In association with the February 2024 redemptions, the Company inadvertently underpaid the redeeming shareholders 395,138 or approximately 0.09 per share.

Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through March 31, 2024 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering and an initial Business Combination, described below. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the initial Public Offering. We have incurred increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence and other expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had a net income of 2,292,526, which consisted of the interest and income earned on cash and investment in the Trust Account of 674,258 and a gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 2,048,200 partially offset by operating costs of 272,128, and a provision for income taxes of 157,804. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had a net loss of 2,413,318 which consisted of operating costs of 450,901 and a non-cash change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 3,344,000 and reinvested interest income on funds held in trust of 1,504,345 and 231,189 unrealized gain on investments held in Trust, and a provision for income taxes of 353,951. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2024, we had 2,079 in cash and a working capital deficit of 10,812,101. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 168,110. Net income of 2,292,526 was affected by a change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of 2,048,200, and interest from marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 674,257. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 261,821 of cash for operating activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was 50,072,460 including cash deposited in Trust Account of 240,000 and a withdrawal funds from the Trust Account to redeeming stockholders for 50,312,460. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 49,902,460 and included 240,000 in proceeds from a note payable from Sponsor and a related party of the Company for 170,000 and a payment to redeeming stockholders for 50,312,460.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company withdrew an aggregate of 224,454,409 for payment to redeeming stockholders. At March 31, 2024, the fair value of the investments held in the Trust Account was 23,333,333 as recognized on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the Company withdrew funds for payment to redeeming stockholders totaling 174,141,949. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the investments held in the Trust Account was 72,731,536 as recognized on the balance sheet. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions, to complete a Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company made no withdrawals of interest earned in the Trust Account to pay taxes. At March 31, 2024, we had cash of 2,079 held outside of the Trust Account, advances from related parties for 100,770 used for working capital purposes, a Note Payable due to the Sponsor of the Company for 5,093,225 for extension purposes, a Note Payable due to a related party used for working capital purposes of 770,000 and an additional working capital loan due to the Sponsor of the Company for 17,935. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. The Company will need to raise additional funds to meet the expenditures required for operating its business as it currently has insufficient funds available to operate the business prior to the initial Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination due to insufficient available funds, it will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and while the Company believes it has sufficient access to additional sources of capital, there are no assurances that such additional capital will ultimately be available. In addition, the Company currently has less than 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued to complete a Business Combination and if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial Business Combination, it is required to liquidate and dissolve. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , management has determined that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations During the period ended March 31, 2024, we entered into a promissory note with a related party for up to 770,000 to fund working capital. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, an affiliate of the Sponsor loaned us 5,093,225 to fund costs related to the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate an initial Business Combination pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended on February 9, 2023, August 8, 2023 and February 12, 2024). We also have an agreement to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, secretarial, and administrative services provided to the Company (except where waived, as described above under Item 1 Business Sources of Target Businesses and elsewhere in this report). We will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination and the Company s liquidation. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or approximately 8.1 million. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Critical Accounting Estimates Warrant Liabilities The Company utilized market prices and models in determining the fair value of the Company s warrants. Assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate are utilized. The fair value of the warrant liabilities is subject to change in future periods based on assumption changes including discount rates and volatility of our stock price. Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguished Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock are classified as stockholders equity. The Company s Class A common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. As of March 31, 2024, 1,915,386 Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of stockholders equity section of the Company s balance sheet.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of March 31, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. The net proceeds held in the Trust Account have been invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to the inadequate controls around the calculation of amounts due and payment of funds from the Trust Account to redeeming shareholders. A material weakness, as defined in the SEC regulations, is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management plans to remediate the material weakness by enhancing our control process around the calculation of amounts due to and payment of funds from the Trust Account to redeeming shareholders. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and these initiatives may not ultimately have the intended effects. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On September 6, 2024, Tyr Energy Utah Logistics, LLC Tyr Energy filed suit in the County Court at Law, Number 1, Nueces County, Texas against the Company, the Sponsor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor, asserting claims for breach of and tortious interference with a non-disclosure and non-circumvention agreement in connection with the public announcement of the proposed Business Combination, for which Tyr Energy seeks a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction. The Sponsor and its affiliates have specially appeared to dispute specific personal jurisdiction, and all defendants, including the Company, vehemently dispute liability and intend to vigorously defend against Tyr Energy s claims. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on April 16, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, other than as disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. We have identified a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, our CEO and CFO identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness identified relates to the Company s inadvertent underpayment to the redeeming shareholders of 395,138 (or approximately 0.09 per share), in connection with the vote on the third extension amendment proposal at the special meeting in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, held on February 12, 2024, as described in greater detail in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Trust Extensions. This material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements included herein. While we already have processes in place to ensure that our periodic reports satisfy the applicable reporting and compliance requirements, we will continue to enhance and invest in accounting resources and processes necessary to comply with the reporting and compliance requirements of a public company and include a greater level of supervision as needed in relation to our disclosure controls and procedures. During the documenting and testing of our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could, in turn, limit our access to capital markets and negatively impact our ability to consummate a business combination. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to delisting, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.
