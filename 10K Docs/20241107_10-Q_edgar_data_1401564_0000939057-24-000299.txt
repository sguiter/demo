 locations in Washington with the headquarters and retail branch locations in King County, retail branch locations in Snohomish County and retail branches in Pierce County. The Bank s primary market area consists of King, Snohomish, Pierce and Kitsap counties, Washington. 
 
 The Bank is a portfolio lender, originating and purchasing one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land development, business, and consumer loans. Loans are primarily funded by deposits from the general public, supplemented by borrowings from the FHLB and deposits raised in the national brokered deposit market. 
 
 On January 10, 2024, Global Federal Credit Union Global ), First Financial Northwest and the Bank entered into a Purchase and Assumption P A Agreement, pursuant to which Global will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities (including deposit liabilities) of the Bank, which we refer to herein as the asset sale, in exchange for million in cash, subject to possible downward adjustments. The asset sale is the first integral step in the sale transaction contemplated by the P A Agreement, which consists of: (1) the asset sale, (2) the voluntary liquidation of the Bank and distribution of the Bank s remaining assets, which will include the cash consideration paid by Global to the Bank in the asset sale, to First Financial Northwest, and (3) the winding up and voluntary dissolution of First Financial Northwest and the distribution of its remaining assets, including the remaining net cash proceeds from the asset sale, to its shareholders. 
 
 Consummation of the asset sale and related transactions is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and expiration of applicable waiting periods, accuracy of specified representations and warranties of each party, the performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the P A Agreement, and the absence of any injunctions or other legal restraints. The P A Agreement provides certain termination rights for both Global and the Bank, and further provides that upon termination of the P A Agreement under certain circumstances, the Bank will be obligated to pay Global a termination fee of million. Additional information regarding the asset sale, including the P A Agreement, can be found in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed by First Financial Northwest with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on June 6, 2024. On July 19, 2024, the Company received its shareholders approval for the asset sale, as well as the proposal to voluntarily dissolve the Company and distribute its net assets following the completion of the asset sale. 
 
 The Bank previously received required regulatory approval from both the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC in connection with the asset sale and Bank liquidation, but consummation of the asset sale remains subject to the required regulatory approval from the National Credit Union Administration NCUA ), which has not been obtained. The Bank cannot provide any assurance as to whether the Bank or Global will obtain the required final regulatory approval from the NCUA, when such approval will be received, or whether there will be any conditions in such approval that are unacceptably burdensome to the Bank or Global. 
 
 As used throughout this report, the terms we, our, us, or the Company refer to First Financial Northwest, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary First Financial Northwest Bank, unless the context otherwise requires.

million of investments classified as held-to-maturity at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In January 2020, the Bank purchased three annuity contracts, totaling million, to be held long-term to satisfy the benefit obligation associated with certain supplemental executive retirement plan SERP agreements. These annuities, along with an associated insurance policy and rider, provide for payments in retirement for the life of the executive. The rider that provides the long-term guarantee for the SERP has no cash value and is not transferable to another annuitant. The cash value of the annuity is representative of the liquidation value of the contract. Hence, the amortized cost of these held-to-maturity investments is their fair value.

 On a quarterly basis, management evaluates available-for-sale AFS debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position to determine if an allowance for credit losses is required. If it is determined that a credit loss exists and an allowance is required, the credit loss on a debt security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that the Company does not intend to sell, and it is not likely that it will be required to sell but does not expect to recover the entire security s amortized cost basis, only the portion of the unrealized loss representing a credit loss would be recognized in earnings. If the Company intends to sell a debt security, or it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovering its cost basis, the entire unrealized loss would be recognized through earnings. The Company considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment, economic circumstances, recent events

securities and securities in an unrealized loss position, with and of these securities in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management does not believe that the unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were related to credit losses. The declines in fair market value of these securities were mainly attributed to changes in market interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Currently, the Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the positions before their recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. As such, no allowance for credit losses was recorded with respect to AFS securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Maturities of investments held-to-maturity (annuities) were established at the time the initial contract was signed. They mature (terminate) upon the earlier of the death of the executives or depletion of the related annuity. 
 
 Under Washington state law, to participate in the public funds program, the Company is required to pledge eligible securities as collateral in an amount equal to of the public deposits held less the FDIC insured amount. Investment securities with market values of million and million were pledged as collateral for public deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, both of which exceeded the collateral requirements established by the Washington Public Deposit Protection Commission.

 Credit Quality Indicators . The Company assigns a risk rating to all credit exposures based on a risk rating system designed to define the basic characteristics and identify risk elements of each credit extension. The Company utilizes a nine-point risk rating system. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades is as follows: 
 
 Grades 1 through 5: These grades are considered to be pass credits. These include assets where there is virtually no credit risk, such as cash secured loans with funds on deposit with the Company. Pass credits also include credits that are on the Company s watch list (grade 5), where the borrower exhibits potential weaknesses, which may, if not checked or corrected, negatively affect the borrower s financial capacity and threaten their ability to fulfill debt obligations in the future. 
 
 Grade 6: These credits, classified as special mention , possess weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. Special mention assets do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification in the substandard, doubtful or loss categories. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration in the Company s credit position at a future date.

 ACL . ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the ACL when management believes the non-collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries may not exceed the aggregate amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. The ACL, as reported in our consolidated balance sheets, is adjusted by a provision or recapture of provision for credit losses, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-offs of loan amounts, net of recoveries. 
 
 When the Company classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, pursuant to Federal regulations, or identifies a loan where it is uncertain if the Company will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan, it may establish a specific allowance in an amount deemed prudent to address the risk specifically. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to the particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, pursuant to Federal regulations, it is required to charge off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. The determination as to the classification of the Company s assets and the amount of valuation allowance is subject to review by bank regulators, who can require the establishment of additional allowances for credit losses.

 operating leases for retail branch locations. The remaining lease terms range from to years, with most leases carrying optional extensions of three to . The Company will include optional lease term extensions in the ROU assets and lease liabilities when management believes it is reasonably certain that the term extension will be exercised, which will be determined based on indicators that the Company would have an economic incentive to extend the lease. The Company has elected to not apply ASU 2016-02 to short-term leases, which are those that have a term of one year or less. The Company did not have any short-term leases as of September 30, 2024. To calculate the present value of lease payments not yet paid, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate, which is equal to the FHLB advance rate for the remaining term of the lease at the time of the lease inception. 
 
 The minimum monthly lease payments are generally based on square footage of the leased premises, with escalating minimum rent over the lease term. At September 30, 2024, the Company was committed to paying per month in minimum monthly lease payments. The minimum monthly lease payment over the initial lease term, including any free rent period, was used to calculate the ROU asset and lease liability. The Company s current leases do not include any non-lease components. 
 
 Total lease expense included on the Company s Consolidated Income Statements includes the amortized lease expense under ASC Topic 842, Leases , combined with variable lease expenses for maintenance or other expenses as defined in the individual lease agreements.

 million and consisted of rolling one-month or three-month FHLB advances that renew at the fixed interest rate at each renewal date. These hedging instruments had original terms between two and , with remaining terms ranging from to years. The weighted average remaining term is years. Under these agreements, the counterparty pays the Company a rate tied to either the one-month or three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). In return, the Company pays a weighted-average fixed interest rate of on a notional amount ranging from million to million per contract. The Company pays or receives the net interest amount monthly or quarterly based on the respective hedge agreement and includes this amount as part of its interest expense on the Company s Consolidated Income Statements. 
 
 Quarterly, the effectiveness evaluation is based upon the fluctuation of the fixed rate interest the Company pays to the FHLB for the period compared to the one-month or three-month SOFR-based interest received from the counterparty. At September 30, 2024, a million net fair value gain of the cash flow hedges was reported in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The tax effected amount of million was included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were amounts recorded on the Consolidated Income Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, related to ineffectiveness. 
 
 Fair value for these derivative instruments, which generally changes as a result of changes in the level of market interest rates, is estimated based on dealer quotes and secondary market sources.

 As a result of the approval of the 2016 Plan, the First Financial Northwest, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan 2008 Plan was frozen with no additional awards being made under the 2008 Plan. Restricted stock awards and stock options that were granted under the 2008 Plan are fully vested and unexercised options remain exercisable, subject to the provisions of the 2008 Plan and the respective award agreements. At September 30, 2024, there were total shares available for grant under the 2016 Plan, including shares available to be granted as restricted stock. 
 
 Under the 2016 Plan, the vesting date for each option award or restricted stock award is determined by an award committee and specified in the award agreement. In the case of restricted stock awards granted in lieu of cash payments of directors fees, the grant date is used as the vesting date unless the award agreement provides otherwise.

 Stock Options 
 
 Under the 2008 Plan, stock option awards were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of First Financial Northwest s common stock at the grant date. These option awards have a vesting period of , with vesting on the anniversary date of each grant date, and a contractual life of . Any unexercised stock options expire after the grant date, or sooner in the event of the award recipient s death, disability or termination of service with the Company. At September 30, 2024, there were stock options from the 2008 Plan vested and available for exercise, subject to the 2008 Plan provisions.

 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes model that uses the following assumptions. The dividend yield is based on the current quarterly dividend in effect at the time of the grant. Historical employment data is used to estimate the forfeiture rate. The historical volatility of the Company s stock price over a specified period of time is used for the expected volatility assumption. First Financial Northwest bases the risk-free interest rate on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity Indices in effect on the date of the grant. First Financial Northwest elected to use the Share-Based Payments method permitted by the SEC to calculate the expected term. This method uses the vesting term of an option along with the contractual term, setting the expected life at the midpoint. 
 
 Under certain conditions, a cashless exercise of vested stock options may occur by the option holder surrendering the number of options valued at the current stock price at the time of exercise to cover the total cost to exercise. The surrendered options are canceled and are unavailable for reissue.

Overview 
 
 First Financial Northwest Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest and, as such, comprises substantially all of the activity for the Company. The Bank was a community-based savings bank until February 4, 2016, when it converted to a Washington chartered commercial bank reflecting the commercial banking services it now provides to its customers. The Bank primarily serves King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Kitsap counties, Washington, through its full-service 
 38 

banking office and headquarters in Renton, Washington, as well as seven retail branches in King County, Washington, five retail branches in Snohomish County, Washington, and two retail branches in Pierce County, Washington. 
 
 The Bank s business consists predominantly of attracting deposits from the general public, combined with borrowing from the FHLB and raising funds in the wholesale market, then utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business and consumer loans. Additionally, we anticipate that construction/land lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction/land lending by concentrating our efforts on residential loans to builders known to us, including multifamily loans to developers with proven success in this type of construction. These loans typically mature in 12 to 24 months and funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, therefore the impact to net loans receivable is generally minimal in the short term. We have also geographically expanded our loan portfolio through purchases of consumer classic and collectible car loans that are outside of our primary market area. During the first nine months of 2024, loan repayments outpaced newly funded loans, refinances and purchases, resulting in a decrease of 49.8 million in net loans receivable at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our strategic initiatives seek to diversify our loan portfolio and broaden growth opportunities within our current risk tolerance levels and asset/liability objectives. In this regard, our portfolio at September 30, 2024, included 135.3 million of loans to borrowers or secured by properties in 47 other states and the District of Columbia, with the largest concentrations of loans outside our primary market area located in California, Oregon, Texas, Florida and Alabama totaling 29.3 million, 10.3 million, 10.2 million, 10.0 million and 7.6 million, respectively. 
 
 The Bank has affiliated with a Small Business Administration SBA partner to process our SBA loans while the Bank retains the credit decisions. This enables us to be active in lending to small businesses until our volumes are high enough to support the investment in necessary infrastructure. When volumes support our becoming a SBA preferred lender, we will apply for that status which would provide the Bank with delegated loan approval as well as closing and most servicing and liquidation authority, enabling the Bank to make loan decisions more rapidly. In addition, the Bank is strategically broadening its commercial business lending offerings, encompassing products like business lines of credit, business term loans, and equipment financing. This expansion aims to enhance loan portfolio diversity, draw in business deposits, and bolster revenue generation. Moreover, it seeks to contribute to local economic development and cultivate enduring client relationships. 
 
 Our primary source of revenue is interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments. Interest expense is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Changes in levels of interest rates affect interest income and interest expense differently and, thus, impact our net interest income and net interest margin. The Bank is currently liability-sensitive, meaning our interest-earning liabilities re-price at a faster rate than our interest-bearing assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin decreased 23 basis points to 2.46 , compared to 2.69 in the same quarter last year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased, primarily due to an increase in market interest rates. For the same reason, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities also increased, but at a faster pace than the average yield on interest-earning assets. 
 
 Income is also affected by the provision for credit losses, or the recapture of the provision for credit losses, which affects the level of our allowance for credit losses ACL ). The ACL is an estimate of the expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost using relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. As our loan portfolio increases, or due to an increase for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, our ACL may increase, resulting in a decrease to net interest income after the provision. Improvements in loan risk ratings, increases in property values, or receipt of recoveries of amounts previously charged off may partially or fully offset any required increase to ACL due to loan growth or an increase in probable credit losses. 
 
 Noninterest income is generated from various loan and deposit fees, increases in the cash surrender value of BOLI, revenue earned on our wealth management services, and other income. This income is increased or partially offset by any net gain or loss on sales of investment securities. 
 
 Our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, regulatory assessments, occupancy and equipment, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, including commissions and bonuses, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits. Professional fees include legal services, auditing and accounting services, computer 
 39 

support services, and other professional services, including those in support of the proposed Global transaction and other strategic plans. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease expenses, real estate taxes, depreciation expenses, maintenance, and costs of utilities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section within Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. The SEC defines "critical accounting estimates" as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. The Company's critical accounting estimates include those related to the calculation of the ACL. There have not been any material changes in the Company s critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Total assets were 1.45 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 54.0 million or 3.6 , from 1.51 billion at December 31, 2023. The following table details the net change in the composition of our assets at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023.

 Interest-earning deposits with banks. Interest-earning deposits with banks, consisting primarily of funds held at the FRB, increased 50.7 million to 72.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 22.1 million at December 31, 2023. Due to a decline in loan demand and not reinvesting of proceeds from investment maturities, we had excess funds, which were deposited to our interest-earning overnight accounts. These funds are readily available to use for meeting our financial obligations. 
 
 Investments available-for-sale. Investments available-for-sale decreased 51.3 million, primarily due to the maturity of 40.0 million of investments during the first nine months of 2024. No investment securities were purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Proceeds from investment maturities were used to supplement our funding needs, including paying off brokered deposits as they matured. 
 
 The effective duration of the investments available-for-sale at September 30, 2024 was 3.88 , compared to 3.43 at December 31, 2023. Effective duration measures the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment security (or portfolio) in the ev ent of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank s portfolio includes securities with 
 40 

embedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management believes that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank s investment securities portfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow assumptions as interest rates change. 
 
 Loans receivable. Net loans receivable decreased 49.8 million, or 4.2 , to 1.13 billion at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, reflecting decreases in all loan categories. Decreases in commercial real estate, business, one-to-four family residential, multifamily, consumer and construction/land loans were 14.8 million, 14.7 million, 12.4 million, 5.3 million, 975,000 and 703,000 respectively. The decreases in our balances were attributable to shifts in the interest rate environment, and fewer opportunities for lending activities. Additionally, we spent a significant amount of time during the second quarter of 2024 modifying loans under the P A Agreement, which had an adverse impact on new loan production. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, construction/land loans total e d 36.8 and 38.3 of total capital plus surplus, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled 296.2 and 316.8 of total capital plus surplus, respectively. The Bank has set aggregate concentration guidelines for total commercial real estate, residential, non-owner occupied, multifamily and construction/land loans of up to 550 of total capital plus surplus. Our concentration guideline for construction/land loans is to limit these loans to 100 of total capital plus surplus. The concentration of construction/land loans is calculated using the funded balance of these loans and consequently can fluctuate based on the timing of construction draws and loan payoffs. Management reviews estimated construction draws and loan payoffs and adjusts loan originations based on these estimates to achieve compliance with our construction guidelines. Our commercial and multifamily real estate and construction/land loan portfolios are subject to ongoing credit reviews performed by both independent loan review staff, as well as an external third-party review firm to assist with identifying potential adverse trends and risks in the portfolio allowing management to initiate timely corrective action, as necessary. Such reviews also assist with ensuring loan risk grades are accurately assigned and thereby properly accounted for in the ACL. The review places emphasis on large borrowing relationships, stress testing, compliance with loan covenants, as well as other risk factors warranting enhanced review.

The following table presents a breakdown of our multifamily residential, commercial real estate and construction/land loans by collateral type at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Total construction/land loans are net of 59.3 million and 44.6 million of loans-in-process LIP ), at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 To assist in our strategic initiatives for loan growth and geographic diversification, the Bank originates and purchases loans and utilizes loan participations with the underlying collateral located within areas of Washington State but outside our primary market area as well as in other states. The Bank s goal with respect to loan participations is to locate a selling bank that is unable to make an entire loan due to legal or lending concentration limitations. Sellers of these loans are reviewed for management/lending experience, financial condition, asset quality metrics, and regulatory matters. Loans acquired through participation or purchase must meet the Bank s underwriting and risk guidelines. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank purchased 11.4 million of loans and loan participations located in Washington and other states, consisting of 11.1 million of consumer loans secured by classic/collectible automobiles, 276,000 of commercial real estate loans and 49,000 of multifamily residential loans. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the majority of our loan portfolio was secured by properties located in our primary market area; however, a significant amount of loans was secured by properties located in areas of Washington outside our primary market area and elsewhere. Specifically, at September 30, 2024, loans secured by properties outside our primary market area accounted for 7.2 of total loans in Washington, 2.6 in California and 9.3 across regions outside of both California and Washington. The following table details geographic concentrations in our loan portfolio:

 _______________ 
 (1) Includes loa ns in Oregon, Texas, Florida and Alabama of 10.3 million, 10.2 million, 10.0 million and 7.6 million, respectively, and 67.9 million of loans located in 42 other states and the District of Columbia. 
 
 The ACL increased 959,000 to 16.3 million at September 30, 2024, representing 1.42 of total loans receivable, from 15.3 million, representing 1.29 of total loans receivable at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a significant decrease in appraised values on two participation commercial loans (one lending relationship) with balances totaling 6.0 million, shifts in the compositions of the loan portfolio, credit rating changes, changes in the unemployment rate forecasts and an increase in balances of the multifamily construction/land and commercial construction/land development loans. 
 
 We believe the ACL was adequate to absorb the expected losses in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the ACL are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will be proven correct in the future, that the actual amount of future losses will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the ACL may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances, or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ACL is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. Uncertainties relating to our ACL are heightened as a result of the risks surrounding economic forecasts and risks inherent in the business environment as described in further detail in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q and Part 1, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Asset Quality. Loans are considered past due if a scheduled principal or interest payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Past due loans totaled 2.2 million and 1.4 million, or 0.20 and 0.12 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively . We had no other real estate owned properties or foreclosed assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans totaled 853,000, or 0.07 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 220,000, or 0.01 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonaccrual loans was due partly to management placing a 279,000 one-to-four family residential loan that was 60 days past due on nonaccrual status and a 352,000 consumer loan that was more than 90 days past due becoming nonaccrual. 
 
 We will continue to focus our efforts on working with borrowers to bring any past due loans cur rent. By taking ownership of the underlying collateral if needed, we can generally convert non-earning assets into earning assets on a more timely basis than may otherwise be the case.

 (1) All certificates of deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 95.3 million of certificates of deposits, 25.1 million of interest-bearing demand deposits and 10.4 million of network money market deposits at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Deposits decreased 26.8 million to 1.17 billion as of September 30, 2024, down from 1.19 billion at December 31, 2023. This decline was primarily the result of a 116.7 million decrease in the aggregate of brokered deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts and interest-bearing demand accounts, partially offset by a 90.3 million increase in retail certificates of deposits. During the first nine months of 2024, management chose to reduce the reliance on funds from the wholesale markets due to a decrease in the loan portfolio and overall loan demand. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 80.0 million and 85.8 million in public funds, respectively, primarily in retail certificates of deposit and money market accounts. 
 
 Advances. We use advances from the FHLB as an alternative funding source to manage interest rate risk, to leverage our balance sheet and to supplement our deposits. FHLB advances totaled 100.0 million and 125.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, FHLB advances consisted of 75.0 million of fixed-rate one-month advances that renew monthly and 25.0 million of fixed-rate three-month advances that renew quarterly. These one- and three-month advances are utilized in cash flow hedge agreements as described below. At September 30, 2024, all of our FHLB advances were due to reprice within a month. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedge. To assist in our interest rate risk management efforts, the Bank has entered into multiple interest rate swap agreements with qualified institutions. Each interest rate swap agreement qualifies as a cash flow hedge of the variability of future interest payments attributable to the changes in one-month or three-month SOFR. The objective of the cash flow hedge is to offset the variability of cash flows due to the rollover of the Bank s FHLB, or other advances, for one-month or three-months, respectively, for the term of the agreement. 
 
 The following table presents details of the Bank s interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024. For each interest rate swap agreement listed, the Bank has secured a FHLB advance for the notional amount that matures and is subject to repricing at the same frequency as the corresponding interest rate swap. The Bank pays a fixed interest rate to the counterparty and in return, receives a floating interest rate based on the index noted in the table below. The original terms of these interest rate swap agreements range from two to eight years. These cash flow hedge agreements had a weighted average remaining term of 30.8 months and a weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.93 as of September 30, 2024.

 A change in the net fair value of these cash flow hedges is recognized as an other asset or other liability on the balance sheet with the tax-effected portion of the change included in other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recognized fair value assets of 5.2 million and 7.6 million, respectively, as a result of the increase in market value of the interest rate swap agreements. 
 
 Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity decreased to 160.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 161.7 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in stockholders equity resulted from a net loss of 128,000, the payment of 2.4 million of cash dividends to stockholders and a 1.2 million decrease to additional paid-in-capital from the cancellation of 55,714 shares of stock awards during the first nine months of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by a 1.2 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, resulting from the increase in fair value of our available-for-sale investments, and a 1.1 million increase in additional paid-in-capital resulting from 195,000 in stock-based compensation recognized over the vesting periods of the stock awards and 889,000 from the exercise of 82,500 shares of stock options.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. A net loss of 608,000 was reported for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or (0.07) per diluted share compared to net income of 1.5 million, or 0.16 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.1 million decrease in net income was due to a 1.2 million decrease in net interest income and a 1.9 million increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 282,000 decrease in noninterest expense and a 733,000 decrease in the federal income tax provision. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.2 million to 8.5 million from 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from decreases in average balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest expense on deposits and borrowings, primarily reflecting the higher market interest rates and continued intense competition for deposits. Between March 2022 and January 2024, in response to continuing elevated inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates a total of 11 times, to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 until September 18, 2024, when the rates were reduced to the range of 4.75 to 5.00 . 
 
 Interest income decreased 259,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. While interest income benefited from the repricing impact of the higher interest rate environment on variable rate asset yields, the reduction in interest income resulting from decreases in average balances of these interest-earning assets outpaced the increase in yields. Interest income on loans decreased 260,000 due to a decrease in the average loan balances, partially offset by an increase in loan yields. The average balance of loans decreased 40.0 million to 1.13 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.17 billion for the same period in 2023. Average loan yield increased to 5.86 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due in large part to increased returns from the repricing of variable rate loans. 
 
 Interest income from investment securities decreased 374,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to a 50.1 million decrease in the average balance of these securities, partially offset by a 32 basis point increase in the average yield to 4.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.98 for the same period in 2023, as higher market interest rates favorably impacted our variable rate investment securities. 
 
 Interest income on interest-earning deposits with banks increased 338,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a 24.9 million increase in the average balance and a nine basis point increase in the average yield to 5.27 on these deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.18 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest expense increased 990,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to interest expense on deposits increasing 543,000 and interest expense on borrowings increasing 447,000. The increase in the interest expense on deposits was primarily due to an increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, in particular higher yielding money market accounts and retail certificates of deposit, which increased 68 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively, and, to a lesser extent, the higher average balance of money market accounts and retail certificates of deposits. The average rate paid on money market accounts and retail certificates was 3.71 and 4.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.03 and 3.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of money market accounts and retail certificates of deposit increased 34.2 million and 38.8 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the interest expenses on brokered and interest-bearing demand deposits. The decrease in interest expense on brokered deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the average balance of brokered deposits decreasing 124.3 million, as we reduced the use of brokered deposits as a funding source due to lower loan originations and the growth in retail certificates of deposit, partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in average cost to 5.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense on demand deposits was due primarily to a 22.6 million decrease in average balance combined with a 129 basis point decrease in average cost to 0.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.48 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense on borrowings increased 447,000 as a result of a 26.1 million increase in the average balance and a 77 basis point increase in average cost of borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 46 

The Company s net interest margin was 2.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the increased yields on interest-earning assets, with a 48 basis points increase in our average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 3.72 from 3.24 , partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets to 5.66 from 5.46 between periods, respectively. For more information, see How We Measure the Interest Rate Changes in Item 3 of this report. 
 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods indicated. Information is provided with respect to: (1) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); and (2) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Changes in rate/volume are allocated proportionately to the changes in rate and volume.

 Provision for Credit Losses. Management recognizes that credit losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ACL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of loans in the portfolio. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses has two basic components: first, a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics and second, an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans. Management performs individual evaluation for loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans. Based on this individually evaluated analysis, if the recorded investment in the loan is more than the market value of the collateral less costs to sell market value ), a specific allowance is established in the ACL for the loan. The amount of the specific allowance is computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This analysis is inherently subjective as it relies on estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. 
 48 

The Company s methodology is to build a reserve rate using historical life of loan default rates combined with assessment of current loan portfolio information, forecasted economic environment and business cycle information. The Company uses statistical analysis to determine the life of loan default and loss rates for the quantitative component and analyzes qualitative factors Q-Factors that assess the current loan portfolio conditions and forecasted economic environment. The Q-Factors adjust the expected loss rates for current and forecasted conditions that are not fully provided for in the historical loss information. The Company has established a methodology for adjusting the previously determined expected loss rates based on the more recent or forecasted changes. The Q-Factor methodology is based on a blend of quantitative analysis and management judgement and reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
 
 The Company also records an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments on a quarterly basis. We estimate expected credit losses on unfunded loan commitments in which we are exposed to credit risk, unless we have the option to unconditionally cancel the obligation. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, management evaluated the adequacy of the ACL and concluded that a net provision for credit losses of 1.6 million was appropriate, with 1.5 million allocated to loans and 75,000 allocated to unfunded commitments. This provision mainly relates to two participation loans totaling 6.0 million, for which we are not the lead lender. These loans, secured by short-term rehabilitation and assisted living facilities, have been individually evaluated and classified as substandard since March 2022 due to a decline in demand for the services provided at such facilities post-COVID. While payments on the loans were current as of September 30, 2024, updated appraisals received during the quarter resulted in an increase in our ACL. The loan guarantors are under contract to sell another property, with the sale expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Proceeds from this sale are expected to be applied to the two loans, which would improve our position. Additionally, the guarantors reported interest from a national real estate developer in purchasing one of the facilities, though no purchase agreement was entered into as of September 30, 2024. The ACL was also impacted by higher forecasted unemployment rates and increased construction and land development loan balances. In comparison, a 300,000 recapture of provision for credit losses was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The recapture was due to the payoff of a 4.6 million commercial real estate loan that carried a higher credit risk rating, a credit upgrade to an 8.7 million commercial real estate loan and reduction in loans receivable during that quarter. For more information, see Note 5 - Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses in the Company s Selected Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income was 677,000 for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following table provides a summary of the changes in the components of noninterest income: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) BOLI income 295 244 51 20.9 Wealth management revenue 42 53 (11) (20.8) Deposit related fees 236 247 (11) (4.5) Loan related fees 96 79 17 21.5 Other 8 54 (46) (85.2) Total noninterest income 677 677 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, BOLI income increased 51,000 primarily as a result of annual premiums and dividends and loan related fees increased 17,000, primarily due to forfeitures collected from loan application deposits. Offsetting these increases was an 11,000 decrease in wealth management revenue primarily due to decreased sales of products and services, an 11,000 decrease in deposit related fees primarily due to lower debit card related fees reflecting decreased usage and a 46,000 decrease in other noninterest income primarily due to a 44,000 distribution received from our investment in a Fintech focused fund in the third quarter of 2023, and no such distribution received in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased 282,000 to 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 49 

The following table provides a summary of the changes in the components of noninterest expense: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 4,606 5,018 (412) (8.2) Occupancy and equipment 1,183 1,193 (10) (0.8) Professional fees 585 553 32 5.8 Data processing 838 742 96 12.9 Regulatory assessments 165 200 (35) (17.5) Insurance and bond premiums 113 111 2 1.8 Marketing 46 97 (51) (52.6) Other general and administrative 952 856 96 11.2 Total noninterest expense 8,488 8,770 (282) (3.2) 
 
 The decrease in noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a 412,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, resulting primarily from the receipt of a 411,000 refund related to the defined benefit plan buyout following a census review of remaining plan participants, a 51,000 decrease in marketing expense, a 35,000 decrease in regulatory assessments and a 10,000 decrease in occupancy and equipment expense. Offsetting these decreases was a 32,000 increase in professional fees and a 96,000 increase in both data processing and other general and administrative expense. The increase in data processing fees was primarily due to a 66,000 vendor credit received during the third quarter of 2023, with no similar vendor credit in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in other general and administrative expense was primarily attributed to the 115,000 higher administrative fees of some deposit products, partially offset by a 23,000 decrease in state and local taxes. 
 
 Federal Income Tax Expense. A federal income tax benefit of 324,000 was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a result of a pretax loss for the quarter, compared to a federal income tax provision of 409,000 for the same period in 2023. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. Net loss of 128,000 was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 0.01) per diluted share, compared to net income of 5.1 million, or 0.56 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 5.2 million decrease in net income was primarily the result of a 4.9 million decrease in net interest income, a 1.4 million increase in provision for credit losses and a 531,000 increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 1.6 million decrease in federal income tax provision. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.3 million, compared to 31.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to the increase in interest expense outpacing the increase in interest income between these comparative periods. 
 
 Interest income increased by 503,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to a 634,000 increase in interest income on loans, a 450,000 increase in interest-earning deposits with banks and a 56,000 increase in dividends on FHLB stock, partially offset by a 637,000 decrease in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income on loans was due to an increase in loan yields, partially offset by a decrease in average loan balance. The average yield on loans increased to 5.89 in the nine months ended September 30. 2024, compared to 5.67 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average loan yield was primarily the result of variable rate loans repricing at higher interest rates and the modification of over 130 million of loans in accordance with terms in the P A Agreement with Global, which positively impacted the yield on loans in the current period. The average balance of loans decreased 30.8 million to 1.14 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.17 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The 637,000 decrease in interest income on investment securities was a result of a 36.7 million decrease in the average balance of the securities primarily due to maturities that were not reinvested, partially offset by a 33 basis point 
 50 

increase in the average yield of investment to 4.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.93 for the same period in 2023. The 450,000 increase in interest income on interest-earning deposits with was due to a 36 basis point increase in the average yield to 5.27 and 8.8 million increase in the average balance on these deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Interest expense increased 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2323, due to the increase in rates paid on money market accounts and retail certificates of deposit and to a less extent, an increase in the average balances of such deposit accounts. Interest expense on money market accounts increased 4.4 million due to a 98 basis point increase in average cost and a 30.1 million increase in average balance between periods. Similarly, interest expense on retail certificates of deposit increased 4.4 million, due to increases in both average balance and average yield. The average yield of these deposits increased 128 basis points to 4.20 and the average balance increased 34.4 million between the comparable periods. Partially offsetting these increases was a 2.8 million decrease in interest expense on brokered deposits and a 877,000 decrease in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits. The decrease in interest expense on brokered deposits was due to an 83.4 million decrease in average balance, partially offset by a 43 basis point increase to average cost to 5.37 on these deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.94 for the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank reduced the use of higher cost brokered deposits due to the increase in the balance of retail certificates of deposit, decline in loans receivable and lower loan originations. The decrease in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits was due to decreases in both the average cost and average balance of these deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing demand deposits decreased to 0.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.48 for the same period in 2023 and the average balance decreased 30.6 million between the comparable periods. 
 
 Interest expense on borrowings increased 413,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a combined result of a 6.1 million increase in average balance between comparable periods and a 29 basis point increase to the average cost to 2.85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.56 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Company s net interest margin decreased to 2.56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in interest expense outpacing the increase in interest income, as outlined above. For more information on this, see How We Measure the Risk of Interest Rate Changes in Item 3 of this Form 10-Q.

 Provision for Credit Losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management evaluated the adequacy of the ACL and concluded that a 1.2 million provision for credit losses was appropriate, reflecting a 1.0 million provision for credit losses for loans and a 200,000 provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments. This provision mainly relates to two participation loans totaling 6.0 million, for which we are not the lead lender, as discussed under Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 - Provision for Credit Losses above. The 200,000 provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments was primarily due to the increased construction and land development loan balances. In comparison, a 208,000 recapture of provision for credit losses was recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 400,000 recapture of the provision for credit losses for loans and a 192,000 provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments. The recapture was due in part to changes in the balances and mix of portfolio loans during the period, credit upgrades to 10.8 million of commercial real estate loans, the payoff of a 4.6 million commercial real estate loan that carried a higher credit risk rating, and changes in the economic forecasts used for loans and unfunded commitments in the ACL model.

Noninterest Income. Total noninterest income was 2.1 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) 
 BOLI income 
 956 826 130 15.7 Wealth management revenue 
 190 193 (3) (1.6) Deposit related fees 
 697 722 (25) (3.5) Loan related fees 
 251 215 36 16.7 Other 
 43 184 (141) (76.6) Total noninterest income 
 2,137 2,140 (3) (0.1) 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other noninterest income decreased 141,000, primarily due to 152,000 of lower unrealized gains recorded for our investment in a Fintech focused fund. Additionally, deposit related fees decreased 25,000, primarily due to lower card service fees attributed to decreased debit card usage. These decreases were partially offset by a 130,000 increase in BOLI income due to timing differences in the recognition of the cash value of the policies and a 36,000 increase in loan related fees. The increase in loan related fees was primarily due to 121,000 in miscellaneous loan fees largely the result of forfeitures collected for loan application deposits, partially offset by a 70,000 decrease in prepayment fees collected on certain loans paid off prior to maturity and a 12,000 decrease in line of credit annual fees. 
 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 531,000 to 27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 27.2 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) 
 Salaries and employee benefits 
 15,186 15,543 (357) (2.3) Occupancy and equipment 
 3,634 3,517 117 3.3 Professional fees 
 2,635 1,857 778 41.9 Data processing 
 2,480 2,139 341 15.9 Regulatory assessments 
 502 568 (66) (11.6) Insurance and bond premiums 
 363 356 7 2.0 Marketing 
 155 273 (118) (43.2) Other general and administrative 
 2,804 2,975 (171) (5.7) Total noninterest expense 
 27,759 27,228 531 2.0 
 
 The largest increase in noninterest expense was in professional fees, which increased by 778,000. This was primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses from the Global transaction, which totaled 815,000 more than the acquisition expenses for a terminated business combination during the same period in 2023. Additionally, audit and examination fees increased by 25,000 due to a one-time loan portfolio review, but this was partially offset by a 78,000 reduction in other legal fees. 
 
 Data processing expense increased by 341,000, primarily due to the reclassification of certain processing costs that were previously categorized under other general and administrative expenses. Starting in March 2024, we also became ineligible for certain vendor credits, which contributed to higher data processing costs. For the nine months ended 
 55 

September 30, 2024, total credits received were 22,000, compared to 106,000 for the same period in 2023. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by 117,000, largely due to the outsourcing of facility management duties. 
 
 Offsetting these increases, salaries and employee benefits decreased by 357,000. This reduction was primarily driven by an 873,000 decline in deferred loan origination costs, related to the modification of one-to-four family residential loans under the P A Agreement with Global, a 320,000 reduction in compensation from restricted stock awards, and a 256,000 decrease in salaries and wages due to a reduction in staffing in 2024. These decreases were partially offset by a 918,000 increase in defined benefit expenses, primarily due to the purchase of a single premium group annuity to fulfill obligations to plan participants and a 152,000 increase in director compensation. Additionally, regulatory assessments decreased 66,000, marketing expense decreased 118,000 and other general and administrative expenses decreased by 171,000, largely due to the absence of a 190,000 one-time expense related to the Bank s 100-year celebration in the second quarter of 2023, as well as the reclassification of core processing costs. 
 
 Federal Income Tax Expense. The federal income tax provision decreased 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 6.9 million decrease in pretax income as a net loss of 128,000 was reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We are required to have sufficient sources of cash in order to maintain proper liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. We maintain liquidity above the minimum level that we believe to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows. On a daily basis, we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained. 
 
 Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits, scheduled loan and investment repayments, including interest payments, maturing loans and investment securities, advances from the FHLB, brokered deposits and deposits obtained in the national CD and internet markets. These funds, together with equity, are used to fund loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We believe that our current liquidity position, and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments. 
 
 Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments such as overnight deposits or other short-term investment securities. On a longer-term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, to pay maturing certificates of deposit and withdrawals on other deposit accounts, to fund loan commitments, and to maintain our portfolio of investment securities. At September 30, 2024, the undisbursed portion of construction LIP and unused portion of lines of credit totaled 59.3 million and 51.5 million, respectively. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at September 30, 2024, totaled 381.8 million. Management s policy is generally to maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on historical experience, we believe that a significant portion of maturing certificates of deposit will remain with the Bank. 
 
 We measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due. Liquidity (and funding) risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices or in a reasonable time frame to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations. We regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage effectively our liquidity and funding requirements. 
 
 When retail deposits are not sufficient to provide the funds for our assets, or if other sources are available with more favorable rates or structure, we use alternative funding sources. These sources include, but are not limited to, advances from the FHLB, wholesale funding, brokered deposits, national CD markets, internet deposit gathering sources, federal funds purchased, and dealer repurchase agreements, as well as other short-term alternatives. We may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs. During the first nine months of 2024, management reduced its reliance in the wholesale markets due to a decline in the loan portfolio balances and an increase in the balance of retail certificates of deposit. At September 30, 2024, we had 50.9 million in brokered deposits, all of which were certificates of deposit, down from 130.8 million in brokered deposits at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained credit facilities with the FHLB totaling 506.5 million, subject to qualifying collateral limits that reduced our pledged collateral borrowing capacity to 418.6 million, with an outstanding balance of 100.0 million. As further funding sources, we also had the ability to borrow 54.9 million from the 
 56 

FRB, and 75.0 million from unused lines of credit with other financial institutions, with no balance outstanding from these sources at September 30, 2024. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1 of this report. 
 
 On a monthly basis we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the next twelve months. Also, we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits. This information is used by our Asset/Liability Management Committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities. 
 
 We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations. Based on our current capital allocation objectives, during the remainder of fiscal 2024 we expect cash expenditures of approximately 145,000 for capital investment in property, plant and equipment. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we project that our fixed commitments for the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, will include (i) 230,000 of operating lease payments and (ii) other future obligations and accrued expenses of 20.8 million. At September 30 , 2024, we had 100.0 million in FHLB advances, consisting of 75.0 million of fixed-rate one-month advances that renew monthly and 25.0 million of fixed-rate three-month advances that renew quarterly. At September 30, 2024, all of our FHLB advances were tied to interest rate swap agreements and these advances are expected to be renewed as they mature during 2024. W e believe that our liquid assets combined with the available lines of credit provide adequate liquidity to meet our current financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Total stockholders equity wa s 160.2 million at September 30, 2024. Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, we actively seek to maintain the Bank as a well capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulat ory capital requirements. Regulatory capital ratios for the Bank as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: Total capital to risk-weighted assets was 16.68 ; Tier 1 capital and Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 15.43 ; and Tier 1 capital to total assets was 10.86 . At September 30, 2024, the Bank met the financial ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory guidelines. In addition, the Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional Common equity Tier 1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum regulatory capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. At September 30, 2024 , the Bank s capital conservation buffer was 8.68 . See Item 1. Business How We Are Regulated Regul ation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank Capital Requirements included in the 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements for the Bank. 
 
 The Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI component of capital includes a variety of items, including the value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio and the value of our derivative instruments, net of tax. We model various interest rate scenarios that could impact these elements of AOCI and believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand the estimated potential fluctuations in a variety of interest rate environments. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 General. Our Board of Directors has approved an asset/liability management policy to guide management in maximizing interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity, capital adequacy, interest rate risk, credit risk, and profitability. The policy established the Investment, Asset/Liability Committee ALCO ), which is comprised of certain members of senior management and the Board of Directors. The Committee s purpose is to communicate, coordinate and manage our asset/liability position consistent with our business plan and Board-approved policies. The ALCO meets quarterly to review various areas including: 
 
 economic conditions; 
 interest rate outlook; 
 57 

asset/liability mix; 
 interest rate risk sensitivity; 
 current market opportunities to promote specific products; 
 historical financial results; 
 projected financial results; and 
 capital position. 
 The ALCO also reviews current and projected liquidity needs. As part of its procedures, the ALCO regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity, which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in the market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the Board of Directors. 
 
 Our Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. 
 
 We have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk: 
 we are originating shorter term higher yielding loans, whenever possible; 
 we have attempted, where possible, to increase balances of non-maturity deposits that are less interest rate sensitive; 
 we invest in securities with relatively short average lives, generally less than eight years; 
 we have added adjustable-rate loans to our loan portfolio; 
 we utilize brokered certificates of deposit with a call option as a funding source; and 
 we utilize interest rate swaps to effectively fix the rate on certain FHLB advances. 
 We have evaluated the use of derivative instruments to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our cost of borrowing while considering various elements of interest rate risk. We use interest rate swaps which qualify as a cash flow hedge as a tool to lower the cost of certain FHLB advances as compared to the fixed rates offered by the FHLB for its longer-term advances. At September 30, 2024, the Bank held seven interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 100.0 million, a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 1.93 , and weighted average remaining maturity of 31 months. Under the interest rate agreements, the Bank pays a fixed interest rate while it receives a floating rate tied to either the 1-month or 3-month SOFR, aligning with each agreement s reset frequency over an original term of two to eight years. At the commencement of each interest rate agreement, the Bank secures a fixed rate FHLB advance which resets to market rate on the same cycle as the corresponding interest rate swap agreement. Entering into these agreements has allowed the Bank to secure fixed rate funding at a lower cost than a traditional fixed rate FHLB advance for comparable terms. We will continue to review similar instruments and may continue to utilize them for interest rate risk management in the future. 
 
 Interest rate contracts, however, may expose us to the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the interest rate contract and the hedged item. In addition, these contracts carry volatility risk that the expected uncertainty relating to the price of the underlying asset differs from what is anticipated. If any interest rate swap we enter into proves ineffective, it could result in volatility in our operating results, including potential losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may determine that it is appropriate to unwind some or all of our derivative instruments, based on our assessments of the continued appropriateness of our balance sheet risks and derivative positions. 
 
 How We Measure the Risk of Interest Rate Changes. We monitor our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis by measuring the impact of changes to net interest income in multiple rate environments. Management retains the services of a third-party consultant with over 30 years of experience in asset-liability management to assist in its interest rate risk and asset-liability management. Management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates. Although management believes these assumptions are reasonable, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual results differ from these assumptions. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of 
 58 

repricing, they may react differently to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates. Non-uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, a portion of our adjustable-rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan s contractual interest rate may not adjust. Approximately 62.1 of our net loans were adjustable-rate loans at September 30, 2024. At that date, 396.1 million, or 55.9 , of these loans, with a weighted-average rate of 4.96 , were at their floor interest rate. 
 
 The inability of our loans to adjust downward with the presence of floors can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates, although this result is subject to the risk that borrowers may refinance these loans during periods of declining interest rates. Also, when loans are at their respective floors, there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure. 
 
 The assumptions we use to monitor interest rate risk are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions. These assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayments, deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios. We use market data to determine prepayments and maturities of loans, investments and borrowings and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits. Time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities. We also assume that non-maturity deposit rates can be maintained with rate adjustments proportionate to the change in market interest rates, based upon our historical deposit decay rates, which are lower than market decay rates. When interest rates rise, we assume we will not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits. These assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base, competitive factors and historical experience. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, however, prepayment and early withdrawal levels might deviate from those assumed. 
 
 Our income simulation model examines changes in net interest income in which interest rates were assumed to remain at their base level, with instantaneous increases and decreases of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points. 
 
 The following table illustrates the estimated change in our net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2024, that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities, with no effect given to any steps that the Bank might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement. 
 
 Net Interest Income Change at September 30, 2024 Basis Point Change in Rates Net Interest Income Change (Dollars in thousands) 400 33,891 (7.36) 300 34,586 (5.46) 200 35,247 (3.66) 100 35,969 (1.68) Base 36,585 (100) 37,034 1.23 (200) 39,416 7.74 (300) 37,847 3.45 (400) 38,195 4.40 
 
 The net interest income table presented above is predicated upon a static balance sheet with no growth or material change in asset or liability mix. The effects of changes in interest rates are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and assuming that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Delinquency rates may change when interest rates change as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix, underwriting conditions, loan terms or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed 
 59 

effect on the portfolio. Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities will perform as assumed. Also, a change in U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the Treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net interest income other than those indicated above. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, other than the interest rate swap agreements we have entered into, we did not have any derivative financial instruments or trading accounts for any class of financial instruments, nor have we engaged in any other hedging activities or purchased off-balance sheet derivative instruments. However, we continue to review such instruments and may utilize them for interest rate risk management in the future. Interest rate risk continues to be one of our primary risks, as other types of risks, such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity pricing risk do not arise in the normal course of our business activities and operations. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 The management of First Financial Northwest, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ). A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As a result of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) and several other members of our senior management as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to our management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls: In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
