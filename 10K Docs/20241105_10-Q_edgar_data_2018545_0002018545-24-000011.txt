Overview 
 The Company is a non-diversified, externally managed closed-end management investment company focused on providing investors with access to a diversified portfolio comprised primarily of loans with equity upside investments in U.S. middle-market companies. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a REIT under Subchapter M of the Code. We were formed as a Delaware statutory trust on March 11, 2024. As a BDC and a REIT, we must comply with certain regulatory requirements. See Item 1. Business Regulation as a Business Development Company and Item 1. Business Certain U.S. Tax Considerations. 
 We are externally managed by the Advisor. Our Advisor is a limited liability company that is registered as an investment advisor under the Advisers Act. Our Advisor oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio.

Key Components of our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 The Company s investment strategy is to originate, acquire, finance and manage a portfolio of primarily CRE debt investments, focused on senior secured, CRE loans diversified across geography. The Company will focus its investments in the middle market across a diversified mix of asset classes, but maintain a focus on residential lending. It is expected that most of the borrowers will be eligible portfolio companies, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act. To a lesser extent, the Company may invest in, or originate, other real-estate related debt and equity investments, which may include subordinated debt, CMBS and CLOs. The Company believes its real estate-related debt and equity investments will help manage cash before investing subscription proceeds into investments while also seeking attractive current income. 
 The Company will seek to focus on a flexible mix of real estate investments, secured by high-quality assets to generate current cash flow. The Company seeks to identify attractive risk-reward investment opportunities by financing middle market investment companies. The Company expects to create synergies with Benefit Street Partner s commercial real estate team s existing debt sourcing capabilities by leveraging its significant scale and existing relationships to source high quality lending opportunities. 
 Before the Company has raised substantial proceeds in the offering and acquired a diversified portfolio of investments or during periods in which the Advisor determines that economic or market conditions are unfavorable to shareholders and a defensive strategy would benefit the Company, the Company may temporarily depart from its investment strategy. During these periods, subject to compliance with the 1940 Act, the Company may expand or change its investment strategy and target assets, including by investing all or any portion of its assets in U.S. government securities, including bills, notes and bonds differing as to maturity and rates of interest that are either issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by U.S. government agencies; non-U.S. government securities that have received the highest investment grade credit rating; certificates of deposit issued against funds deposited in a bank or a savings and loan association; commercial paper; bankers acceptances; fixed time deposits; shares of money market funds; credit-linked notes; repurchase agreements with respect to any of the foregoing; or any other fixed income securities that the Advisor considers consistent with this temporary strategy. 
 Senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt and equity in priority of payments and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. 
 Revenue 
 The Company generates revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments it holds. In addition, the Company generates income from dividends or distributions on income on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. The Company s debt investments generally have a stated term of two to five years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Interest on these debt investments is paid quarterly. In some instances, the Company receives payments on its debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, the Company may receive repayments of some of its debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments is expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period. The Company s portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. The Company may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.

Portfolio, Investment Activity And Results Of Operations 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had investments in twenty-two loans and two real estate securities across four industries. Based on fair value as of September 30, 2024, 100 of the Company s loan portfolio was invested in debt bearing a floating interest rate, which are primarily subject to interest rate floors. Approximately 100 of the Company s loan portfolio at fair value had an interest rate floor denoted in SOFR. The weighted average index floor across the Company s floating-rate portfolio was approximately 3.57 as of September 30, 2024. These floors allow the Company to mitigate (to a degree) any impact of spread widening on the valuation of the Company s investments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s estimated weighted average total yield of investments in loans was 8.24 . Weighted average yields are based on interest rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 As part of the monitoring process, the Advisor has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our loan investments. The Advisor has developed a classification system to group investments into five categories. The investments are evaluated regularly and assigned a category based on certain credit metrics. The Advisor s ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. Please see below for a description of the four categories of the Advisor s Internal Risk Rating system: 
 Category 1 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 1 involve the least amount of risk relative to the Company s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Category 1 investments exceed fundamental performance expectations and/or capital gain expected. Trends and risk factors since time of investment are favorable. 
 Category 2 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 2 involve a level of risk relative to the Company s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Category 2 investments are Performing consistent with expectations and a full return of principal and interest expected. Trends and risk factors are neutral to favorable. All new originated or acquired investments are initially included in Category 2. 
 Category 3 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 3 indicate that Performing investments requiring closer monitoring. Trends and risk factors show some deterioration. 
 Category 4 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 4 are underperforming investment with the potential of some interest loss but still expecting a positive return on investment. Trends and risk factors are negative. 
 Category 5 In the opinion of the Advisor, investments in Category 5 are underperforming investment with expected loss of interest and some principal.

 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 The Company intends to elect to be treated as a REIT under Subchapter M of the Code, and the Company intends to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to REITs. To qualify for tax treatment as a REIT, the Company must, among other things, distribute to the Company s shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our Investment Company Taxable Income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain the Company s tax treatment as a REIT, the Company, among other things, intends to make the requisite distributions to its shareholders, which generally relieve the Company from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not incur any excise tax. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which the Company defines as GAAP distributable earnings per the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities or the net increase in net assets resulting from operations per the Consolidated Statements of Operations (loss) adjusted for (i) net changes in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation, (ii) loan origination fees collected, (iii) accretion of income into interest income and (iv) and other one time or non-recurring charges that not related to the Company s core activities. The Company believes that Adjusted Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to the disclosed GAAP results. The Company believes Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a useful financial metric for existing and potential future holders of its Common Shares, as it believes dividends are one of the principal reasons shareholders may invest in its Common Shares. Adjusted Distributable Earnings does not represent net income (loss) and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss). The methodology for calculating Adjusted Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies and thus may not be comparable to the Adjusted Distributable Earnings reported by other similar companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP metrics to Adjusted Distributable Earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from March 11, 2024 (date of inception) to September 30, 2024:

Financial Condition, Liquidity And Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make new investments where appropriate, pay distributions to our shareholders and other general business needs. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient current liquidity and access to additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next 12 months 
 The Company generates cash from the net proceeds of offerings of its Shares, and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from its investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of its investments. The Company may also fund a portion of its investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before the Company has fully invested the proceeds of any closing of the Company s continuous private offering of its Shares. The Company s primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of Company expenses and payment of cash distributions to shareholders. 
 The Company may seek to enter into bank debt, credit facility and/or other financing arrangements on at least customary and market terms; however, such incurrence would be subject to prevailing market conditions, the Company s liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had 248.3 million of borrowings outstanding. 
 Cash Equivalents 
 The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and near their maturity such that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company deems that certain money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would qualify as cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no cash equivalents.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 Distributions and Distribution Reinvestment 
 There were no distributions for the period from March 11, 2024 (date of inception) to September 30, 2024. 
 REIT Status and Distributions 
 We intend to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2024. Furthermore, we intend to operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Code so long as our Board determines that REIT qualification remains in our best interest. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our shareholders each year dividends equal to at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction, excludes net capital gain and does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). To the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income (including net capital gain). In addition, we will incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than minimum amounts specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to make distributions to our shareholders in a manner that will satisfy the REIT 90 distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax. 
 Our Board intends to declare and pay distributions on a quarterly basis. We do not have a distribution reinvestment plan and expect to pay all distributions in cash. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our Board. 
 We may fund our cash distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds available to us, including, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gain proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gain proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we will evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The Board is responsible for overseeing the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Advisor s valuation policy. As permitted by Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Advisor as our valuation designee with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in the Advisor s valuation policy. 
 Portfolio investments are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At least quarterly, or more frequently as needed for a drawdown date, we perform an analysis of each investment to determine fair value as follows: 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is readily available according to GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined readily available, we use the quote obtained. 
 30 

Investments without a readily determined market value are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process 
 For an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, we measure the fair value of the investment predominately based on the net asset value per share of the investment fund if the net asset value of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC 946, as of our measurement date. 
 As part of our quarterly valuation process the Advisor may be assisted by one or more independent valuation firms engaged by us. The Advisor as valuation designee determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of the independent valuation firm(s) (to the extent applicable). 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Advisor undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 Each portfolio company or loan will be valued by the Advisor, potentially with assistance from one or more independent valuation firms engaged by the Board; 
 The independent valuation firm(s) conduct independent appraisals and make an independent assessment of the value of each investment; and 
 The Advisor determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of the Advisor and independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of the Board. 
 In circumstances where the Advisor deems appropriate, the Advisor s internal valuation team values certain investments. When performing the internal valuations, the Advisor utilizes similar valuation techniques as an independent third-party pricing service would use. Such valuations will be approved by an internal valuation committee of the Advisor, with oversight from the Board. 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the loans in its portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Advisor, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such loans and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following (which are defined in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements if not defined herein): 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 the Administration Agreement; and 
 the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. 
 See Item 1. Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements-Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements- Note 3 . Related Party Transactions.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Our investments are subject to a high degree of credit risk. Credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults. Default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, borrower financial condition, property performance, property management, supply/demand factors, construction trends, consumer behavior, regional economics, interest rates, the strength of the U.S. economy, and other factors beyond our control. All loans are subject to a certain probability of default. We manage credit risk through the underwriting process, acquiring our investments at the appropriate discount to face value, if any, and establishing loss assumptions. We also carefully monitor the performance of the loans, as well as external factors that may affect their value. 
 Capital Market Risk 
 We are exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under repurchase obligations or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of capital we raise. 
 Market uncertainty and volatility may cause fluctuation in market value of certain asset classes within our portfolio. We have and may continue to receive margin calls from our lenders as a result of the decline in the market value of the assets pledged by us to our lenders under our repurchase agreements and warehouse credit facilities, and if we fail to resolve such margin calls when due by payment of cash or delivery of additional collateral, the lenders may exercise remedies including demanding payment by us of our aggregate outstanding financing obligations and/or taking ownership of the loans or other assets securing the applicable obligations and liquidating them at inopportune prices. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we may borrow funds at fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. We do not have any foreign denominated investments, and thus, we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio included twenty-four variable rate investments based on SOFR (or indexing rates for various terms. The following table quantifies the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense should interest rates increase by 100, 200 or 300 basis points or decrease by 25 basis points, assuming that our current balance sheet was to remain constant, and no actions were taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity. The changes in the portfolio for each basis points increase/decrease is a change from the base scenario. 
 Change in Interest Rates Increase (Decrease) in Interest Income (Increase)/Decrease in Interest Expense Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Investment Income (-) 25 Basis Points (1,307) 602 (705) (+) 100 Basis Points 5,229 (2,408) 2,821 (+) 200 Basis Points 10,457 (4,815) 5,642 (+) 300 Basis Points 15,686 (7,223) 8,463 
 Real Estate Risk 
 The market values of commercial mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; and demographic factors. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. 
 
 32 

Inflation Risk 
 The Company is subject to inflation risk, which is the risk that the present value of the Company s assets or income will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the present value of money. The Company s dividend rates or borrowing costs, where applicable, may also increase during periods of inflation. This may further reduce Company performance. The rate of inflation in many countries worldwide has increased in recent years due to supply chain disruptions, fiscal and/or monetary stimulus, energy price increases, wage inflation, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Israel-Hamas war, among other factors. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve in the United States has raised the federal funds rate. There is no guarantee that actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other governmental bodies to reduce inflation will be effective. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
