 The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for each derivative. The Company determined that the significant inputs, such as interest yield curves and discount rates, used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and that the credit valuation adjustments associated with the Company s counterparties and its own credit risk utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Overview 
 
 We are a self-advised and self-administered Maryland REIT that owns primarily premium-branded, rooms-oriented, high-margin, focused-service and compact full-service hotels located within heart of demand locations. We own a geographically diversified portfolio of hotels located in high-growth urban markets that exhibit multiple demand generators and attractive long-term growth prospects. We believe that our investment strategy allows us to generate high levels of Revenue per Available Room ("RevPAR"), strong operating margins and attractive returns. 
 
 Our strategy is to own primarily premium-branded, rooms-oriented, high-margin, focused-service and compact full-service hotels located within heart of demand locations. Focused-service and compact full-service hotels typically generate most of their revenue from room rentals, have limited food and beverage outlets and meeting space, and require fewer employees than traditional full-service hotels. We believe these types of hotels have the potential to generate attractive returns relative to other types of hotels due to their ability to achieve RevPAR levels at or close to those achieved by traditional full-service hotels while achieving higher profit margins due to their more efficient operating model and less volatile cash flows. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 96 hotel properties with approximately 21,300 rooms, located in 23 states and the District of Columbia. We owned, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, a 100 interest in 94 of our hotel properties, a 95 controlling interest in one hotel property, and a 50 non-controlling interest in an entity owning one hotel property. We consolidate our real estate interests in the 95 hotel properties in which we hold a controlling interest, and we record the real estate interest in the one hotel property in which we hold an indirect 50 non-controlling interest using the equity method of accounting. We lease 95 of the 96 hotel properties to our TRSs, of which we own a controlling financial interest. 
 
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, we owned, through a combination of direct and indirect interests, 99.5 of the units of limited partnership interest in the OP units. 

2024 Significant Activities 
 
 Our significant activities reflect our commitment to creating long-term shareholder value through enhancing our hotel portfolio's quality, recycling capital and maintaining a prudent capital structure. The following significant activities have taken place in 2024: 
 
 Acquired a fee simple interest in the land at our Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill hotel property for approximately 125.0 million. 
 
 Exercised one-year extension options on 181.0 million in mortgage loans to extend the maturities to April 2025.

 Entered into a new 500.0 million Term Loan, the proceeds of which were used to repay our 400.0 million term loan maturing in 2025 and 100.0 million of borrowings under our Revolver. 
 
 Repurchased and retired approximately 2.3 million common shares for approximately 22.0 million. 

Our Customers 
 
 The majority of our hotels consist of premium-branded, focused-service and compact full-service hotels. As a result of this property profile, the majority of our customers are transient in nature. Transient business typically represents individual business or leisure travelers. The majority of our hotels are located in business districts within major metropolitan areas. Accordingly, business travelers represent the majority of the transient demand at our hotels. As a result, macroeconomic factors impacting business travel have a greater effect on our business than factors impacting leisure travel. 
 
 Group business is typically defined as a minimum of 10 guestrooms booked together as part of the same piece of business. Group business may or may not use the meeting space at any given hotel. Given the limited meeting space at the majority of our hotels, group business that utilizes meeting space represents a small component of our customer base. 
 
 A number of our hotel properties are affiliated with brands marketed toward extended-stay customers. Extended-stay customers are generally defined as those staying five nights or longer. 

Our Revenues and Expenses 
 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from the operation of hotels, including the sale of rooms, food and beverage revenue and other revenue, which consists of parking fees, resort fees, gift shop sales and other guest service fees. 
 
 Our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel services, including room expense, food and beverage expense, management and franchise fees and other operating expenses. Room expense includes housekeeping and front office wages and payroll taxes, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and other costs. Food and beverage expense primarily includes the cost of food, the cost of beverages and the associated labor costs. Other operating expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other operating department revenue, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, repairs and maintenance and utility costs. Our hotels that are subject to franchise agreements are charged a royalty fee, plus additional fees for marketing, central reservation systems and other franchisor costs, in order for the hotel properties to operate under the respective brands. Franchise fees are based on a percentage of room revenue and for certain hotels additional franchise fees are charged for food and beverage revenue. Our hotels are managed by independent, third-party management companies under long-term agreements pursuant to which the management companies typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel property. We generally receive a cash distribution from the management companies on a monthly basis, which reflects hotel-level sales less hotel-level operating expenses. 

Key Indicators of Financial Performance 
 
 We use a variety of operating, financial and other information to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as other financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including industry standard statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the operating performance of our individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or business as a whole. We also use these metrics to evaluate the hotels in our portfolio and potential acquisition opportunities to determine each hotel's contribution to cash flow and its potential to provide attractive long-term total returns. The key indicators include: 
 
 Average Daily Rate ("ADR") 
 Occupancy 
 RevPAR 
 ADR, Occupancy and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the lodging industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel property level and across our entire business. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a regional and company-wide basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

We also use non-GAAP measures such as FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance of our business. For a more in depth discussion of the non-GAAP measures, please refer to the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It is possible that the actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is available to us, our business and industry experience, and various other matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances. Our Annual Report contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. 

Results of Operations 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we owned 96 and 97 hotel properties, respectively. Based on when a hotel property is acquired or sold, the operating results for certain hotel properties are not comparable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The non-comparable properties include two hotel properties that were sold and one hotel property that was acquired in 2024.

 Property operating expenses increased 35.5 million to 661.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 626.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a 34.4 million increase in property operating expenses from the comparable properties. 
 
 The components of our property operating expenses for the comparable properties were as follows (in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Room expense 216,319 206,365 9,954 Food and beverage expense 87,865 81,604 6,261 Management and franchise fee expense 82,199 81,891 308 Other operating expenses 270,867 252,983 17,884 Total property operating expenses 657,250 622,843 34,407 
 
 The increase in property operating expenses from the comparable properties was primarily due to increases in wages and benefits, as well as increases in room and food and beverage expenses, and increases in other operating expenses, primarily due to increases in sales and marketing, utilities, and administrative expenses. 
 
 Property Tax, Insurance and Other 
 
 Property tax, insurance and other expense increased 4.5 million to 80.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 76.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in property taxes and insurance premiums, partially offset by the impact of successful real estate tax appeals in the current period.

General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expense decreased 1.2 million to 41.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 43.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in non-cash compensation expense. 
 
 Other Income, net 
 
 Other income, net increased 1.2 million to 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the receipt of certain COVID-19 relief awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income decreased 0.8 million to 13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable to lower average cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense increased 9.6 million to 83.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 73.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to higher interest rates on our unhedged variable rate debt combined with an increase in the amount of our debt that was unhedged. The components of our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Senior Notes 29,070 29,070 Revolver and Term Loans 37,075 23,176 13,899 Mortgage loans 10,939 15,286 (4,347) Amortization of deferred financing costs 4,779 4,528 251 Non-cash interest expense related to interest rate hedges 1,287 1,446 (159) Total interest expense 83,150 73,506 9,644 
 
 Gain (Loss) on Sale of Hotel Properties, net 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold two hotel properties for a combined sales price of approximately 20.8 million and recorded net gains on sale of approximately 8.3 million. There were no hotels sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We consider the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) EBITDA re and (5) Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of our operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as we define such terms. 
 
 Funds From Operations 
 
 We calculate funds from operations ("FFO") in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), which defines FFO as net income or loss, excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations. We believe that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs, even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders. Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing us to non-REITs. We present FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes our OP units, because our OP units may be redeemed for common shares. We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units. 
 
 We further adjust FFO for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT s definition of FFO, such as transaction costs, pre-opening costs, gains or losses on extinguishment of indebtedness, non-cash income tax expense or benefit, amortization of share-based compensation, non-cash interest expense related to discontinued interest rate hedges, derivative gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income reclassified to earnings, and certain other income or expenses that we consider outside the normal course of operations. We believe that Adjusted FFO provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and FFO, is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance. 
 
 The following table is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders and Adjusted FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 20,643 16,343 62,680 68,577 Preferred dividends (6,279) (6,279) (18,836) (18,836) Depreciation and amortization 44,892 44,727 134,045 134,648 (Gain) loss on sale of hotel properties, net (4,755) (16) (8,301) 28 Noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures 8 137 181 131 Adjustments related to consolidated joint venture (1) (47) (44) (139) (131) Adjustments related to unconsolidated joint venture (2) 227 236 685 709 FFO 54,689 55,104 170,315 185,126 Transaction costs 209 2 299 26 Pre-opening costs (3) 888 327 1,088 1,188 Loss on extinguishment of indebtedness, net 129 129 169 Amortization of share-based compensation 4,550 6,247 16,260 18,028 Non-cash interest expense related to discontinued interest rate hedges 386 482 1,287 1,446 Other expenses (4) 304 930 2,256 1,026 Adjusted FFO 61,155 63,092 191,634 207,009

 (2) Includes our ownership interest in the depreciation and amortization expense of the unconsolidated joint venture. 
 (3) Represents expenses related to the brand conversions of certain hotel properties prior to opening. 
 (4) Represents expenses and income outside of the normal course of operations. 
 
 EBITDA and EBITDA re 
 
 EBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) income tax expense; and (3) depreciation and amortization expense. We consider EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of our operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense) from our operating results. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and disposals. 
 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 In addition to EBITDA, we present EBITDA re in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, which defines EBITDA re as net income or loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA re provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs. 
 
 We also present Adjusted EBITDA, which includes additional adjustments for items such as transaction costs, pre-opening costs, gains or losses on extinguishment of indebtedness, amortization of share-based compensation, derivative gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income reclassified to earnings, and certain other income or expenses that we consider outside the normal course of operations. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income, EBITDA, and EBITDA re , is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance. 
 
 The following table is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to EBITDA, EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 20,643 16,343 62,680 68,577 Depreciation and amortization 44,892 44,727 134,045 134,648 Interest expense, net of interest income 24,357 19,531 69,959 59,529 Income tax expense 379 332 1,081 1,028 Adjustments related to unconsolidated joint venture (1) 331 344 998 1,034 EBITDA 90,602 81,277 268,763 264,816 (Gain) loss on sale of hotel properties, net (4,755) (16) (8,301) 28 EBITDA re

 (2) Represents expenses related to the brand conversions of certain hotel properties prior to opening. 
 (3) Represents expenses and income outside of the normal course of operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of the funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotel properties, including: 
 
 funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring hotel properties; 
 
 redevelopments, conversions, renovations and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotel properties; 
 
 recurring maintenance and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our hotel properties in accordance with brand standards; 
 
 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness; 
 
 distributions on common and preferred shares; 
 
 share repurchases under our share repurchase programs; and

 corporate and other general and administrative expenses. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 424.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reserves as compared to 555.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Cash flows from Operating Activities 
 
 The net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled 214.4 million and 226.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our cash flows provided by operating activities generally consist of the net cash generated by our hotel operations, the cash paid for corporate expenses and other working capital changes. Refer to the "Results of Operations" section for further discussion of our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Cash flows from Investing Activities 
 
 The net cash flow used in investing activities totaled 246.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 122.8 million acquisition of a fee simple interest in our Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill hotel property, a 35.9 million acquisition of a hotel property, and 107.0 million in capital improvements and additions to our hotel properties and other assets. The net cash flow used in investing activities was partially offset by 19.5 million in proceeds from the sales of two hotel properties. 
 
 The net cash flow used in investing activities totaled 102.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to capital improvements and additions to our hotel properties. 
 
 Cash flows from Financing Activities 
 
 The net cash flow used in financing activities totaled 99.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The sources of cash included 500.0 million in borrowings on a Term Loan and 200.0 million in borrowings on our Revolver. The uses of cash included 400.0 million in repayment of a term loan, 200.0 million in repayment of a maturing mortgage loan, 100.0 million in repayment of our Revolver, 19.0 million paid to repurchase common shares under our share repurchase programs, 65.8 million in distributions to shareholders and unitholders, 9.0 million paid to repurchase common shares to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements, and 5.3 million in deferred financing cost payments. 
 
 The net cash flow used in financing activities totaled 130.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to 66.8 million paid to repurchase common shares under our share repurchase programs, 52.6 million in distributions to shareholders and unitholders, 4.4 million paid to repurchase common shares to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements, and 7.8 million in deferred financing cost payments. 
 
 Capital Expenditures and Reserve Funds 
 
 We maintain each of our hotel properties in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, franchise agreements and management agreements. The cost of routine improvements and alterations are paid out of FF E reserves, which are funded by a portion of each hotel property s gross revenues. Routine capital expenditures may be administered by the property management companies. However, we have approval rights over the capital expenditures as part of the annual budget process for each of our hotel properties. 
 
 From time to time, certain of our hotel properties may undergo renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the hotels, such as guestrooms, public space, meeting space, and/or restaurants, in order to better compete with other hotels and alternative lodging options in our markets. In addition, upon acquisition of a hotel property we often are required to complete a property improvement plan in order to bring the hotel up to the respective franchisor s standards. If permitted by the terms of the management agreement, funding for a renovation will first come from the FF E reserves. To the extent that the FF E reserves are not available or sufficient to cover the cost of the renovation, we will fund all or the remaining portion of the renovation with cash and cash equivalents on hand, our Revolver and/or other sources of available liquidity. 
 
 With respect to some of our hotels that are operated under franchise agreements with major national hotel brands and for some of our hotels subject to first mortgage liens, we are obligated to maintain FF E reserve accounts for future capital expenditures at these hotels. The amount funded into each of these reserve accounts is generally determined pursuant to the 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 management agreements, franchise agreements and/or mortgage loan documents for each of the respective hotels, and typically ranges between 3.0 and 5.0 of the respective hotel s total gross revenue. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 39.0 million was held in FF E reserve accounts for future capital expenditures. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market risk includes the risks that arise from changes in interest rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.2 billion of total variable rate debt outstanding (or 54.1 of total indebtedness) with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.12 per annum. After taking into consideration the effect of interest rate swaps, 74.0 of our total indebtedness was fixed or effectively fixed. As of September 30, 2024, if market interest rates on our variable rate debt not subject to interest rate swaps were to increase by 1.00 , or 100 basis points, interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 5.8 million annually, taking into account our existing contractual hedging arrangements. 
 
 Our interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable. We have entered into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate our interest rate risk or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 
 The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2024, the following table presents the principal repayments and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates (in thousands): 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt (1)(2) 500,000 525,000 1,025,000 Weighted-average interest rate 3.75 4.05 3.90 Variable rate debt (1) 181,000 425,000 600,000 1,206,000 Weighted-average interest rate (3) 5.02 5.15 5.12 5.12 Total 181,000 925,000 600,000 525,000 2,231,000 
 
 (1) Excludes 7.0 million, 0.2 million and 6.6 million of net deferred financing costs on the Term Loans, mortgage loans and Senior Notes, respectively. 
 (2) Excludes 1.6 million related to a fair value adjustment on debt. 
 (3) The weighted-average interest rate gives effect to interest rate swaps, as applicable. 
 
 Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods, prevailing interest rates and our hedging strategies at that time. 
 
 Changes in market interest rates on our fixed rate debt impact the fair value of our debt, but such changes have no impact on our consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was 974.8 million, which was based on having the same debt service requirements that could have been borrowed at the date presented, at prevailing current market interest rates. If interest rates were to rise by 1.00 , or 100 basis points, and our fixed rate debt balance remained constant, we expect the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately 29.7 million. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive s separation from service, (i) the Executive is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A and using the identification methodology selected by the Company from time to time), and (ii) the Company makes a good faith determination that an amount payable on account of such separation from service to the Executive constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) the payment of which is required to be delayed pursuant to the six (6) month delay rule set forth in Section 409A in order to avoid taxes or penalties under Section 409A (the Delay Period ), then the Company will not pay such amount on the otherwise scheduled payment date but will instead pay it in a lump sum on the first business day after such six (6) month period (or upon the Executive s death, if earlier), together with interest for the period of delay, compounded annually, equal to the prime rate (as published in the Wall Street Journal) in effect as of the dates the payments should otherwise have been provided. To the extent that any benefits to be provided during the Delay Period are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A provided on account of a separation from service, and such benefits are not otherwise exempt from Section 409A, the Executive shall pay the cost of such benefit during the Delay Period, and the Company shall reimburse the Executive, to the extent that such costs would otherwise have been paid by the Company or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have been provided by the Company at no cost to the Executive, the Company s share of the cost of such benefits upon expiration of the Delay Period, and any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the procedures specified herein. 
 
 (c) (i) Any amount that the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed under this Agreement will be reimbursed to the Executive as promptly as practical and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the expenses are incurred, (ii) any right to reimbursement or in kind benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (iii) the amount of the expenses eligible for reimbursement during any taxable year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year. 
 (d) Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., payment shall be made within thirty (30) 
 14 

days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. 
 
 12. Parachute Payment Limitations 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of any other agreement, contract, or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by the Executive and the Company or its affiliates, except an agreement, contract, or understanding hereafter entered into that expressly modifies or excludes application of this Section 12 (the Other Agreements ), and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan or other arrangement heretofore or hereafter adopted by the Company or any of its affiliates for the direct or indirect compensation of the Executive (including groups or classes of participants or beneficiaries of which the Executive is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the Executive (a Benefit Arrangement ), if the Executive is a disqualified individual, as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code, any right to receive any payment or other benefit under this Agreement shall not become exercisable or vested (i) to the extent that such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit, taking into account all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the Executive under the Agreement, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements, would cause any payment or benefit to the Executive under this Agreement to be considered a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code as then in effect (a Parachute Payment and (ii) if, as a result of receiving a Parachute Payment, the aggregate after-tax amounts received by the Executive from the Company or any of its affiliates under this Agreement, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements would be less than the maximum after-tax amount that could be received by the Executive without causing any such payment or benefit to be considered a Parachute Payment. In the event that the receipt of any such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit under this Agreement, in conjunction with all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the Executive under the Agreement, any Other Agreement or any Benefit Arrangement would cause the Executive to be considered to have received a Parachute Payment under this Agreement that would have the effect of decreasing the after-tax amount received by the Executive as described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, then the Executive shall have the right, in the Executive s sole discretion, to designate those rights, payments, or benefits under this Agreement, any Other Agreements, and any Benefit Arrangements that should be reduced or eliminated so as to avoid having the payment or benefit to the Executive under this Agreement be deemed to be a Parachute Payment provided, however, that, to the extent any payment or benefit constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A, in order to comply with Section 409A, the reduction or elimination will be performed in the following order (A) reduction of cash payments (B) reduction of COBRA benefits (C) cancellation of acceleration of vesting on any equity awards for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying equity and (D) cancellation of acceleration of vesting of equity awards not covered under (C) above provided, however that in the event that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be cancelled, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of such equity awards, that is, later granted equity awards shall be canceled before earlier granted equity awards. 
 15 

13. Clawback Policies 
 The Executive is subject to any recoupment or clawback policies that the Company may implement or maintain at any time regarding incentive-based compensation, which is granted or awarded to the Executive on or after the date of this Agreement. Such policies may include the right to recover incentive-based compensation (including stock options awarded as compensation) awarded or received during the three-year period preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under federal securities laws. The Executive agrees to amend any awards and agreements entered into on or after the date of this Agreement as the Company may request to reasonably implement such policies. 
 
 14. Miscellaneous
