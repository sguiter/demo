FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward-looking statements are all statements, other than statements of historical fact, that may be made by Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company") from time to time. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "expects", "intends", "may", "plans", "projects", "forecasts", "will", "would", "could", and similar expressions, or expressions of the negative of these terms. Forward-looking statements may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters, opportunities and risks (including potential risks associated with physical and transitional impacts of climate change and related voluntary and regulatory carbon requirements); exposure to and effects of hedging raw material and energy prices and foreign currencies exchange and interest rates; disruption or interruption of operations and of raw material or energy supply; operating risks related to the Company s information technology infrastructure, including potential service interruptions, data corruption and reputational damage as a result of cyber-based threats and attacks; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin and sales; pending, threatened and future legal proceedings; earnings, cash flow, dividends, stock repurchases and other financial results, events, decisions, and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses, and operating segments, as well as for the whole of Eastman; cash sources and requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans and activities; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated and other future restructuring, acquisition, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; the timing and costs of, benefits from the integration of, and expected business and financial performance of acquired businesses, as well as the subsequent impairment assessments of acquired long-lived assets; strategic, technology, and product innovation initiatives and development, production, commercialization and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business, and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and interest costs. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are based upon certain underlying assumptions as of the date such statements were made. Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and other analyses of current market conditions and trends, management expectations, plans, and strategies, economic conditions, and other factors. Forward-looking statements and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. The known material factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are identified and discussed under "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. Other factors, risks or uncertainties of which management is not aware, or presently deems immaterial, could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as may be required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or alter these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Company press releases, or pre-noticed public investor presentations) on related subjects.

 The Company works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working capital and cash flows. Under a supplier finance program, the Company's suppliers may voluntarily sell receivables due from Eastman to a participating financial institution. Eastman's responsibility is limited to making payments on the terms originally negotiated with suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. The range of payment terms Eastman negotiates with suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether a supplier participates in the program. No fees are paid by Eastman for the supplier finance platform or services fees. Eastman or the financial institution may terminate the program at any time with immediate effect upon 90 days' notice. Confirmed obligations in the supplier finance program of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included in "Payables and other current liabilities" on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

 million notional amount designated as an interest rate swap on the 3.80 notes due March 2025, resulting in an immaterial cash loss which is included as part of operating activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 Net investment hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investments in certain foreign operations. The net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying net investment hedges is reported as a component of the "Cumulative Translation Adjustment" ("CTA") within AOCI on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Cash flows from the CTA component are classified as operating activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recognized in CTA is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. In the event of a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment, cash flows from net investment hedges are classified as investing activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 For derivative cross-currency interest rate swap net investment hedges, gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in CTA within AOCI and recognized in earnings through the periodic swap interest accruals. The cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges are included as part of "Other long-term liabilities", "Other noncurrent assets", "Payables and other current liabilities", or "Other current assets" on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Cash flows from excluded components are classified as operating activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 Eastman enters into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps and designates these swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in a non-U.S. dollar functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. These contracts involve the exchange of fixed U.S. dollars with fixed foreign currency interest payments periodically over the life of the contracts and an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 All the Company's derivative assets and liabilities are currently classified as Level 2. Level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. These standard pricing models use inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. The fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party. In addition, on an ongoing basis, the Company compares a subset of its valuations against valuations received from counterparties to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. The Company had derivatives classified as Level 3 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the Company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance, and the Company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an ongoing basis. The Company did not recognize a credit loss during third quarter and first nine months 2024 or 2023. 
 
 All the Company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. In addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. The Company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements. 
 
 The Company has elected to present derivative contracts on a gross basis on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Losses in AOCI increased between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of a decrease in euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates.

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is based upon the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company"), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), and should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements, including related notes, and MD A contained in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and the unaudited consolidated financial statements, including related notes, included in Part I, Item 1, in this Quarterly Report. All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are diluted EPS unless otherwise noted.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures, and the accompanying reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, are presented below in this section and in "Overview", "Results of Operations", "Summary by Operating Segment", and "Liquidity and Other Financial Information - Cash Flows" in this MD A. 
 
 Management discloses non-GAAP financial measures, and the related reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess the Company's and its operating segments' performances, make resource allocation decisions, and evaluate organizational and individual performances in determining certain performance-based compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have definitions under GAAP, and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any non-GAAP financial measure, but to consider such measures alongside the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 
 Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-Core Items and any Unusual or Non-Recurring Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Earnings 
 
 In addition to evaluating Eastman's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows as reported in accordance with GAAP, management evaluates Company and operating segment performance, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions, excluding the effect of transactions, costs, and losses or gains that do not directly result from Eastman's normal, or "core", business and operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. 
 
 Non-core transactions, costs, and losses or gains relate to, among other things, cost reductions, growth and profitability improvement initiatives, changes in businesses and assets, and other events outside of the Company's core business operations, and have included asset impairments, restructuring, and other charges and gains, costs of and related to acquisitions, gains and losses from and costs related to dispositions, closures, or shutdowns of businesses or assets, financing transaction costs, environmental and other costs related to previously divested businesses or non-operational sites and product lines, and mark-to-market losses or gains for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
 
 In first nine months 2023, the Company recognized unusual insurance proceeds, net of costs from the previously reported January 31, 2022 operational incident at its Kingsport site as a result of a steam line failure (the "steam line incident"). Management considered the steam line incident unusual because of the Company's operational and safety history and the magnitude of the unplanned disruption. 
 
 Because non-core, unusual, or non-recurring transactions, costs, and losses or gains may materially affect the Company's, or any particular operating segment's, financial condition or results in a specific period in which they are recognized, management believes it is appropriate to evaluate the financial measures prepared and calculated in accordance with both GAAP and the related non-GAAP financial measures excluding the effect on the Company's results of these non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. In addition to using such measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management evaluates such non-GAAP measures, and believes that investors may also evaluate such measures, because such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's, and its segments', operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and, as a result, provide a better indication of expected future trends.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Adjusted Tax Rate and Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 In interim periods, Eastman discloses non-GAAP earnings with an adjusted effective tax rate and a resulting adjusted provision for income taxes using the Company's forecasted tax rate for the full year as of the end of the interim period. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes are equal to the Company's projected full year effective tax rate and provision for income taxes on earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items for completed periods. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes may fluctuate during the year for changes in events and circumstances that change the Company's forecasted annual effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Management discloses this adjusted effective tax rate, and the related reconciliation to the GAAP effective tax rate, to provide investors more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's operational performance on a period-over-period interim basis and on the same basis as management evaluates quarterly financial results to provide a better indication of expected full year results. 
 
 Non-GAAP Debt Measure 
 
 Eastman from time to time evaluates and discloses to investors and securities and credit analysts the non-GAAP debt measure "net debt", which management defines as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities and credit analysts to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating the Company's overall financial position, liquidity, and leverage and because management believes investors, securities analysts, credit analysts and rating agencies, and lenders often use a similar measure to assess and compare companies' relative financial position and liquidity. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures in this Quarterly Report 
 
 The following non-core items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Quarterly Report: 
 Asset impairments, restructuring, and other charges, net; 
 Cost of sales impact from restructuring activities; and 
 Environmental and other costs from previously divested or non-operational sites and product lines. 
 
 The following unusual items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Quarterly Report: 
 Steam line incident costs (insurance proceeds), net. 
 
 As described above, the alternative non-GAAP measure of debt, "net debt", is also presented in this Quarterly Report.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This MD A includes an analysis of the effect of the foregoing on the following GAAP financial measures: 
 
 Gross profit; 
 Other (income) charges, net; 
 Earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"); 
 Provision for income taxes; 
 Net earnings attributable to Eastman; 
 Diluted EPS; and 
 Total borrowings. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Advanced Materials ("AM"), Additives Functional Products ("AFP"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. Eastman uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development capabilities, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company's world class technology platforms form the foundation of sustainable growth by differentiated products through significant scale advantages in research and development ("R D") and advantaged global market access. Molecular recycling technologies continue to be an area of investment focus for the Company and extends the level of differentiation afforded by our world class technology platforms. Differentiated application development converts market complexity into opportunities for growth and accelerates innovation by enabling a deeper understanding of the value of Eastman's products and how they perform within customers' and end-user products. Key areas of application development include thermoplastic conversion, functional films, coatings formulations, textiles and nonwovens, and personal and home care formulations. The Company engages the market by working directly with customers and downstream users, targeting attractive niche markets, and leveraging disruptive macro trends. Management believes that these elements of the Company's innovation-driven growth model, combined with disciplined portfolio management and balanced capital deployment, will result in consistent, sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow from operations. 
 
 Sales, EBIT, and EBIT excluding non-core and unusual items were as follows: 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales 2,464 2,267 7,137 7,003 Earnings before interest and taxes 329 256 929 825 Earnings before interest and taxes excluding non-core and unusual items 366 256 993 875 
 
 Sales revenue increased in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 primarily due to higher sales volume. Sales revenue increased in first nine months 2024 compared to first nine months 2023 primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by lower selling prices. Higher sales volume was primarily attributed to the end of customer inventory destocking across most end-markets. Lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material and energy prices and lower distribution prices. 
 
 EBIT excluding non-core and unusual items increased in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 primarily due to higher sales volume, higher selling prices, and lower raw material and energy costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher SG A expenses. EBIT excluding non-core and unusual items increased in first nine months 2024 compared to first nine months 2023 primarily due to higher sales volume and lower raw material and energy costs, net of lower selling prices. These impacts were partially offset by higher SG A expenses. 
 
 Further discussion of sales revenue and EBIT changes is presented in "Results of Operations" and "Summary by Operating Segment" in this MD A.

SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT 
 
 Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Advanced Materials ("AM"), Additives Functional Products ("AFP"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. For additional financial and product information for each operating segment, see Part I, Item 1, "Business - Business Segments" and Part II, Item 8, Note 20, "Segment and Regional Sales Information", in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

 Sales revenue increased in third quarter and first nine months 2024 compared to third quarter and first nine months 2023 primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by lower selling prices. Higher sales volume was primarily attributed to the end of customer inventory destocking in consumer durables, and product growth of premium interlayers products. 
 
 EBIT in third quarter 2024 and first nine months 2024 includes asset impairments, restructuring, and other charges, net, and inventory adjustments, related to the planned closure of a solvent-based resins production line. For more information regarding asset impairments, restructuring, and other charges see Note 12, "Asset Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Charges, Net" , to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 EBIT excluding non-core items increased third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 primarily due to 37 million higher sales volume and improved asset utilization, net of higher manufacturing costs associated with Kingsport methanolysis. These impacts were partially offset by 4 million higher SG A expenses. 
 
 EBIT excluding non-core items increased in first nine months 2024 compared to first nine months 2023 primarily due to 88 million higher sales volume. This impact was partially offset by a 10 million unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Sales revenue increased in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices. Sales revenue in first nine months 2024 was relatively unchanged compared to first nine months 2023 due to higher sales volume being offset by lower selling prices. Higher sales volume was primarily attributed to the end of customer inventory destocking and improved market conditions in 2024. Fluctuations in selling prices were driven by changes in raw material and energy prices. 
 
 EBIT increased in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 primarily due to 28 million higher selling prices, net of higher raw material and energy costs and 10 million lower manufacturing costs, including higher capacity utilization, partially offset by 5 million higher SG A expenses. 
 
 EBIT decreased in first nine months 2024 compared to first nine months 2023 due to 33 million lower selling prices, net of lower raw material and energy costs. These impacts were partially offset by 28 million lower manufacturing costs, including higher capacity utilization.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

LIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet known short and long-term cash requirements. However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. Management believes maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategy and financial flexibility. 
 First Nine Months (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities 747 922 Investing activities (402) (680) Financing activities (273) (295) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2 (1) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 74 (54) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 548 493 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 622 439 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities decreased 175 million in first nine months 2024 compared to first nine months 2023 primarily due to higher working capital. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased 278 million in first nine months 2024 compared to first nine months 2023 primarily due to lower capital expenditures primarily for the AM segment methanolysis plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling manufacturing facilities. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased 22 million in first nine months 2024 compared to first nine months 2023, primarily due to higher net borrowings partially offset by higher treasury stock purchases. For additional information, see "Liquidity and Other Financial Information - Debt and Other Commitments" in this MD A. 
 
 Working Capital Management and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Eastman applies a proactive and disciplined approach to working capital management to optimize cash flow and to enable a full range of capital allocation options in support of the Company's strategy. Eastman expects to continue utilizing the programs described below to support operating cash flow consistent with past practices. 
 
 The Company has off balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs under which entire invoices may be sold to third-party financial institutions. The vast majority of these programs are without recourse. Available capacity under these programs, which the Company uses as a routine source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. The total amounts sold in third quarter 2024 and 2023 were 703 million and 692 million, respectively, and 2.0 billion and 2.1 billion in first nine months 2024 and 2023, respectively. Based on the original terms of receivables sold for certain programs and actual outstanding balance of receivables under servicing agreements, the Company estimates that 412 million and 397 million of these receivables would have been outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, had they not been sold under these factoring programs. 
 
 The Company works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working capital and cash flows. Under a supplier finance program, the Company's suppliers may voluntarily sell receivables due from Eastman to a participating financial institution. The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the program require payment in full on the invoice due date. For additional information, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Debt and Other Commitments 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company's borrowings totaled 5.1 billion with various maturities. The Company expects to use a combination of available cash and debt proceeds to repay the 450 million principal of 3.80 notes due March 2025. 
 
 In third quarter 2024, the Company issued 500 million aggregate principal amount 5.0 notes due August 2029 in a registered public offering (the "2029 Notes"). Proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Notes, net of original issue discounts and issuance costs, were 495 million. The Company also redeemed 250 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.80 notes due March 2025 (the "2025 Notes") during third quarter 2024. Redemption of the 2025 Notes resulted in immaterial gain on extinguishment of debt. 
 
 In second quarter 2024, the Company repaid the 43 million 7.625 debentures due June 2024 using available cash and debt proceeds. There were no debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of this debt. 
 
 In first quarter 2024, the Company repaid the 198 million 7.25 debentures due January 2024 using available cash. There were no extinguishment costs associated with the repayment. In first quarter 2024, the Company also issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625 notes due February 2034 in a registered public offering (the "2034 Notes"). Proceeds from the sale of the 2034 Notes, net of original issue discounts and issuance costs, were 742 million. 
 
 See Note 4, "Borrowings", to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 
 In first quarter 2024, purchase obligations in the 2029 and beyond period decreased by approximately 1.5 billion as a result of exiting an agreement with a supplier after contract negotiations. Eastman had remaining debt and other commitments at September 30, 2024 totaling approximately 10.7 billion over a period of approximately 30 years. 
 
 Other than the item discussed above, there have been no material changes to the Company's commitments from those disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Other Financial Information - Debt and Other Commitments" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 Credit Facility, Term Loans, and Commercial Paper Borrowings 
 
 The Company has access to a 1.50 billion revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility"). In February 2024, the Credit Facility was amended to extend the maturity to February 2029. All other material terms of the Credit Facility remain unchanged. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. The Credit Facility includes sustainability-linked pricing terms, provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes, and supports commercial paper borrowings. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and no commercial paper borrowings. 
 
 In third quarter 2024, the Company repaid 250 million of the 500 million five-year term loan (the "2027 Term Loan"). In first quarter 2024, the Company repaid the 300 million two-year term loan (the "2024 Term Loan"). There were no extinguishment costs associated with the repayments of either loan. The outstanding balance on the 2027 Term Loan was 249 million at September 30, 2024 and 499 million at December 31, 2023, with variable interest rates of 6.07 and 6.58 , respectively. The 2027 Term Loan is subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. 
 
 The Credit Facility and the 2027 Term Loan contain customary covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, that determine the events of default, amounts available, and terms of borrowings. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The total amount of available borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024.

 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditures were 420 million and 649 million in first nine months 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in first nine months 2024 were primarily for the AM segment methanolysis plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling manufacturing facilities, other targeted growth initiatives, and site modernization projects. The Company expects that 2024 capital expenditures will be approximately 625 million. 
 
 Stock Repurchases 
 
 In December 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2.5 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (the "2021 authorization"). During third quarter and first nine months 2024, the Company repurchased 1,018,269 and 2,018,274 shares of common stock, respectively, for 100 million and 200 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 10,629,023 shares have been repurchased under the 2021 authorization for 985 million. Both dividends and share repurchases are key strategies employed by the Company to return value to its stockholders. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, fair value of disposal groups, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Eastman evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the critical accounting estimates described in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
 For information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Eastman has exposure to various market risks principally due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the pricing of various commodities, and interest rates. In an effort to manage these risks, the Company employs various strategies, including pricing, inventory management, and hedging. The Company enters into derivative contracts which are governed by policies, procedures, and internal processes set forth by its Board of Directors. 
 
 The Company determines its exposures to market risk by utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates. For more information regarding exposures, refer to Part II, Item 7A of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 At September 30, 2024, a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have had a 228 million impact on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the designation of the euro-denominated borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedges of the net investments, foreign currency translation gains and losses on the borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of the "Change in cumulative translation adjustment" within "Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Therefore, a foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings or the foreign currency change in the designated cross-currency interest rate swaps. 
 
 Other than the foreign currency risk discussed above, there have been no material changes to the Company's market risks from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Eastman maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 General 
 
 From time to time, Eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Consistent with the requirements of Regulation S-K, Item 103, the Company's threshold for disclosing any environmental legal proceeding involving a governmental authority is potential monetary sanctions that management believes will meet or exceed 1 million. 
 
 Solutia Legacy Torts Claims Litigation 
 
 Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement effective February 28, 2008 between Solutia, Inc. ("Solutia") and Monsanto Company ("Monsanto") in connection with Solutia's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings (the "Monsanto Settlement Agreement"), Monsanto is responsible for the defense and indemnification of Solutia against any Legacy Tort Claims (as defined in the Monsanto Settlement Agreement) and Solutia has agreed to retain responsibility for certain tort claims, if any, that may arise from Solutia's conduct after its spinoff from Pharmacia Corporation (f/k/a Monsanto), which occurred on September 1, 1997. Solutia, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastman upon Eastman's acquisition of Solutia in July 2012, has been named as a defendant in several such proceedings, and has submitted the matters to Monsanto, which was acquired by Bayer AG in June 2018, as Legacy Tort Claims. To the extent these matters are not within the meaning of Legacy Tort Claims, Solutia could potentially be liable thereunder. In connection with the completion of its acquisition of Solutia, Eastman guaranteed the obligations of Solutia and Eastman was added as an indemnified party under the Monsanto Settlement Agreement. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

As of September 30, 2024, a total of 10,629,023 shares have been repurchased under the 2021 authorization for 985 million.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 (c) Director and Officer Trading Arrangements 
 
 A portion of our directors and officers compensation is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, they may engage in open-market transactions involving Company securities for diversification or other personal reasons. All such transactions in Company securities by directors and officers must comply with the Company s Insider Trading Policy, which requires that transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in the Company s securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information. The Company s Insider Trading Policy permits our directors and executive officers to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1. 
 
 The following table describes the contracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of securities adopted by our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). No other Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements" (as defined by Regulation S-K Item 408(c)) were entered into or terminated by our directors or officers during such period.
