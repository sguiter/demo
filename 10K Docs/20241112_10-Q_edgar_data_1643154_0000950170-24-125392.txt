Any statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as believe, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan and would. For example, statements concerning financial condition, possible or assumed future results of operations, growth opportunities, industry ranking, plans and objectives of management, markets for our common shares and future management and organizational structure are all forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
 Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed throughout our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates described in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K as may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we referenced herein and have filed as exhibits to the reports we file with the SEC, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. You should assume that the information appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is accurate as of the date hereof. Because the risk factors in our SEC reports could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and particularly our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.

The Company's effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to its reserve for uncertain tax positions based on the legal interpretations of IRC Section 280E, and accumulated penalties and interest on outstanding tax obligations . The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only when it is more likely than not of being sustainable. The taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. It is reasonable that the existing liabilities for the unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease over the next 12 months as a result of assessments, examinations and statute expirations; however, the ultimate timing of the resolution of these items is highly uncertain. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has million of reserves for unrecognized tax positions included as part of long-term liabilities, that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The reserves were established primarily due to the legal interpretations that challenge the Company's tax liability under IRC Section 280E. The Company has applied the legal interpretation of IRC Section 280E to certain amended returns filed during this fiscal year for the tax years ending December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, as well as to future tax filings. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service filed Notices of Federal Tax Liens against certain subsidiaries of the Company in the aggregate amount of approximately million and million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The Company is actively working to resolve these matters with the Internal Revenue Service.

Specifically, the order denied the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue; however, the court granted the Company s motion to dismiss the Roberts Plaintiffs claims for specific performance, conversion and civil theft without prejudice. With respect to the claim for conversion and civil theft, the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County provided the Roberts Plaintiffs with leave to amend their respective complaints.

On March 28, 2022, the court consolidated the action filed against Randy Maslow with the Roberts Plaintiffs action for discovery and trial purposes. As a result, the court vacated the matter s initial trial date of May 9, 2022 and the case has not been reset for trial yet.

On April 19, 2024, the Roberts Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Speedy Trial due to the ages and health of the Roberts Plaintiffs. On May 14, 2024, the court initially issued a scheduling order that, among other things, set this matter for a jury trial to occur sometime between October 21, 2024 and December 27, 2024; however, due to competing schedules of the parties, the court elected to specially set the trial. On October 15, 2024, the court issued an order specially setting the trial to begin on January 14, 2025.

Specifically, CGX is seeking: (i) an order finding the Defendants in breach of the Option Agreements and directing specific performance by the Defendants of their obligations under the Option Agreements to complete the sale and transfer of LMS to CGX; (ii) an order either tolling or extending the closing date under the Option Agreements; (ii) an order requiring Huber to restore LMS bank account of all sums withdrawn for the payment of contracts entered into in breach of the Option Agreements; and (iii) an order prohibiting Huber from withdrawing any further funds from LMS bank account. On June 8, 2022, the Defendants filed an Answering Statement, denying the allegations raised by CGX and sent a notice to CGX, purporting to terminate the Option Agreements. In addition, on June 8, 2022, LMS filed a demand for arbitration (the S8 Arbitration with the AAA against S8 Management, LLC S8 ), alleging that S8 breached the Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement (the MSA entered into between LMS and S8 on March 12, 2018. On June 24, 2022, the Defendants filed a Motion to Consolidate the CGX Arbitration and S8 Arbitration. On July 5, 2022, CGX filed an opposition to the Defendants Motion to Consolidate and a cross-Motion to Stay the S8 Arbitration to allow the CGX Arbitration to proceed first. On July 26, 2022, the parties attended a preliminary conference with the arbitrator, at which conference the arbitrator preliminarily granted the Defendants Motion to Consolidate and denied CGX s cross-Motion to Stay the S8 Arbitration. On October 7, 2022, CGX filed a dispositive motion for specific performance of Defendants obligations to complete the sale of LMS to CGX (claims (i) and (ii), above), which Defendants opposed. On October 31, 2022, the arbitrator granted CGX s dispositive motion and ordered Defendants to complete the sale of LMS to CGX. The remaining claims asserted in the CGX Arbitration (claims (iii) and (iv), above) and the S8 Arbitration remain pending. On November 30, 2022, Defendants filed a Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. CGX s filed its response on January 30, 2023, and subsequently the Defendants filed a Request for Hearing on February 3, 2023. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County had a hearing on the Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award on February 21, 2024, and on March 4, 2024, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County denied Defendants' Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. On April 8, 2024, the Defendants submitted the required ownership transfer paperwork to the Maryland Cannabis Administration (the "MCA") to request approval of the transfer of ownership of LMS to CGX following the denial of the Defendants' Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. Also on April 8, 2024, the Defendants requested that the MCA either deny the ownership transfer of LMS to CGX, or delay their consideration of the request until the S8 Arbitration is complete. On April 22, 2024, the MCA notified the parties that it will wait to consider the request to transfer ownership of LMS to CGX until the S8 Arbitration is complete. Beginning on July 15, 2024, the parties attended a hearing regarding claims (iii) and (iv) in the CGX Arbitration and the claims in the S8 Arbitration. The parties filed post-hearing briefs on August 27, 2024 and oral argument regarding the post-hearing briefs was held on September 16, 2024. On September 24, 2024, the arbitrator issued his final award, in which he denied the claims of all parties in the CGX Arbitration and S8 Arbitration. Now that the CGX Arbitration and S8 Arbitration are complete, CGX continues to pursue regulatory approval of the transfer of ownership of LMS to CGX from the MCA. On June 20, 2023, LMS filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against the Company and three wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the "iAnthus Defendants"), alleging conversion, RICO violations and unjust enrichment and seeking damages in excess of million, plus treble damages (the "Federal Complaint"). The allegations in the Federal Complaint appear substantially similar to, and appear to arise from substantially the same operative facts as, those alleged by LMS in the CGX Arbitration, the S8 Arbitration, and in support of the Defendants' Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. The iAnthus Defendants deny LMS s allegations alleging unlawful conduct. The iAnthus Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss (Or Stay the Proceedings) the Federal Complaint on September 11, 2023. On March 12, 2024, the court granted the iAnthus Defendants' motion and administratively stayed the Federal Complaint pending the outcome of the CGX Arbitration and the S8 Arbitration . On November 1, 2024, LMS filed a voluntary notice of dismissal, dismissing the Federal Complaint. On November 4, 2024, the court ordered that LMS s notice of dismissal be adopted and further ordered that the Federal Complaint be dismissed.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise note. 
 Overview 
 We are a vertically-integrated, multi-state owner and operator of licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities in the United States. Although, we are committed to creating a national retail brand and portfolio of branded cannabis products recognized in the United States, cannabis currently remains illegal under U.S. federal law. 
 Through our subsidiaries, we currently own and/or operate 40 dispensaries and eight cultivation and/or processing facilities in six U.S. states. Pursuant to our existing licenses, interests and contractual arrangements, and subject to regulatory approval, we have the capacity to own and/or operate up to an additional five dispensary licenses and/or dispensary facilities in two states, plus an uncapped number of dispensary licenses in Florida, and up to 18 cultivation, manufacturing and/or processing facilities, and we have the right to manufacture and distribute cannabis products in seven U.S. states, all subject to the necessary regulatory approvals. 
 Our multi-state operations encompass the full spectrum of medical and adult-use cannabis enterprises, including cultivation, processing, product development, wholesale-distribution and retail. Cannabis products offered by us include flower and trim, products containing cannabis flower and trim (such as packaged flower and pre-rolls), cannabis infused products (such as topical creams and edibles) and products containing cannabis extracts (such as vape cartridges, concentrates, live resins, wax products, oils and tinctures). Under U.S. federal law, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. Other than Epidiolex (cannabidiol), a cannabis-derived product, and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products (Marinol (dronabinol), Syndros (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone), to our knowledge, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved a marketing application for cannabis for the treatment of any disease or condition and has not approved any cannabis or cannabis-derived products. 
 Financial Restructuring 
 The significant disruption of global financial markets, and specifically, the decline in the overall public equity cannabis markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our ability to secure additional capital, which caused liquidity constraints. In early 2020, due to the liquidity constraints, we attempted to negotiate temporary relief of our interest obligations with the lenders (the Secured Lenders of our 13.0 senior secured debentures (the Secured Notes issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary, iAnthus Capital Management, LLC ICM ). However, we were unable to reach an agreement and did not make interest payments when due and payable to the Secured Lenders or payments that were due to the holders (the Unsecured Lenders and together with the Secured Lenders, the Lenders of our 8.0 convertible unsecured debentures (the Unsecured Debentures ). As a result, we defaulted on our obligations pursuant to the Secured Notes and Unsecured Debentures. 
 On July 10, 2020, we entered into a restructuring support agreement (as amended on June 15, 2021, the Restructuring Support Agreement with the Secured Lenders and certain of our Unsecured Lenders (the Consenting Unsecured Lenders to effectuate a recapitalization transaction (the Recapitalization Transaction which was consummated on June 24, 2022 (the "Closing Date"). 
 In connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, we issued an aggregate of 6,072,579,705 common shares to the Secured Lenders and the Unsecured Lenders. Specifically, we issued 3,036,289,852 common shares (the Secured Lender Shares ), or 48.625 of our outstanding common shares, to the Secured Lenders and 3,036,289,853 common shares (the Unsecured Lender Shares and together with Secured Lender Shares, the Shares ), or 48.625 of our outstanding common shares, to the Unsecured Lenders. As of the Closing Date, we had 6,244,297,897 common shares issued and outstanding. As of the Closing Date, the holders of our common shares collectively held 171,718,192 common shares, or 2.75 of our outstanding common shares.

As of the Closing Date, the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes (including the interim financing secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 14.7 million originally due on July 13, 2025) together with interest accrued and fees thereon were forgiven in part and exchanged for (A) the Secured Lender Shares, (B) the issuance of the 8.0 secured debentures (the "June Secured Debentures") to the lender parties (the "New Secured Lenders") in the aggregate principal amount of 99.7 million and (C) the issuance of the 8.0 unsecured debentures (the June Unsecured Debentures to the Secured Lenders in the aggregate principal amount of 5.0 million. Also, as of the Closing Date, the outstanding principal amount of the Unsecured Debentures together with interest accrued and fees thereon were forgiven in part and exchanged for (A) the Unsecured Lender Shares and (B) the June Unsecured Debentures in the aggregate principal amount of 15.0 million. Furthermore, all existing options and warrants to purchase our common shares, including certain debenture warrants and exchange warrants previously issued to the Secured Lenders, the warrants previously issued in connection with the Unsecured Debentures and all other Affected Equity (as defined in the amended and restated plan of arrangement (the "Plan of Arrangement"), were cancelled and extinguished for no consideration. 
 Registration Rights Agreement 
 In connection with the consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the RRA ), dated June 24, 2022, with ICM and certain holders of Registrable Securities (as defined in the RRA) (the Holders pursuant to which we shall, upon receipt of written notice (the Shelf Request from Holders of at least 15.0 of our outstanding common shares (the Substantial Holders ), prepare and file (i) with the applicable Canadian Securities Regulators (as defined in the RRA), a Shelf Prospectus (as defined in the RRA) to facilitate a secondary offering of all of the Registrable Securities or (ii) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), a registration statement on Form S-3 (the S-3 Registration Statement covering the resale of all Registrable Securities. In addition, pursuant to the RRA and subject to certain exceptions, the Substantial Holders may request (the Demand Registration Request that we file a Prospectus (as defined in the RRA) (other than a Shelf Prospectus) or a registration statement on any form that we are then eligible to use (the Registration Statement to facilitate a Distribution (as defined in the RRA) in Canada or the United States of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities (the Demand Registration held by the Holders requesting the Demand Registration. Moreover, pursuant to the RRA and subject to certain exceptions, if, at any time, we propose to make a Distribution for our own account, we shall notify the Holders of such Distribution (the Piggyback Registration and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to include in the Piggyback Registration such Registrable Securities requested by the Holders be included in such Piggyback Registration. 
 Investor Rights Agreement 
 Furthermore, in connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, we entered into an Investor Rights Agreement IRA ), dated June 24, 2022, with ICH, ICM and certain investors (the Investors ). Pursuant to the IRA, among other things, the Investors are entitled to designate nominees for election or appointment to our Board as follows: 
 one investor (the First Investor shall be entitled to designate director nominees as follows:

iii. For so long as the First Investor s Debt Exchange Common Share Percentage is less than 15.0 but is at least 5.0 , the First Investor shall be entitled to designate up to one individual as a director nominee. 

a second Investor (the Second Investor shall be entitled to designate up to one individual as a director nominee for so long as such Investor s Debt Exchange Common Share Percentage is at least 5.0 .

Pursuant to the IRA, the Secured Lenders appointed Scott Cohen, Michelle Mathews-Spradlin and Kenneth Gilbert to serve on our Board. Mr. Cohen and Ms. Mathews-Spradlin s appointments were effective as of the Closing Date and Mr. Gilbert s appointment was effective as of August 11, 2022. The Consenting Unsecured Lenders initially appointed Zachary Arrick, Alexander Shoghi and Marco D Attanasio to serve on our Board effective as of the Closing Date. On September 15, 2022, Mr. D Attanasio resigned as a member of our Board and audit committee. On February 21, 2023, Mr. Arrick resigned as a member of our Board, compensation, nominating and corporate governance committees. On April 20, 2023, John Paterson was appointed to our Board. Mr. Paterson was nominated as a replacement director for Mr. D'Attanasio by the Investor that initially nominated Mr. D'Attanasio. On March 9, 2024, Mr. Paterson resigned as a member of our Board, audit committee and nominating and corporate governance committee. As of the date hereof, the Consenting Unsecured Lenders have not filled the vacancies on our Board created by Mr. Arrick s or Mr. Paterson's resignations. The directors appointed by the Secured Lenders and Consenting Unsecured Lenders will serve as our directors until our next annual general meeting of shareholders or until their successors are duly elected or appointed. 
 Pursuant to the IRA, we are required to hire a chief executive officer (and any successor thereto) who has been unanimously approved by the Investors. Upon the chief executive officer taking office (other than an interim chief executive officer), we are obligated to arrange for the chief executive officer to be appointed to our Board. Accordingly, we appointed Richard Proud as a member of our Board upon his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, which had been unanimously approved by the Investors. 
 Dispositions 
 Certain Massachusetts Assets 
 On February 9, 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Mayflower Medicinals, Inc. ("Mayflower"), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "MA Purchase Agreement") with an unaffiliated third-party buyer (the "MA Buyer"), pursuant to which, Mayflower agreed to sell certain of its assets associated with its Holliston, Massachusetts cultivation and product manufacturing facility (the "Purchased Assets") for 3.0 million (the "Purchase Price"). The transaction closed on September 27, 2024 (the "MA Closing Date"). On the MA Closing Date, 0.5 million was paid in cash (the "Cash Closing Payment"), while the remaining 2.5 million of the Purchase Price will be paid in installments pursuant to two promissory notes as follows: 0.5 million to be paid in equal monthly installments over eight months with interest accruing at 7 per annum, and 2 million to be paid in equal monthly installments over 36 months with interest accruing at 7 per annum. As security for payments under the notes, Mayflower executed a security agreement, granting it a first priority lien on the purchased assets. The proceeds from the Cash Closing Payment were used to satisfy certain federal tax obligations. We recognized a gain of 2.2 million, which was the difference between the aggregate fair value of the consideration and the carrying value of the net assets disposed as of the MA Closing Date, which is presented in "recoveries, write-downs and other charges, net" on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Nevada Assets 
 On February 23, 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary, GreenMart of Nevada NLV, LLC ("GMNV") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "NV Purchase Agreement") with an unaffiliated third-party buyer (the "NV Buyer"), pursuant to which, GMNV agreed to sell substantially all of the assets of GMNV to the NV Buyer. GMNV currently operates a co-located medical and adult-use cultivation and production facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada and an adult-use dispensary in Las Vegas, Nevada and holds two conditional adult-use dispensary licenses to be located in Henderson and Reno, Nevada (the "Business"). The aggregate proceeds to be received from the sale are 6.5 million. The closing of the NV Purchase Agreement is subject to, among other customary conditions, receipt of approval of the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (the "NV CCB"), which remains open. On February 23, 2024, GMNV also entered into a Management Agreement (the "NV Management Agreement"), pursuant to which, the NV Buyer's affiliated entity (the "Manager"), will assume full operational and managerial control of the Business, which was approved by the NV CCB and became effective June 24, 2024 (the "NV Management Agreement Effective Date"). Of the total Purchase Price, 3.5 million is paid in cash at the closing of the NV Purchase Agreement (the "Closing") and the remaining balance of the Purchase Price is paid on a quarterly basis, beginning three months after the Closing, over 36 months with interest accruing at 8 per annum. 
 As of the NV Purchase Agreement Effective Date, all operational control of GMNV was transferred to the Manager and we determined that we no longer had a controlling financial interest as of the NV Purchase Agreement Effective Date. We recognized a gain on deconsolidation of 2.1 million, which was difference between the aggregate fair value of the consideration and the carrying value of the net liabilities disposed from deconsolidation on the NV Management Agreement Effective Date, which is presented in "interest and other income" on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As the consideration to be received is contingent on the receipt of the approval from the NV CCB, no consideration has been recognized to date. Once the license transfer has been approved and the consideration has been received from the Buyer, we will recognize the associated gains at such time.

Total operating expenses 
 Total operating expenses other than those included in costs and expenses applicable to revenues consist of selling, general, and administrative expenses which are necessary to conduct our ordinary business operations. In addition, total operating expenses consist of marketing, technology, and other growth initiatives related expenses such as opening new dispensaries and building-out our facilities, as well as depreciation and amortization charges taken on our fixed and intangible assets, and any write-downs or impairment on our assets. We have taken the necessary measures to control our discretionary spending and employ capital as efficiently as possible. After normalizing for one-time items, we expect total operating expenses to remain consistent over the remainder of 2024 as we continue to employ a disciplined capital allocation approach and continue to closely monitor operating expenditures and discretionary spending. 
 Total other income and expenses 
 Total other income and expenses include income and expenses that are not included in the ordinary day-to-day activities of our business. This includes the impact of any debt extinguishments, interest and accretion expenses on our financing arrangements, fair value gains or losses on our financial instruments, and income earned from arrangements that are not from our ordinary revenue streams of retail, wholesale, or the delivery of cannabis products. 
 Income tax expense 
 As a company operating in the federally illegal cannabis industry, we are subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E Section 280E under which taxpayers are only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product and no other ordinary business expenses. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and varies from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences, the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and domestic jurisdictions, including changes in enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the period, changes in our valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets and favorable or unfavorable resolution of various tax examinations. 
 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Restated and adjusted) 
 Eastern region 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our sales revenues in the eastern region were 31.7 million as compared to 30.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 5.5 . The main drivers for the increase in revenues are attributable to the higher wholesale revenues from increased demand in New Jersey, and higher retail revenues in New York from increased marketing and promotions offered during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by lower revenues in Florida, driven by increased competition in the state resulting in lower selling prices and lower supply following the closure of the outdoor shade house facility, increased competition leading to lower retail revenues in Maryland, and in Massachusetts, due to labor challenges resulting in temporary store closures at the certain dispensaries during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 14.7 million, or 46.3 of sales revenues, as compared to a gross profit of 8.8 million, or 29.4 of sales revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to lower material costs and a more favorable sales mix from increased volume of higher margin products sold in both Maryland and New Jersey during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, gross profit increased due to significantly lower costs in Massachusetts, attributed to improved operating efficiencies at the Fall River facility, with production volumes normalized and focused on producing more in-house products compared to third-party brands during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, where we had fewer production runs and incurred increased costs during the wind down of the Holliston facility and relocation to Fall River facility. Further, we incurred no inventory reserves during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.6 million during three months ended September 30, 2023, on expired inventory in Massachusetts as we continue to optimize the use of our two facilities within the state. This was partially offset by higher sales discounts offered to customers in New York, to remain competitive in the markets and higher cultivation and production costs in Florida resulting from lower inventory output, following the closure of the outdoor shade house facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 8,750 pounds of plant material was harvested in the eastern region as compared to approximately 8,565 pounds harvested during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in harvested plant material is primarily attributable to the ramp-up in cultivation and production activities in New Jersey, following the launch of the adult-use program in July 2023, and improved production activities at the Fall River facility in Massachusetts during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was offset by decreases in harvested plant material in Florida, as cultivation volumes dropped as a result of the closure of the outdoor shade house facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Western region 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our sales revenues in the western region were 8.6 million as compared to 12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 33.1 . The decrease in revenues in the western region is attributable to lower demand in Arizona, resulting from increased competitive pressures, including higher discounts to improve customer retention during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, operations from our Nevada operations were deconsolidated as of June 24, 2024 following the sale of assets to an unaffiliated third-party, and therefore no revenue was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 3.4 million, or 39.6 of sales revenues, as compared to a gross profit of 4.5 million, or 35.1 of sales revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Despite the lower gross profit dollars attributed to the decrease in revenue, the increase in gross margin is attributable to a favorable sales mix from increased sales from higher margin medical products in Arizona, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 710 pounds of plant material was harvested in the western region as compared to approximately 1,480 pounds harvested during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is attributed to Nevada, with no harvests from our Nevada facility following the deconsolidation of the business on June 24, 2024. Additionally, harvests in Arizona decreased marginally, as a result lower demand in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other revenues and other gross profits 
 We recognized no other revenues or gross profits during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Total operating expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total operating expenses were 19.3 million as compared to 21.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 11.6 . 
 38 

Table of Contents 

The decrease in total operating expenses resulted from a decrease of 0.2 million in our selling, general, and administrative expenses which is attributable to: 0.1 million decrease in employee salaries and benefits from reduced headcount during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 0.9 million decrease in other general corporate expenditures, relating to lower insurance, recruiting and banking expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in legal, marketing and other professional fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a less than 0.1 million increase in share-based compensation from the grant of RSUs to certain employees during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in total operating expenses is also attributable to a 0.5 million decrease in our depreciation and amortization expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We had a lower depreciable fixed and intangible asset base, as certain property, plant and equipment became fully depreciated. 
 Further, the decrease in total operating expenses decreased from a 1.9 million increase in recoveries, write-downs and other charges, net which was attributable to a 2.2 million gain recognized from the disposal of the Purchased Assets in Massachusetts, partially offset by additional credit loss provisions of 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to immaterial write-downs and other charges during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total other income and expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total other expenses were 4.7 million as compared to total other expenses of 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 11.9 . 
 The increase in total other expenses between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily attributable to a 0.3 million increase in interest expense, attributable to the Secured and Unsecured Debentures interest which are paid-in-kind and therefore, each subsequent quarter will accrue higher interest as the principal balance increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 0.2 million increase in accretion expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, relating to the original 11.0 million of senior secured bridge notes (the "Senior Secured Bridge Notes") which were amended in February 2024, and a 0.1 million fair value loss from trading securities held by us during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The total increase in total other expenses was partially offset from a 0.1 million increase in interest and other income, mainly attributed to rental income, license fees for the use of our production facilities, and ATM revenues collected from our various store locations during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax expense was 5.6 million as compared to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 12.0 . The decrease in income tax expense is attributable to certain non-deductible items and mix of our pre-tax income across various jurisdictions, impacting our effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Restated and adjusted) 
 Eastern region 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our sales revenues in the eastern region were 94.3 million as compared to 76.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 22.6 . The main drivers for the increase in revenues are from the launch of our adult-use programs in both Maryland and New Jersey in July 2023. Further, retail revenues increased in Florida and New York from increased marketing and promotions offered in these markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was offset by lower revenues in Massachusetts, as a result of increased competition leading to lower revenues and labor challenges which led to temporary store closures at the certain dispensaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 44.3 million, or 47.0 of sales revenues, as compared to a gross profit of 32.8 million, or 42.6 of sales revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margins increased in Maryland and New Jersey as we continue to produce and sell more higher margin in-house products to meet adult-use demand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

In addition, gross profit increased due to lower costs in Massachusetts, attributed to improved operating efficiencies at the Fall River facility, with production volumes normalized and focused on producing more in-house products compared to third-party brands during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, where we had fewer production runs and incurred increased costs during the wind down of the Holliston facility and relocation to Fall River facility. Further, we incurred no inventory reserves during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, on expired inventory in Massachusetts as we continue to optimize the use of our two facilities within the state. This was partially offset by higher sales discounts offered to customers in New York, to remain competitive in the markets and higher cultivation and production cost in Florida resulting from lower inventory output, following the closure of the outdoor shade house facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 37,440 pounds of plant material was harvested in the eastern region as compared to approximately 26,760 pounds harvested during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was an increase in harvested plant material in New Jersey primarily attributable to increased cultivation and production activities, following the commencement of adult-use operations at the Pleasantville facility in July 2023 and in Florida to meet increased demand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In Massachusetts, harvested plant material decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as only our Fall River facility was operational during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to harvests from both Fall River and Holliston facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Western region 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our sales revenues in the western region were 30.6 million as compared to 41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 25.9 . The decrease in revenues in the western region is attributable to lower retail revenues in Arizona, attributed to a reduced demand arising from increased competition throughout the state during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, we deconsolidated our Nevada operations as of June 24, 2024, further reducing revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 11.7 million, or 38.2 of sales revenues, as compared to a gross profit of 14.8 million, or 35.8 of sales revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower gross profit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is attributed to lower demand, given the highly competitive market in Arizona and from deconsolidation of our Nevada business as of June 24, 2024. Alternatively, the increase in gross profit margin is attributable to a reduction in inventory costs through the purchase of lower priced supplies and from the sale of higher margin medical products in Arizona during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the Nevada business was operating at a loss, and therefore the increase in gross profit margin is attributable to fewer gross losses from the Nevada business following its deconsolidation. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 3,610 pounds of plant material was harvested in the western region as compared to approximately 5,720 pounds harvested during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is attributed to lower production activity in Nevada, as the facility was deconsolidated as of June 24, 2024 compared to harvests for the full nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, harvests in Arizona also decreased as a result lower demand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other revenues and other gross profits 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other revenues was Nil as compared to 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and other gross profits was Nil as compared to a negative 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in other revenues and other gross profits is due to the deconsolidation of our CBD business as of May 8, 2023.

This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 0.2 million relating in travel expenses and a 0.2 million increase in facility, insurance and technology costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in total operating expenses is also attributable to a 1.7 million decrease in our depreciation and amortization expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have a lower depreciable fixed asset base, as certain items of plant and equipment are now fully depreciated, net of any capital additions. 
 Further, the decrease in total operating expenses is attributable to a 1.2 million increase in recoveries, write-downs and other charges, net mainly from a 2.2 million gain recognized from the disposal of the Purchased Assets in Massachusetts and a 0.1 million gain recognized on an early termination of a lease, partially offset by additional credit loss provisions of 0.8 million and settlement costs of 0.3 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to immaterial write downs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total other income and expenses

 The decrease in total other income and expenses between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is attributable to: 1.2 million decrease in loss on debt extinguishment related to the February 16, 2024 amendment (the "2024 NJ Amendment") to the Senior Secured Bridge Notes, which resulted in a loss of 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an amendment fee for the Senior Secured Bridge Notes of 1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the first amendment of the NJ Senior Secured Notes in February 2023; a 3.2 million increase in interest and other income, mainly attributed to a 2.1 million gain on deconsolidation of our Nevada operations, 0.8 million in income from ATM revenues and license fees, 0.6 million gain from certain vendor accruals and foreign currency translations, partially offset by a 0.2 million loss on our investment in an associate and 0.2 million decrease in in rental income from sublease arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The total decrease in total other expenses was partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in interest expense, attributable to the Secured and Unsecured Debentures interest which are paid-in-kind and therefore, each subsequent quarter will accrue higher interest as the principal balance increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; a 0.5 million increase in accretion expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relating to the amended NJ Senior Secured Bridge Notes which was renewed in February 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and a loss of less than 0.1 million from changes in fair value on certain financial instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held unrestricted cash of 19.9 million (December 31, 2023 13.1 million), an accumulated deficit of 1,363.1 million (December 31, 2023 1,327.6 million) and a working capital deficit of 31.4 million (December 31, 2023 79.9 million). In assessing our liquidity, we monitor our cash on-hand and our expenditures required to execute our day-to-day operations and our long-term strategic plans. To date, we have financed our operations through equity and debt financings and from our cash flows from operations, and we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and capital plans in the future. We expect to finance these activities through a combination of additional financings, divestitures of certain assets and cash flows from our operations. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds when needed and on favorable terms, or at all, which may have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to curtail or cease our operations. Furthermore, our outstanding debt instruments impose certain restrictions on our operating and financing activities, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, grant liens, make certain dividends and other payment restrictions affecting our subsidiaries, issue shares or convertible securities and sell certain assets. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future plans, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions and/or for strategic opportunities and initiatives. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue to operate as a going concern, and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital, our ability to achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations, and our ability to obtain the necessary capital to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities when they become due. 
 While we believe that we have funding necessary for us to continue as a going concern, we may need to raise additional capital and there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. As such, these material circumstances cast substantial doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of no less than 12 months from the date of this report, and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently plan due to incorrect assumptions or due to a decision to expand our activities beyond those currently planned. 
 Cash Flow for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 (Restated and adjusted) 
 Operating Activities 
 Our net cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors, including revenues generated by operations, increases or decreases in our operating expenses, including expenses related to development and expansion of newly acquired businesses and the level of cash collections from our customers. 
 Net cash provided from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.7 million as compared to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our net cash provided from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to the following: our net loss of 35.4 million, partially offset by 18.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense, 12.7 million in interest expense, 1.7 million in share-based compensation expense, 3.4 million of accretion expense, 2.1 million gain from deconsolidation from our Nevada operations, 0.1 million in loss on debt extinguishment from the amendment of our Senior Secured Bridge Notes, 0.2 million loss on our equity method investment; 0.2 million from additional inventory reserves, 1.2 million in recoveries, write-downs and other charges, net from 2.2 million gain recognized from the disposal of Holliston assets and 0.1 million gain recognized on the early termination of a lease, partially offset by additional credit loss provisions of 0.8 million and settlement costs of 0.3 million, and 12.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in other operating assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include a marginal increase in inventory of less than 0.1 million, due to increased production volumes in Maryland and New Jersey, partially offset by the Nevada deconsolidation and lower production volumes in both Massachusetts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in accounts receivable of 0.8 million from higher wholesale revenues and timing of collections during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in prepaid expenses of 0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. mainly relating to the timing of renewals for insurance and rent, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Changes in other operating liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include an increase in uncertain tax position liabilities of 62.0 million due to certain accrued income taxes being recognized as an uncertain tax position during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in accrued and other current liabilities of 63.2 million from additional accrued income taxes and certain amended tax liabilities being reclassified to uncertain tax positions, and a decrease in accounts payable of 5.8 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As we continue to expand our operations and as these operations become more established, we continue to expect cash flow to be provided from operations, and we intend to place less reliance on financing from other sources to fund our operations. Although, we expect to continue to have positive cash flows from operations for the remainder of 2024, no assurance can be given that we will have positive cash flows in the future. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.8 million as compared to 4.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower capital spend related to acquisition of adult-use licenses in Maryland and New Jersey and renewal fees in Florida during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Further, we contributed 0.3 million to our investments in associates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 In addition, we received 0.5 million as a portion of proceeds for the sale of Purchased Assets in Massachusetts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.3 million of proceeds from the sale of our cultivation and dispensary assets in Colorado during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 0.1 million on our employees' behalf as part of RSUs issuances as compared to 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Further, we repaid less than 0.1 million of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 Upon the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, certain of our lenders held greater than 5 of the voting interests in our Company and therefore are classified as related parties. For further discussion, refer to Note 4 of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Effective as of October 11, 2023 (the "October Resignation Date"), Robert Galvin, our then-Interim Chief Operating Officer, resigned from his executive positions, including all positions with our subsidiaries and affiliates. In connection with the resignation, we executed a separation agreement (the "October Separation Agreement"), pursuant to which, Mr. Galvin will receive certain compensation and benefits valued to substantially equal the value of entitlements he would have received under Section 4(f) of his employment agreement. Specifically, Mr. Galvin will receive: (i) total cash compensation in the amount of approximately 0.4 million, which was paid in a lump sum on January 5, 2024; (ii) a grant of RSUs with an aggregate fair market value of approximately 0.4 million, which vested fully on January 4, 2024. Under the terms of the October Separation Agreement, we will continue to pay the monthly premium for Mr. Galvin's continued participation in the Company s health and dental insurance benefits pursuant to COBRA for one year from the October Resignation Date. Mr. Galvin served in a consulting role for three months following the October Resignation Date at a base compensation rate of 25 per month. As of September 30, 2024, the total balance owed to Mr. Galvin is Nil (December 31, 2023 - 0.4 million).

Effective as of April 5, 2024 (the "Faraut Resignation Date"), Philippe Faraut, our then-Chief Financial Officer, resigned from his executive positions, including all positions with our subsidiaries and affiliates. in connection with the resignation, we and Mr. Faraut executed a separation agreement (the "Faraut Separation Agreement"), pursuant to which, Mr. Faraut will receive certain compensation and benefits valued to substantially equal the value of entitlements he would have received under Section 4(g) of his employment agreement. Specifically, Mr. Faraut will receive total cash compensation in the amount of approximately 0.2 million, which is payable in equal installments of approximately 25 per month over a period of 7 months following the Effective Date (as defined in the Faraut Separation Agreement). Under the terms of the Faraut Separation Agreement, we will continue to pay the monthly premium for Mr. Faraut's continued participation in the Company's health and dental insurance benefits pursuant to COBRA for one year from the Faraut Resignation Date. Mr. Faraut will serve in a consulting role for one month following the Faraut Resignation Date at a base compensation rate of 25 per month. Pursuant to the Faraut Separation Agreement, the RSUs granted to Mr. Faraut on November 23, 2022 and May 17, 2023 shall accelerate and fully vest upon satisfactory completion of Mr. Faraut's consulting services. Further, the RSUs granted to Mr. Faraut on September 1, 2023 and November 15, 2023 were forfeited as of the Faraut Resignation Date. As of September 30, 2024, the total balance owed to Mr. Faraut is less than 0.1 million (December 31, 2023 - Nil). 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Secured Debenture Purchase Agreement (the "Secured DPA"), dated as of June 24, 2022, with ICM, the other Credit Parties (as defined in the Secured DPA), the collateral agent, and the New Secured Lenders, we have a related party payable of 6.3 million due to certain of the New Secured Lenders, including Gotham Green Fund 1, L.P., Gotham Green Fund 1 (Q), L.P., Gotham Green Fund II, L.P., Gotham Green Fund II (Q), L.P., Oasis Investment Master II Fund LTD., Senvest Global (KY), LP, Senvest Master Fund, LP and Hadron Healthcare and Consumer Special Opportunities Master Fund, for certain out-of-pocket costs, charges, fees, taxes and other expenses incurred by the New Secured Lenders in connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction (the Deferred Professional Fees ). These New Secured Lenders held greater than 5.0 of the outstanding common shares of the Company upon the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction and are therefore considered to be related parties. We had until December 31, 2022, to pay the Deferred Professional Fees ratably based on the amount of each New Secured Lender s Deferred Professional Fees. The Deferred Professional Fees accrued simple interest at the rate of 12.0 from the Closing Date until December 31, 2022. Beginning with the first business day of the month following December 31, 2022, interest shall accrue on the Deferred Professional Fees at the rate of 20.0 calculated on a daily basis and is payable on the first business day of every month until the Deferred Professional Fees and accrued interest thereon is paid in full. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding related party portion of the Deferred Professional Fees including accrued interest was 8.9 million (December 31, 2023 8.0 million). The related party balance is presented in accrued and other current liabilities on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Pursuant to the terms of 2024 NJ Amendment, interest accruing after February 16, 2024 will be payable in cash on the last day of each fiscal quarter (the first such interest payment date being May 16, 2024). As of September 30, 2024 the outstanding related party portion of the interest payable was 0.2 million (December 31, 2023 - Nil) presented in accrued and other current liabilities on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 Our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 During this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there has been a change in accounting policy as described in Note 1(i) "Organization and Description of Business" of the Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 related to income taxes. There have been no other changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the date upon which we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the SEC.

JOBS Act 
 On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 
 We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 
 Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation, with respect to (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities under an effective registration statement under the Securities Act which would be December 31, 2027; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 The Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses, which could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data. Such weaknesses include: (1) Our internal controls relating to financial reporting for inventory, including inventory valuation and consolidation of inventory, (2) Information technology general controls related to access security were not designed and implemented for all financially relevant applications during the audit period. Additionally, we did not perform reviews of relevant Service Organization Control Reports for key third party service providers; (3) We did not perform an effective risk assessment or monitor internal controls over financial reporting. We lacked sufficient resources to adequately perform and monitor account reconciliation and review controls. 
 We have developed a plan to remediate the material weaknesses, which includes implementing improved processes and internal controls to ensure the proper application of accounting practices and guidance. In addition, we intend to dedicate accounting resources to assessing our existing internal controls and to develop a plan to remediate these material weaknesses. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as set forth in this Item 1 of Part II or in Item 1 of Part I, "Financial Statements Note 10 - Contingencies and Guarantees", or in Item 3 of Part I, "Legal Proceedings", of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 Roberts Matter 
 In October 2018, Craig Roberts and Beverly Roberts (the Roberts and the Gary W. Roberts Irrevocable Trust Agreement I, Gary W. Roberts Irrevocable Trust Agreement II, and Gary W. Roberts Irrevocable Trust Agreement III (the Roberts Trust and together with the Roberts, the Roberts Plaintiffs filed two separate but similar declaratory judgment actions in the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County, Florida against GrowHealthy Holdings, LLC GrowHealthy Holdings and the Company in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of GrowHealthy Holdings assets by the Company in early 2018. The Roberts Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Company must deliver certain share certificates to the Roberts without requiring them to deliver a signed Shareholder Representative Agreement SRA to GrowHealthy Holdings, which delivery was a condition precedent to receiving the Company share certificates and required by the acquisition agreements between GrowHealthy Holdings and the Company. In January 2019, the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County denied the Roberts Plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief, and the Roberts Plaintiffs signed and delivered the SRA forms to GrowHealthy Holdings while reserving their rights to continue challenging the validity and enforceability of the SRA. The Roberts Plaintiffs thereafter amended their complaints to seek monetary damages in the aggregate amount of 22.0 million plus treble damages. On May 21, 2019, the court issued an interlocutory order directing the Company to deliver the share certificates to the Roberts Plaintiffs, which the Company delivered on June 17, 2019, in accordance with the court s order. On December 19, 2019, the Company appealed the court s order directing delivery of the share certificates to the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal, which appeal was denied per curiam. On October 21, 2019, the Roberts Plaintiffs were granted leave by the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County to amend their complaints in order to add purported claims for civil theft and punitive damages, and on November 22, 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the Roberts Plaintiffs amended complaints. On May 1, 2020, the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County heard arguments on the motions to dismiss, and on June 11, 2020, the court issued a written order granting in part and denying in part the Company s motion to dismiss. Specifically, the order denied the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue; however, the court granted the Company s motion to dismiss the Roberts Plaintiffs claims for specific performance, conversion and civil theft without prejudice. With respect to the claim for conversion and civil theft, the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County provided the Roberts Plaintiffs with leave to amend their respective complaints. On July 10, 2020, the Roberts Plaintiffs filed further amended complaints in each action against the Company including claims for conversion, breach of contract and civil theft including damages in the aggregate amount of 22.0 million plus treble damages, and on August 13, 2020, the Company filed a consolidated motion to dismiss such amended complaints. On October 26, 2020, Circuit Court of Palm Beach County heard argument on the consolidated motion to dismiss, denied the motion and entered an order to that effect on October 28, 2020. Answers on both actions were filed on November 20, 2020 and the parties commenced discovery. On September 9, 2021, the Roberts Plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate the two separate actions, which motion was granted on October 14, 2021. On August 6, 2020, the Roberts filed a lawsuit against Randy Maslow, the Company s now former Interim Chief Executive Officer, President and director, in his individual capacity (the Maslow Complaint ), alleging a single count of purported conversion. The Maslow Complaint was not served on Randy Maslow until November 25, 2021, and the allegations in the Maslow Complaint are substantially similar to those allegations for purported conversion in the complaints filed against the Company. On March 28, 2022, the court consolidated the action filed against Randy Maslow with the Roberts Plaintiffs action for discovery and trial purposes. As a result, the court vacated the matter s initial trial date of May 9, 2022. On April 22, 2022, the parties attended a court required mediation, which was unsuccessful. On May 6, 2022, the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County granted Randy Maslow s motion to dismiss the Maslow Complaint. On May 19, 2022, the Roberts filed a second amended complaint against Mr. Maslow Amended Maslow Complaint ). On June 3, 2022, Mr. Maslow filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Maslow Complaint, which was denied on September 9, 2022. 
 On April 12, 2023, the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County initially set this matter for a jury trial to occur sometime between June 5, 2023 and August 11, 2023, but the court rescheduled the jury trial and did not set a new trial date. On April 14, 2023, the Roberts Plaintiffs filed a partial Motion for Summary Judgment on liability for the Roberts Plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract and the Company filed a competing Motion for Summary Judgment on all claims against the Company. On April 21, 2023, Mr. Maslow also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. All of the motions remain pending. On February 27, 2024, the Roberts Plaintiffs filed a Notice for Jury Trial with the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County, notifying the court that the matter was ready to be set for trial. On April 19, 2024, the Roberts Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Speedy Trial due to the ages and health of the Roberts Plaintiffs. On May 14, 2024, the court issued a scheduling order that, among other things, set this matter for a jury trial to occur sometime between October 21, 2024 and December 27, 2024; however, due to competing schedules of the parties, the court elected to specially set the trial. On October 15, 2024, the court issued an order specially setting the trial to begin on January 14, 2025.

Claim by Maryland License Holder 
 On May 23, 2022, CGX Life Sciences, Inc. CGX ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a demand for arbitration (the CGX Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association AAA against LMS Wellness Benefit LLC LMS and its 100 owner, William Huber Huber and together with LMS, the Defendants for various breaches under the option agreements entered into between CGX and LMS, on the one hand, and CGX and Huber on the other (collectively, the Option Agreements ). Specifically, CGX is seeking: (i) an order finding the Defendants in breach of the Option Agreements and directing specific performance by the Defendants of their obligations under the Option Agreements to complete the sale and transfer of LMS to CGX; (ii) an order either tolling or extending the closing date under the Option Agreements; (ii) an order requiring Huber to restore LMS bank account of all sums withdrawn for the payment of contracts entered into in breach of the Option Agreements; and (iii) an order prohibiting Huber from withdrawing any further funds from LMS bank account. On June 8, 2022, the Defendants filed an Answering Statement, denying the allegations raised by CGX and sent a notice to CGX, purporting to terminate the Option Agreements. 
 In addition, on June 8, 2022, LMS filed a demand for arbitration (the S8 Arbitration with the AAA against S8 Management, LLC S8 ), alleging that S8 breached the Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement (the MSA entered into between LMS and S8 on March 12, 2018. On June 24, 2022, the Defendants filed Motion to Consolidate the CGX Arbitration and S8 Arbitration. On July 5, 2022, CGX filed an opposition to the Defendants Motion to Consolidate and a cross-Motion to Stay the S8 Arbitration to allow the CGX Arbitration to proceed first. On July 26, 2022, the parties attended a preliminary conference with the arbitrator, at which conference the arbitrator preliminarily granted the Defendants Motion to Consolidate and denied CGX s cross-Motion to Stay the S8 Arbitration. On October 7, 2022, CGX filed a dispositive motion for specific performance of Defendants obligations to complete the sale of LMS to CGX (claims (i) and (ii), above), which Defendants opposed. On October 31, 2022, the arbitrator granted CGX s dispositive motion and ordered Defendants to complete the sale of LMS to CGX. The remaining claims asserted in the CGX Arbitration (claims (iii) and (iv), above). On November 30, 2022, the Defendants filed a Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award and CGX filed its opposition on January 30, 2023. On February 3, 2023, the Defendants requested a hearing on the Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County scheduled a hearing on the Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award for February 21, 2024, and on March 4, 2024, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County denied Defendants' Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. On April 8, 2024, the Defendants submitted the required ownership transfer paperwork to the Maryland Cannabis Administration (the "MCA") to request approval of the transfer of ownership of LMS to CGX following the denial of the Defendants' Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. Also on April 8, 2024, the Defendants requested that the MCA either deny the ownership transfer of LMS to CGX, or delay their consideration of the request until the S8 Arbitration is complete. On April 22, 2024, the MCA notified the parties that it will wait to consider the request to transfer ownership of LMS to CGX until the S8 Arbitration is complete. Beginning on July 15, 2024, the parties attended a hearing regarding claims (iii) and (iv) in the CGX Arbitration and the claims in the S8 Arbitration. The parties filed post-hearing briefs on August 27, 2024 and oral argument regarding the post-hearing briefs was held on September 16, 2024. On September 24, 2024, the arbitrator issued his final award, in which he denied the claims of all parties in the CGX Arbitration and S8 Arbitration. Now that the CGX Arbitration and S8 Arbitration are complete, CGX continues to pursue regulatory approval of the transfer of ownership of LMS to CGX from the MCA. 
 On June 20, 2023, LMS filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against the Company and three wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the "iAnthus Defendants"), alleging conversion, RICO violations and unjust enrichment and seeking damages in excess of 4.5 million, plus treble damages (the "Federal Complaint"). The allegations in the Federal Complaint appear substantially similar to, and appear to arise from substantially the same operative facts as, those alleged by LMS in the CGX Arbitration, the S8 Arbitration, and in support of the Defendants' Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award. The iAnthus Defendants deny LMS s allegations alleging unlawful conduct. The iAnthus Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss (Or Stay the Proceedings) the Federal Complaint on September 11, 2023. On March 12, 2024, the Court granted the iAnthus Defendants' motion and administratively stayed the Federal Complaint pending the outcome of the CGX Arbitration and the S8 Arbitration. On November 1, 2024, LMS filed a voluntary notice of dismissal, dismissing the Federal Complaint. On November 4, 2024, the court ordered that LMS s notice of dismissal be adopted and further ordered that the Federal Complaint be dismissed.
