Dividend yield 

Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company's stock price in USD as reflected on the OTCQX. In prior periods, the Company s fair value calculations for stock options were consistently reported in USD. However, the stock price assumption used in calculating the fair value was previously stated in CAD. Effective as of the current period, the stock price assumption has been updated to reflect a USD-denominated stock price for consistency in financial reporting. The fair value amounts reported in prior periods remain unchanged, as the fair value itself has always been presented in USD. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively.

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion sets forth certain components of the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as well as factors that impact those items. 
 
 Revenue, net 
 
 The Company generates revenue from the sale of cannabis products, brands, and services to the U.S. and Canadian markets. Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales in the legal medical and adult-use market across Canada and in several U.S. states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or adult-use cannabis. 
 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to providing cannabis products and services to the Company's customers, including personnel-related expenses, the depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of acquired intangible assets, certain royalties, and other overhead costs. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 General and administrative 
 
 General and administrative ("G A") expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to finance, human resources, legal, certain royalties, and other administrative functions. Additionally, G A expenses include professional fees to third parties, as well as marketing expenses. Moreover, G A expenses includes share-based compensation on options, restricted stock units and warrants. The Company expects that G A expenses will increase in absolute dollars as the business grows. 
 
 Amortization and depreciation 
 
 Amortization and depreciation includes the amortization of intangible assets. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following terms: 

Brand intangibles- indefinite lives 
 Indefinite useful lives 

Brand intangibles- definite lives 
 3 years 

Software 
 5 years 

Licenses 
 5-30 years 

Non-compete agreements 
 3 years 

29 

Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: 

Buildings and improvements 
 15-30 years 

Land 
 Not depreciated 

Machinery equipment 
 5-15 years 

Office furniture production equipment 
 3-5 years 

Right of use assets 
 Lease term 

Assets in process 
 Not depreciated 

Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
 
 Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. The Company first performs a qualitative assessment. If based on the results of a qualitative assessment it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, an additional quantitative impairment test is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. 
 
 Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. 
 
 Impairment of property and equipment and right of use assets 
 
 The Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment and right of use assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. 
 
 Other operating expense (income) 
 
 Other operating expense (income) primarily represents (gains) losses on lease terminations and (gains) losses on disposal of fixed assets. 
 
 Loss (gain) from revaluation of contingent consideration 
 
 As a result of some of its acquisitions, the Company recognizes a contingent consideration payable, which is an obligation to transfer additional assets to the seller if future events occur. The liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period to determine its fair value. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. 
 
 (Gain) loss on fair value of derivative liabilities and purchase option derivative assets 
 
 The Company issues warrants that are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting unit using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. 
 
 Finance and other expenses 
 
 Finance and other expenses consist primarily of interest and accretion expense on the Company's outstanding debt obligations. 
 
 Transaction and restructuring costs 
 
 Transaction costs include costs incurred in connection with the Company's acquisitions, such as expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal and accounting. Restructuring costs are those costs associated with severance and restructuring of business units. 
 
 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss 
 
 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss represents the (gain) loss recognized on the remeasurement of USD denominated 
 30 

cash and other assets recorded in the Canadian dollars functional currency at the Company's Canadian operations. 
 
 Unrealized and realized (gain) loss on investments 
 
 The Company accounts for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt represents the Company's debt that was retired prior to its scheduled maturity at a different amount than the book value and the amount paid. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 Provision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business.

 Liquidity and going concern 
 
 The Company previously concluded that substantial doubt existed as to its ability to continue as a going concern primarily due to the Company's current liabilities exceeding its current assets related to its loans maturing within the current year. During the period ended on September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a four-year 140,000 senior secured term loan which was primarily used to retire a majority of the Company's loans coming due within the next year. See Note 10 for more information regarding the refinancing. 
 
 Following the retiring and financing of the Company s loans coming due within the next year, along with its ability to identify access to future capital, and continued improvement in cash flow from the Company's consolidated operations, management has determined that substantial doubt no longer exists in the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Since its inception, the Company's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt facilities, and the Company has received aggregate net proceeds from such transactions totaling 782,388 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company expects to fund any additional future requirements through the following sources of capital: 
 cash from ongoing operations. 

market offerings. 

additional debt from additional creditors. 

sale of real property. 

sale leaseback transactions. 

exercise of options and warrants. 

Capital requirements 
 The Company has 205,733 in principal amounts of loans payable at September 30, 2024. Of this amount, 8,387 are due within the next twelve months. 
 The Company has entered into leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. The Company has 89,849 in lease obligations. Of this amount, 9,402 are due in the next twelve months. 
 The Company's undiscounted contingent consideration payable is 4,373 at September 30, 2024, of which, 2,546 is due in the next twelve months. The contingent consideration payable relates to the Company's acquisitions of Peninsula and the remaining 50.1 equity in both State Flower and three Apothecarium dispensaries in California. The contingent considerations are based upon the price protection of Common Shares issued under the terms of the applicable acquisition agreements. The contingent considerations are measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes Model and revalued at the end of each reporting period. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 46,381 and corporate income taxes payable of 11,075. 
 
 35 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition, including and without limitation, such consideration as liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 The Company intends to meet its capital commitments through any or all of the sources of capital noted above. The Company's objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance future obligations.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and the Company calculates: (i) Free cash flow from net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures for property and equipment which management believes is an important measurement of the Company's ability to generate additional cash from its business operations, and (ii) EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as net loss, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, finance expenses, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss (gain) from revaluation of contingent consideration, loss (gain) on disposal of fixed assets, impairment of property and equipment and right of use assets, bad debt recovery, unrealized and realized loss on investments, (gain) loss on lease termination and derecognition of finance lease, unrealized and realized foreign exchange, gain on fair value of derivative liabilities and purchase option derivative assets, Employee Retention Credits and Transfer Fee, and certain other items, which management believes is not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance of the Company.

Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful performance measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful ongoing operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of the Company s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses.

 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's future financial statements will be affected. 
 
 There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 
 The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ).

As a result, the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 
 The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) December 31, 2027 (a) in which the Company has total annual gross revenue of 1,235,000 or more, or (b) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the Company's Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700,000 as of the last business day of the Company s most recent second fiscal quarter; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than 1,000,000 in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company's management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION

 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company s consolidated financial statements, except for the proceedings described below.

 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 
 Investing in the Company's Common Shares involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1.A. Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report. The Company may disclose changes to risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in its future filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may impair its business operations. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report. 
 
 The Company cannot guarantee that the share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of the Company s Common Shares and could diminish our cash reserves. 
 
 While the Company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program, the program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or acquire any specific number of Common Shares. The actual timing and number of shares repurchased remains subject to a variety of factors, including share price, trading volume, market conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements, and other general business considerations. The share repurchase program expires on August 21, 2025, and the 
 43 

Company cannot guarantee that the share purchase program will be fully utilized or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The Company s failure to repurchase Common Shares after announcing a share repurchase program may negatively impact the Company s share price, reputation, and investor confidence. 
 
 Furthermore, the Company s execution of the share repurchase program could affect the trading price of its Common Stock and increase volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could cause the Company s share price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for the Company's shares. Although the Company's share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of the Company s Common Shares may decline below the levels at which it repurchases shares, and short-term shares price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program. Repurchasing Common Shares reduces the amount of cash the Company has available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments, other business opportunities, and other general corporate projects, as well as to invest in securities to generate returns on the Company's cash balance. The Company also may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any share repurchase program. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 On August 20, 2024, the Board approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 10,000 of the Company s common shares Shares ). The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 10,000,000 common shares of the Company at any time, or from time to time, from August 22, 2024 until August 21, 2025. The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 65,361 Shares daily, which represents 25 of the Company s average daily trading volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange of 261,445 Shares. Any repurchases under the program may be made by means of open market transactions, negotiated block transactions, or otherwise, including pursuant to a repurchase plan administered in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The size and timing of any repurchases will depend on price, market and business conditions, and other factors. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased Shares as set forth below:

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (d) (plus any

penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.3(d), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 3.3(d) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Taxes subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Taxes had never been paid. This Section 3.3(d) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

Each Borrower expressly represents and acknowledges that any financial accommodations by the Agent or any Lender to any other Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are and will be of direct and indirect interest, benefit and advantage to such Borrower. Each Borrower acknowledges that any notice given by any other Borrower to the Agent or any Lender shall bind each Borrower, and that any notice given by the Agent or any Lender to any Borrower shall be effective with respect to each Borrower. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that each Borrower shall be liable, on a joint and several basis, for the Term Loans and all other Obligations, regardless of which Borrower actually may have received the proceeds of the Term Loans or other extensions of credit or the amount of the Term Loans or other extensions of credit received or the manner in which the Agent or any Lender accounts among the Borrowers for the Term Loans or other Obligations on its books and records, and further acknowledges and agrees that the Term Loans and other extensions of credit to any Borrower inure to the mutual benefit of all of the Borrowers and that each of the Agent and Lenders is relying on the joint and several liability of the Borrowers in extending the Term Loans and other financial accommodations under the Loan Documents. 

(b) Each Borrower shall be entitled to subrogation and contribution rights from and against the other Borrowers to the extent any Borrower is required to pay to the Agent or Lenders any amount in excess of the Term Loans directly to, or other Obligations incurred directly by, such Borrower or as otherwise available under applicable law; provided, however, that such subrogation and contribution rights are and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 3.4(c), 3.4(d), 3.4(f) and 3.4(g). 

(c) Each Borrower, and by its acceptance of this Agreement, each of the Agent and the Lenders hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Agreement and the Obligations of each Borrower hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (the UFCA ), the

To effectuate the foregoing intention, each of the Agent and the Lenders, by its acceptance of this Agreement, and Borrower hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such Borrower under this Agreement not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance (such Borrower s Maximum Borrower Liability ). This Section 3.4(c) is intended solely to preserve the rights hereunder of the Agent, each Lender and any other Person holding any of the Obligations to the maximum extent that would not cause the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder to be subject to avoidance under any Avoidance Provisions, and none of the Borrowers nor any other Person shall have any right, defense, offset, or claim under this Section 3.4(c) as against the Agent, any Lender or any other Person holding any of the Obligations that would not otherwise be available to such Person under the Avoidance Provisions. 

(d) To the extent that any Borrower shall, under this Agreement, make a payment of a portion of the Obligations (each, an Obligor s Payment ), then, without limiting its rights of subrogation against any other Borrower, such Borrower shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each other Borrower and the Guarantors (collectively, the Contributing Parties in an amount, for each such Contributing Party, equal to a fraction of such Obligor s Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such Contributing Party s Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Contributing Parties. As of any date of determination, the Allocable Amount of each Contributing Party shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability which could be asserted against such Contributing Party hereunder with respect to the applicable Obligor s Payment without (i) rendering such Contributing Party insolvent within the meaning of Section 101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 2 of either the UFTA or the UFCA, (ii) leaving such Contributing Party with unreasonably small capital, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (iii) leaving such Contributing Party unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 6 of the UFCA. Each Borrower s right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 3.4(f) and 3.4(g) . The provisions of this Section 3.4 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Borrower to any Secured Creditor, and each Borrower shall remain liable to each Secured Creditor for the full amount guaranteed by such Borrower hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Section 3.4(d) shall limit any Borrower s liability for any portion of the Term Loans advanced directly or indirectly to it under this Agreement. 

(e) Each Borrower agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Borrower Liability of such Borrower and may exceed the aggregate Maximum Borrower Liability of all Borrowers hereunder, without impairing this Agreement or any provision contained herein or affecting the rights and remedies of any Secured Creditor hereunder. 

(f) No Borrower will exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation hereunder or under any other Loan Document or at law by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, nor shall any Borrower seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from any other Borrower in respect of payments made by such Borrower hereunder 

49 

or under any other Loan Document, until all amounts owing to Secured Creditors on account of the Obligations are paid in full in cash (other than inchoate obligations for indemnification or unasserted claims for reimbursement). If any amounts shall be paid to any Borrower on account of such subrogation or contribution rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Borrower in trust for Secured Creditors, segregated from other funds of such Borrower, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Borrower, be turned over to the Agent, for the benefit of Secured Creditors, in the exact form received by such Borrower (duly endorsed by such Borrower to the Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, as provided for herein. 

(g) Nothing in this Section 3.4 shall affect any Borrower s joint and several liability to Secured Creditors for the entire amount of its Obligations. Each Borrower covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution hereunder from a Borrower shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to all obligations of the Borrowers to Secured Creditors under the Loan Documents.

 SECTION 11.7	 Right of Set-off . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Requirements of Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other Debt at any time owing by the Lenders to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under any Loan Document, whether or not the Agent or Lenders shall have made any demand under the Note and although such obligations may be unmatured. The Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, agree to promptly notify the Borrowers after any such set-off and application made by such Lenders, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Lenders under this Section are in addition to other rights 
 92 

and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Lenders may have. 
 SECTION 11.8	 Binding Effect . This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by each Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 
 SECTION 11.9	 Assignments and Participations . 
 (a) Generally . This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Borrower Party and Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that none of Borrower Parties may assign or transfer any of its rights hereunder or under the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of the Agent and any such assignment without Agent s prior written consent shall be null and void. With the prior written consent of the Borrower Representative and the Agent, each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of the Term Loan held by it; provided, however, that (A) the written consent of the Borrower Representative (1) shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (2) shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and (3) shall be deemed given if not positively denied in writing by the Borrower Representative within five (5) Business Days of the date of the written request therefor, (B) no written consent of any Agent or the Borrower Representative shall be required in connection with any assignment by a Lender (1) to an Agent or a Lender, (2) to an Affiliate of an Agent or a Lender (other than an Affiliate that is a Competitor) or (3) during the continuance of an Event of Default, and (C) the written consent of the Agent (1) shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (2) shall be deemed given if not positively denied in writing by the Agent within five (5) Business Days of the date of the written request therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any such assignment be made to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person). 

(b) The lender party to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent, an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit A , via an electronic settlement system acceptable to Agent (or, if previously agreed with Agent, manually), and, shall pay to Agent a processing and recordation fee of Four Thousand Dollars 4,000) (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of Agent). 

(c) Participations . Any Lender may at any time grant to any Person (other than a Competitor, in which case, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the written consent of the Borrower Representative shall be required prior to the sale of any participating interests to any such Person) participating interests in its Commitment or the obligations owing to such Lender hereunder (a Participant ). No Participant shall have any rights or benefits under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any 

93 

amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided however, such Lender may agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase such Lender s Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal on the Term Loan or a portion thereof owing to such Lender, or (iii) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of (and stated interest on) each Participant s interest in the Term Loan or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register and any attempted sale of a participation that is not recorded in accordance with this Section 11.9(c) shall be null and void; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 

(d) Information to Assignee, Etc . A Lender may furnish any information concerning the Property and its operations, Borrower, or Guarantors in the possession of such Lender from time to time to Eligible Assignees and Participants (including prospective assignees and any Related Party thereof); provided, however, that no Lender may not disclose or disseminate Borrower s financial statements (or extracts thereof or information contained in such financial statements) to any other Person or entity outside of such Lender s organization (other than to any Related Party) without the prior written consent of the Borrower Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). In connection with such negotiation, execution and delivery, the Borrowers authorize the Agent and Lenders to communicate all information and documentation related to the Term Loan (whether to the Borrowers or to any assignee, legal counsel, appraiser or other necessary party) directly by e-mail, fax, or other electronic means used to transmit information. 

(e) Cooperation; Costs and Expenses . In connection with any such sale, syndication, assignment or participation, the Borrowers further agree that they shall be responsible for their own costs and expenses in connection with such transaction and that the Loan Documents and other related documents shall be sufficient evidence of the obligations of Borrowers to each purchaser, assignee or participant and upon written request by the Agent, the Borrowers shall enter into such amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents and other related documents as may be reasonably necessary or desirable in order to evidence any such sale, syndication, assignment or participation; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to reimburse or otherwise be liable in any manner in respect of any fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender in connection with any such sale, syndication, assignment or participation of any of the Term Loans. 

(f) Register . The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary Agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its principal office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the 

94 

Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 

SECTION 11.10 Limitation on Agreements . All agreements among the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of demand being made in respect of an amount due under any Loan Document or otherwise, shall the amount paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Lenders for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be loaned under the Note or any other Loan Document or otherwise or for the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other Loan Document exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If, as a result of any circumstance whatsoever, fulfillment of or compliance with any provision hereof or of any of such documents at the time performance of such provision shall be due or at any other time shall involve exceeding the amount permitted to be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by the Lenders under applicable usury or similar law, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled or complied with shall be reduced (firstly by reducing the stated interest rate and thereafter, if and to the extent required, by reducing any other amount comprising interest) to the limit prescribed by such applicable usury or similar law, and if, from any such circumstance, the Lenders shall ever receive interest or anything which might be deemed interest under applicable law which would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on account of the Note or the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrowers to the Lenders under any Loan Document and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of the Note and the amounts owing on other obligations of the Borrowers to the Lenders under any Loan Document, as the case may be, such excess shall be promptly refunded in cash to the Borrowers. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders for the use, forbearance, or detention of the indebtedness of the Borrowers to the Lenders shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full of the principal (including the period of any renewal or extension thereof) so that the interest on account of such indebtedness shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, it is understood and agreed that if at any time the rate of interest which accrues on the outstanding principal balance of the Note shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest which accrues on the outstanding principal balance of the Note shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions in the rate of interest which accrues on the outstanding principal balance of the Note shall not reduce the rate of interest which accrues on the outstanding principal balance of such Note below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued on the outstanding principal balance of the Note, taken in the aggregate, equals the amount of interest which would have accrued if such interest rate had at all times been in effect and not been reduced. In the event that any rate of interest under the Note or any Loan Document is reduced due to the effect of this Section 11.10 and there is a subsequent increase in the Highest Lawful Rate, such interest rate shall, automatically without any action of the Borrowers or Lenders, be increased to the then applicable Highest Lawful Rate; provided that the interest rate shall not exceed the rate set forth in Section 2.3. The terms and provisions of this Section 11.10 shall control and supersede every other provision of all Loan Documents.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic (e.g., pdf or tif format shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. No party hereto or to any other Loan Document shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or digital imaging and electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or digital imaging and electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense. 

(b) The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Loan Document shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 

SECTION 11.16	 Confidentiality .

The Agent s duties hereunder shall be mechanical and administrative in nature. The Agent shall not have by reason hereof a fiduciary relationship with respect to Lenders. The Agent agrees to be bound by Lenders determinations made in connection with the Loan Documents so long as such determinations are made in good faith and in the absence of willful misconduct. Unless indemnified to the satisfaction of the Agent against loss, cost, liability, and expense, the Agent shall be under no duty to enforce any rights, remedies, powers, or privileges with respect to any enforcement of the obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents and shall not be compelled to do any act hereunder or thereunder or to take any action toward the exercise or enforcement of the powers created by this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect hereof or thereof. Agent shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.2 and 11.2), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Agent in writing by a Loan Party or a Lender. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, the Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Required Lenders, provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.

For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to Agent pursuant to this Section 12.9(b) shall not have any effect on a Payment Recipient s obligations pursuant to Section 12.9(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has been made. 
 (c) Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by Agent to such Lender under any Loan Document with respect to any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, against any amount that Agent has demanded to be returned under immediately preceding clause (a).

(b) if the Lenders become liable for any part of such claim by reason of (i) any judgment or order of any court or administrative authority having competent jurisdiction, or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim, 

then the Guarantors shall remain liable under this Agreement for the amounts so repaid or property so returned or the amounts for which the Lenders became liable (such amounts being

Not later than five days after receipt of notice from such the Agent, the Guarantors shall pay to the Agent an amount equal to the amount of such repayment or return for which the Lenders have so become liable.

(e) any act or omission on the part of the Agent or Lenders which may impair or prejudice the rights of such Guarantor, including rights to obtain subrogation, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or any other reimbursement from the Borrowers or any other Person, or otherwise operate as a deemed release or discharge; 

(f) any statute of limitations or any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than the obligation of the principal; 

(g) any single action or anti deficiency law which would otherwise prevent the Lenders from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, against such Guarantor before or after the Agent s or Lenders commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or any other law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Agent or the Lenders;

(d) To collect or liquidate or realize upon any of the Obligations or collateral in any manner or to refrain from collecting or liquidating or realizing upon any of the Obligations or collateral; and 

(e) To extend credit under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise in such amount as the Lenders may determine, including increasing the amount of credit and the interest rate and fees with respect thereto, even though the condition of the Loan Parties (financial or otherwise, on an individual or consolidated basis) may have deteriorated since the date hereof.

The Guarantors agree that, as among themselves in their capacity as guarantors of the Obligations, the ultimate responsibility for repayment of the Obligations, in the event that the Borrowers fail to pay when due their Obligations, shall be equitably apportioned, to the extent consistent with the Loan Documents, among the respective Guarantors (a) in the proportion that each, in its capacity as a guarantor, has benefited from the extensions of credit to the Borrowers by the Lenders under this Agreement, or (b) if such equitable apportionment cannot reasonably be determined or agreed upon among the affected Guarantors, in proportion to their respective net worths determined on or about the date hereof (or such later date as such Guarantor becomes party hereto). In the event that any Guarantor, in its capacity as a guarantor, pays an amount with respect to the Obligations in excess of its proportionate share as set forth in this Section 13.9, each other Guarantor shall, to the extent consistent with the Loan Documents, make a contribution payment to such Guarantor in an amount such that the aggregate amount paid by each Guarantor reflects its proportionate share of the Obligations. In the event of any default by any Guarantor under this Section 13.9, each other Guarantor will bear, to the extent consistent with the Loan Documents, its proportionate share of the defaulting Guarantor s obligation under this Section 13.9. This Section 13.9 is intended to set forth only the rights and obligations of the Guarantors among themselves and shall not in any way affect the obligations of any Guarantor to the Lenders under the Loan Documents (which obligations shall at all times constitute the joint and several obligations of all the Guarantors). 
 SECTION 13.10 Further Assurances. Each Guarantor will, promptly upon the request of Agent from time to time, execute, acknowledge and deliver, and file and record, all such instruments, and take all such action, as the Agent deems necessary or advisable to carry out the intent and purpose of this Article XIII.
