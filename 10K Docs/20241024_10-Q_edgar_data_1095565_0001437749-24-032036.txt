million, which includes a million swingline sub-facility and a million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by a total of up to million, subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of October 6, 2026. 
 
 The Company's obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are unsecured. In addition, if the Company forms or acquires any domestic subsidiaries, the loans and other obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by such domestic subsidiaries. 
 
 At the Company s election, the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, other than the swingline loans, bear interest at either 1 a base rate defined as the highest of (a) the rate which the Administrative Agent announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, as in effect from time to time, or (b) the Federal Funds Rate, as in effect from time to time, plus one -half of one percent per annum (any changes in such rates to be effective as of the date of any change in such rate), plus in each case an applicable margin that varies with the company s funded debt leverage ratio; or 2 a term secured overnight financing rate SOFR defined as the greater of (a)(i) the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR determined as of the reference time for such interest period with a term equivalent to such interest period plus (ii) a term SOFR adjustment equal to per annum and (b) zero, plus, in each case, an applicable margin that varies with the Company s consolidated total leverage ratio. The Company s borrowings under the swingline loans bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin. The initial applicable margin for base rate loans is and the initial applicable margin SOFR loans is . The applicable margins will be adjusted quarterly, in each case two 2 business days after the Administrative Agent's receipt of the Company's quarterly financial statements. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee accruing on the unused revolving commitment, which fee initially is basis points per annum and a letter of credit fee, accruing at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for SOFR loans then in effect on the daily average amount of such lender s letter of credit exposure. 
 
 Principal is payable in full at maturity on October 6, 2026, and there are no scheduled principal payments prior to maturity. Interest on base rate loans and swingline loans is payable quarterly in arrears, and interest on SOFR loans is payable at the end of each interest period, and in the case of interest periods longer than three months, on each day which occurs every three months after the initial date of such interest period. 
 
 The purpose of the Revolving Credit Facility is for general working capital needs, permitted acquisitions (as defined in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement), and for stock repurchase and/or redemption transactions that the Company may authorize. 
 
 In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility required the Company to meet certain financial tests, including, without limitation: 
 
 a funded debt leverage ratio (consolidated debt/consolidated EBITDA) of not greater than to 1.0; and 

an interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA/consolidated interest expense) of not less than to 1.0.

Recent Developments 
 
 Macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. continue to be challenging in various respects, including as the result of inflationary pressures, interest rate levels, which, despite recent declines, remain elevated, and uncertain geopolitical conditions. In this regard, we have experienced in certain recent periods, and believe that many of our customers have experienced, increased labor, supply chain, capital, and other expenditures associated with inflationary conditions. These conditions impacting the U.S. economy and our customers in the healthcare industry have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely impact, our business and results of operations. 
 
 While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause some level of uncertainty, the impact of the pandemic itself on public health and economic conditions has significantly lessened and normalized to the point of reaching an endemic stage. As our business is focused on providing solutions to healthcare organizations, we continue to closely monitor any developments related to COVID-19 or other public health related events and remain prepared to modify our operating approaches to address COVID 19-related developments or other public health related events as they may arise. 
 
 Key Financial Metrics 
 
 Our management utilizes the following financial metrics in connection with managing our business. 

Revenues, net . Revenues, net, reflect income generated by the sales of goods and services related to our operations and, for businesses acquired prior to the adoption of ASU 2021-08 on January 1, 2022, reflects deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for such acquired businesses. Revenues, net, were 73.1 million and 217.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 70.3 million and 208.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Management utilizes revenue in connection with managing our business and believes that this metric provides useful information to investors as a key indicator of the growth and success of our products. 

Net Income . Net income represents revenues, net, less all expenses. Net income was 5.7 million and 15.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 3.9 million and 10.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management utilizes net income in connection with managing our business, including with regard to our capital deployment strategies. 

Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA, calculated as set forth below under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, is utilized by our management in connection with managing our business and provides useful information to investors because adjusted EBITDA reflects net income adjusted for certain GAAP accounting, non-cash, and/or non-operating items, as more specifically set forth below, which may not fully reflect the underlying operating performance of our business. We also believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assess the Company s ongoing operations. Additionally, certain short-term cash incentive bonuses and performance-based equity award grants are based on the achievement of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in applicable bonus and equity grant documentation) targets. Adjusted EBITDA was 17.7 million and 50.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 16.2 million and 45.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Capital Expenditures . Capital expenditures represent cash payments incurred for purchases of property and equipment and during the development phase for projects to develop software and content. Capital expenditures were 6.8 million and 21.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 6.7 million and 21.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Management utilizes this metric in connection with managing the allocation of capitalized expenditures in which the Company invests related to the development of its products and believes that this metric is a key indicator of investment in products relative to their current and expected performance.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions during the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented and related disclosures. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements will be affected. 
 
 The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: 

Revenue recognition 

Accounting for income taxes 

Goodwill 

In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by US GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas where management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K and the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by US GAAP. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those reported in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues, net. Revenues increased 2.8 million, or 4 , to 73.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 70.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Subscription revenues increased 2.5 million, or 4 , and professional services revenues increased by 0.3 million, or 11 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in professional services revenues is primarily due to a one-time payment as a result of a customer acquisition.

Cost of Revenues (excluding Depreciation and Amortization). Cost of revenues increased 0.9 million, or 4 , to 24.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 23.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues were 33 and 34 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense is primarily associated with higher costs for software and cloud hosting as well as an increase in labor costs and royalties. 
 
 Product Development. Product development expenses increased 1.2 million, or 11 , to 12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Product development expenses as a percentage of revenues were 17 and 15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in labor costs, partially offset by an increase in capitalized labor associated with software development activities. 
 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses, including personnel costs, increased 0.2 million, or 2 , to 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expenses were 16 of revenues for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in expense is primarily due to increases in commissions and software expense, which were partially offset by a decrease in labor costs. 
 
 Other General and Administrative Expenses. Other general and administrative expenses decreased 0.8 million, or 9 , to 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other general and administrative expenses were 12 and 13 of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to a 0.4 million recovery of sales taxes from prior software expense payments, partially offset by increased share-based compensation.

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.3 million, or 3 , to 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in amortization associated with capitalized software resulting from the recovery of sales taxes from prior capitalized payments related to contract labor associated with software development activities. 
 
 Other Income, Net . Other income, net was 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in interest income earned on cash and investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income Tax Provision. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate was 23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 29 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate primarily reflects the statutory corporate income tax rate, the net effect of state taxes, foreign income taxes, the effect of various permanent tax differences, and recognition of discrete tax items. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded discrete tax expense of 88,000, which consisted primarily of discrete tax expense related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded discrete tax expense of 0.5 million, which consisted primarily of tax expense in the amount of 0.3 million resulting from the impact of merging VerityStream into HealthStream and 0.1 million related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
 
 Net Income. Net income was 5.7 million and 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. EPS was 0.19 per share (diluted) and 0.13 per share (diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for our reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measure under US GAAP and disclosure regarding why we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues, net. Revenues increased 8.9 million, or 4 , to 217.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 208.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Subscription revenues increased 9.1 million, or 5 , but were partially offset by 0.2 million of declines from professional services revenues.

Cost of Revenues (excluding Depreciation and Amortization). Cost of revenues increased 1.8 million, or 3 , to 72.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 71.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues were 33 and 34 the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense is primarily associated with higher software expenses and cloud hosting costs, partially offset by lower labor costs. Labor costs recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included severance costs incurred in connection with the Company's previously disclosed restructuring under a single platform strategy. 
 
 Product Development. Product development expenses increased 2.6 million, or 8 , to 36.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 33.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Product development expenses as a percentage of revenues were 17 and 16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in labor costs, partially offset by an increase in capitalized labor associated with software development activities. 
 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses, including personnel costs, increased 0.4 million, or 1 , to 34.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expenses were 16 of revenues for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in expense is primarily due to increases in general marketing expenses, commissions, and travel expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in labor costs. 
 
 Other General and Administrative Expenses. Other general and administrative expenses decreased 0.9 million, or 3 , to 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other general and administrative expenses were 12 and 13 of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to lower labor costs, professional service fees, and a 0.4 million recovery of sales taxes from prior software expense payments, which were partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of 1.4 million, which was primarily associated with a single-customer bankruptcy.

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.2 million, or 1 , to 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in amortization associated with capitalized software. 
 
 Other Income, Net . Other income, net was 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in interest income earned on cash and investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income Tax Provision. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate was 22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate primarily reflects the statutory corporate income tax rate, the net effect of state taxes, foreign income taxes, the effect of various permanent tax differences, and recognition of discrete tax items. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded discrete tax expense of 0.1 million, which consisted primarily of discrete tax expense of 0.2 million related to reserves for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a 0.1 million discrete tax benefit associated with stock-based awards. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded discrete tax benefits of 0.1 million, which consisted primarily of tax benefits in the amount of 0.6 million resulting from changes in state apportionment rules in Tennessee upon the enactment of the Tennessee Works Tax Act and stock-based awards in the amount of 0.1 million. This tax benefit was partially offset by 0.3 million of discrete tax expense related to reserves for uncertain tax positions and 0.3 million of discrete tax expenses related to the impact of merging VerityStream into HealthStream. 
 
 Net Income. Net income was 15.1 million and 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. EPS was 0.50 per share (diluted) and 0.35 per share (diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 50.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 45.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This Form 10-Q presents adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in analyzing our financial results and ongoing operational performance. 
 
 In order to better assess the Company s financial results, management believes that net income before interest, income taxes, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and changes in fair value of, including gains (losses) on the sale of, non-marketable equity investments adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because adjusted EBITDA reflects net income adjusted for certain GAAP accounting, non-cash, and/or non-operating items which may not, in any such case, fully reflect the underlying operating performance of our business. In addition, as discussed below, for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2023, adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assess the Company s ongoing operating performance and to compare the Company s operating performance between periods. Additionally, certain short-term cash incentive bonuses and performance-based equity awards are based on the achievement of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in applicable bonus and equity grant documentation) targets. 
 
 As previously disclosed, prior to the Company early adopting ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2022, following the completion of any acquisition by the Company, the Company was required to record the acquired deferred revenue at fair value as defined in GAAP, which typically resulted in a write-down of the acquired deferred revenue. In connection therewith, management determined that including an adjustment in the definition of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for businesses acquired prior to the January 1, 2022 effective date of the Company's adoption of ASU 2021-08 (the Pre-2022 Acquisitions provided useful information to investors because the deferred revenue write-down recognized in periods after any such Pre-2022 Acquisitions could, given the nature of this non-cash accounting impact, cause our GAAP financial results during such periods to not fully reflect our underlying operating performance. Following the adoption of ASU 2021-08, contracts acquired in an acquisition completed on or after January 1, 2022 have been measured as if the Company had originated the contract (rather than the contract being measured at fair value) such that, for such acquisitions, the Company no longer records deferred revenue write-downs associated with acquired businesses. With respect to periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2023, the Company has included an adjustment in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of deferred revenue write-downs associated with the Pre-2022 Acquisitions consistent with this prior accounting standard, given the ongoing impact of such deferred revenue on the Company's financial results under GAAP over this time period. With respect to periods beginning on and after January 1, 2024, the Company no longer recognizes any deferred revenue write-downs associated with the Pre-2022 Acquisitions under GAAP, and accordingly such deferred revenue write-downs are not an adjustment in connection with the calculation of adjusted EBITDA for periods on and after January 1, 2024. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is susceptible to varying calculations. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and has limitations as an analytical tool. 
 
 A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, is set forth below (in thousands).

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 3.7 million to 46.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 50.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a 3.6 million increase in income tax payments, while cash receipts increased modestly compared to the prior year. Our days sales outstanding DSO was 37 days for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 43 days for the third quarter of 2023. The Company calculates DSO by dividing the average accounts receivable balance for the quarter by average daily revenues for the quarter. The Company s primary sources of cash were receipts generated from the sales of our products and services. The primary uses of cash to fund operations included personnel expenses, sales commissions, royalty payments, payments for contract labor and other direct expenses associated with delivery of our products and services, income tax payments, and general corporate expenses. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 25.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 47.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invested in marketable securities of 51.5 million, made payments for capitalized software development of 20.1 million, and purchased property and equipment of 1.2 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by 46.2 million in maturities of marketable securities and 0.8 million received upon the settlement and release of escrowed proceeds related to a prior sale of a non-marketable equity investment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company spent 6.6 million for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Electronic Education Documentation System, LLC eeds (note: the eeds acquisition was consummated on December 31, 2022, but was funded in January 2023 such that the purchase price for eeds impacted net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023), invested in marketable securities of 38.2 million, made payments for capitalized software development of 19.6 million, and purchased property and equipment of 1.9 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by 19.0 million in maturities of marketable securities and 45,000 in proceeds from the sales of non-marketable equity investments. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 2.6 million for the payment of cash dividends and 0.9 million for the payment of employee payroll taxes in relation to the vesting of restricted share units. The uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 2.3 million for the payment of cash dividends, 1.6 million for repurchases of common stock (note: share repurchases totaled 2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with 1.6 million paid in cash and 0.5 million included in accrued expenses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023), and 0.8 million for the payment of employee payroll taxes in relation to the vesting of restricted share units. 
 
 Our balance sheet reflects working capital of 35.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital is primarily a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The Company s primary source of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was 57.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 37.4 million of marketable securities. 
 
 The Company also has a 50.0 million revolving credit facility. There currently are no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility expires on October 6, 2026, unless earlier renewed or amended. For additional information regarding our revolving credit facility, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 
 
 On September 13, 2023, the Company announced a share repurchase program approved by the Company's Board under which the Company was authorized to purchase up to 10.0 million of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program expired according to its terms on March 31, 2024, and no repurchases occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024. During the term of this program, the Company repurchased a total of 404,188 shares under this program at an aggregate fair value of 8.9 million, based on an average price per share of 22.07 (excluding the cost of broker commissions). We may elect in the future to adopt a new share repurchase program. 

On February 20, 2023, we announced that our Board approved a quarterly dividend policy. Under this dividend policy, our Board declared, and the Company paid, quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate of 0.025 per share during the year ended December 31, 2023. On February 19, 2024, our Board approved a quarterly dividend under this dividend policy at a rate of 0.028 per share, which was paid on March 22, 2024 to the holders of record of our common stock on March 11, 2024. On April 22, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.028 per share, which was paid on May 17, 2024 to holders of record of our common stock on May 6, 2024. On July 22, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.028 per share, which was paid on August 16, 2024 to holders of record of our common stock on August 5, 2024. On October 21, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.028 per share, which will be payable on November 15, 2024 to holders of record of our common stock on November 4, 2024.

T he dividend policy and the declaration and payment of each quarterly cash dividend will be subject to our Board s continuing determination that the policy and the declaration and payment of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with applicable law and our credit agreement. Our Board retains the power to modify, suspend, or cancel the dividend policy and quarterly dividends thereunder in any manner and at any time that our Board may deem necessary or appropriate.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash generated from operations, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs, new product development, dividend payments, any repurchases of shares we may elect to make under any future share repurchase program, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.

In addition, the Company s growth strategy includes acquiring businesses or making strategic investments in businesses that complement or enhance our business. It is anticipated that future acquisitions or strategic investments, if any, would be effected through cash consideration, stock consideration, or a combination of both. The issuance of our stock as consideration for an acquisition or to raise additional capital could have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and could adversely affect our stock price. Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and availability calculations designed to set a maximum leverage ratio of outstanding debt to adjusted EBITDA and an interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense. Therefore, the maximum borrowings against our new revolving credit facility would be dependent on the covenant calculations at the time of borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facility. There can be no assurance that amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to consummate any possible acquisitions, and we cannot provide assurance that if we need additional financing that it will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency risk, and investment risk. We do not have any commodity price risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and during the three months then ended, the Company had no outstanding debt. We may become subject to interest rate market risk associated with any future borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The interest rate under the revolving credit facility varies depending on the interest rate option selected by the Company plus a margin determined in accordance with a pricing grid. We are also exposed to market risk with respect to our cash and investment balances, which were 94.9 million at September 30, 2024. Assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates for invested balances, interest income from cash and investments would decrease on an annualized basis by 0.4 million. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, including Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Australian dollar. Increases or decreases in our foreign-denominated revenue from movements in foreign exchange rates are often partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-denominated operating expenses. 
 
 To the extent that our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to assess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening US dollar can increase the costs of our international operations. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts although we may do so in the future. 
 
 Investment Risk 
 
 The Company s investment policy and strategy is focused on investing in highly rated securities with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company s policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer and sets limits on the average portfolio maturity. 
 
 We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held companies, which primarily include early-stage companies. We primarily invest in healthcare technology companies that we believe can help expand our ecosystem. We may continue to make these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive. We may experience additional volatility to our Consolidated Financial Statements due to changes in market prices, observable price changes, and impairments to our strategic investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. 
 
 The above market risk discussion and the estimated amounts presented are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions. Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of actual developments in the market.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Controls and Procedures 
 
 HealthStream s chief executive officer and principal financial officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that HealthStream s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and the information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act was accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its chief executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in HealthStream s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, HealthStream s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 None. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company did not have any share repurchase program in effect and did not purchase any shares of common stock of the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 None. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement, or any non-Rule 10b - 5 trading arrangement, as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
