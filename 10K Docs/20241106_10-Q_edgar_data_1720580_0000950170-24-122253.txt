Summary of the Material Risks Associated with Our Business 
 
 We have a limited operating history and face significant challenges and expenses as we build our capabilities. 

Our business is highly dependent on the success of ADI-001 and ADI-270. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for ADI-001 or ADI-270 in one or more indications and effectively commercialize these product candidates for the treatment of patients in indications for which we receive approval (if any), our business would be significantly harmed. 

Our gamma delta T cell candidates represent a novel approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer indications that creates significant challenges for us. 

Our product candidates are based on novel technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the likely success of such product candidates and the time and cost of product candidate development and obtaining regulatory approval. 

Our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization. 

We may not be able to file Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to commence additional clinical trials on the timelines we expect, and even if we are able to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may not permit us to proceed. 

We may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or may not be able to conduct our trials on the timelines we expect. 

The market opportunities for our product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small. 

Although we have commenced manufacturing operations at our manufacturing facility, we currently depend on the ability of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers with whom we contract to perform adequately, particularly with respect to the timely production and delivery of our product candidates, including ADI-001. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 

We are highly dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. 

We will need substantial additional financing to develop our product candidates and implement our operating plans. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

The pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated and such regulations, including the Foreign Investment Law and the negative list, are subject to change which may affect development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. 

The uncertainties in the People s Republic of China s legal system regarding the Foreign Investment Law may subject our contractual arrangements to different interpretations or enforcement challenges, or subject us to severe penalties or force us to relinquish our interests in our operations. 

Business disruptions, including armed conflicts, could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. 

A variety of risks associated with conducting research and clinical trials abroad and marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business. 

Global conflicts may increase the likelihood of supply interruptions which could impact our ability to find the materials we need to make our product candidates. 

Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and negatively impact the value of our common stock. 

1 

If our collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) is terminated, or if Regeneron materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed. 

The FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates. 

If our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market. 

We depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business. 

The trading price of our common stock is highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock. Securities class action or other litigation involving our company or members of our management team could also substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.

ADICET BIO, INC. 
 Notes to Interim Consolidat ed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has historically financed its operations primarily through a collaboration and licensing arrangement, public and private placements of equity securities and debt, and cash received in the Merger with resTORbio. To date, none of the Company s product candidates have been approved for sale and therefore the Company has not generated any revenue from product sales. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future, until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of its product candidates currently in development. On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Capital On Demand Sales Agreement (the JonesTrading Sales Agreement) with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, as sales agent, to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate amount of million of shares of common stock from time to time in at-the-market (ATM) offerings. In August 2022, pursuant to the JonesTrading Sales Agreement and subject to the limitations thereof, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of common stock at per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of million after deducting sales agent commissions and expenses. In November 2022, the Company filed a new prospectus supplement to the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement for the offer and sale of up to million of shares of common stock from time to time through the sales agent, which includes the million of shares of common stock not sold under the original prospectus and up to an additional million of shares of common stock (the JonesTrading ATM Program). In January 2024, the Company raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million through the JonesTrading ATM Program. In March 2024, the Company terminated the JonesTrading ATM Program. On January 22, 2024, Adicet entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (Jefferies) and Guggenheim Securities, LLC (the Underwriters) related to an underwritten public offering (the Offering) of shares (the Shares) of common stock of the Company, par value per share (the Common Stock), and, in lieu of Common Stock to an investor, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants) to purchase shares of Common Stock (the Warrant Shares). The Shares were sold at a public offering price of per share and the Pre-Funded Warrants were sold at a public offering price of per underlying share, which represents the per share public offering price of each share of common stock minus the per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. The purchase price paid by the Underwriters to the Company was per Share and per Pre-Funded Warrant, representing a discount to the Underwriters of . In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters an option exercisable for days 

 10 

shares of Common Stock. On January 23, 2024, the Underwriters exercised this option in full. The Company received net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and other estimated offering expenses, of approximately million. The Company may receive nominal proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants. In March 2024, the Company entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement SM (the Jefferies Sales Agreement) with Jefferies to sell shares of its Common Stock from time to time, through an ATM equity offering program under which Jefferies will act as sales agent or principal. As of September 30, 2024, no shares of common stock have been sold under the Jefferies Sales Agreement. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities, including the proceeds raised through the JonesTrading ATM Program and the Offering, will be sufficient to fund its forecasted operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. All of the Company s revenue to date has been generated from a collaboration and license agreement (the Regeneron Agreement) with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc, (Regeneron). The Company does not expect to generate any significant product revenue until it obtains regulatory approval of and commercializes any of the Company s product candidates or enters into additional collaborative agreements with third parties, and it does not know when, or if, either will occur. The Company expects to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and it expects the losses to increase as the Company continues the development of, and seeks regulatory approvals for, its product candidates and begins to commercialize any approved products. The Company is subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, including, but not limited to, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, risk of failure in preclinical and clinical studies, safety and efficacy of its product candidates in clinical trials, the risk of relying on external parties such as contract research organizations (CROs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), the regulatory approval process, market acceptance of the Company s products once approved, lack of marketing and sales history, dependence on key personnel and protection of proprietary technology and it may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect its business. Until such time as the Company can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, the Company expects to finance its operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate or other sources of financing. Adequate funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. The Company s failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and the Company s ability to pursue its business strategies. Although the Company continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all.

On March 13, 2023, the Company and Banc of California executed a letter agreeing that, notwithstanding the covenants included in the 2022 Loan Amendment, until June 30, 2023 (i) the Company and its subsidiaries will not be required to maintain the lesser of million or seventy percent (70 of its combined balances in demand deposit accounts, money market funds and/or insured cash sweep (ICS) accounts with Banc of California and (ii) the Company must maintain its combined balances at Banc of California or its affiliates, including Pacific Western Asset Management (the Letter). On May 30, 2023, the Company further amended its Loan Agreement with Banc of California (the 2023 Loan Amendment). Pursuant to the 2023 Loan Amendment, the Company must maintain the lesser of (i) million or (ii) all of the Company s combined balances in demand deposit accounts, money market accounts, and/or insured cash sweep accounts with Banc of California. If the Company s total cash and investments drop to less than million, the 2023 Loan Amendment permits the Company to maintain cash and/or investments in one or more accounts outside of Banc of California up to a total of million. In April 2024, the Term Loan availability under the Loan Agreement expired. The Non-Formula Ancillary Services, which shall not exceed million in the aggregate, remain available under the Loan Agreement as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had million available under the Loan Agreement. Additionally, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company was in compliance with such covenants as stated in the 2023 Loan Amendment and had no indebtedness outstanding under the Loan Agreement. 

 million from Regeneron upon execution of the Regeneron Agreement and an aggregate of million of additional payments for research funding from 

 15 

million of option exercise fees, as specified in the Regeneron Agreement. Per the terms of the agreement, Regeneron must pay the Company high single digit royalties as a percentage of net sales for immune cell products (ICPs) to targets for which it has exclusive rights, and low single digit royalties as a percentage of net sales on any non-ICP product comprising a targeting moiety generated by the Company through the use of Regeneron s proprietary mice. The Company must pay Regeneron mid-single to low double digit, but less than teens, of royalties as a percentage of net sales of ICPs to targets for which the Company has exercised exclusive rights, and low to mid-single digit of royalties as a percentage of net sales of targeting moieties generated from the Company s license to use Regeneron s proprietary mice. Royalties are payable until the longer of the expiration or invalidity of the licensed patent rights or from first commercial sale. No royalties have been earned or paid under the Regeneron Agreement through September 30, 2024. On January 28, 2022, Regeneron exercised its option to license the exclusive, worldwide rights to ADI-002, an allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy directed against Glypican-3, pursuant to the Regeneron Agreement. In conjunction with the exercise of the option, Regeneron paid an exercise fee of million to the Company on January 28, 2022, and the Company completed the transfer of the associated license rights to Regeneron during the first quarter of 2022. The million option exercise fee, plus million of revenue recognized relating to the combined performance obligation, resulted in an aggregate of million recorded as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company's obligations under the combined performance obligation were completed during the year ended December 31, 2022. Regeneron is responsible, at its sole cost, for all development, manufacturing and commercialization of ADI-002 and must pay the Company high single digit royalties as a percentage of any net sales of ADI-002 for a period commencing on the first commercial sale until the longer of (i) the expiration or invalidity of the licensed patent rights or (ii) a low double digit amount of years from first commercial sale. Twist Bioscience In March 2021, the Company entered into an Antibody Discovery Agreement (the Twist Agreement) with Twist Bioscience Corporation (Twist). Under the terms of the Twist Agreement, Twist will utilize its proprietary platform technology to assist the Company with the discovery of novel antibodies related to target antigens selected by the Company. The Company maintains the sole and exclusive rights to any program antibodies discovered under the Twist Agreement and has the right to patent, assign, license or transfer any work product under the agreement. Furthermore, the Company has the right to sublicense its rights to program antibodies to third parties. The Company may terminate the Twist Agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon a specified period advance written notice. Per the terms of the agreement, the Company will pay Twist an upfront, non-refundable project initiation fee, a technology access fee, as well as a project fee for each project entered into under the agreement. Additionally, the Company will pay fees for development and regulatory milestones in the tens of millions of dollars and low single digit royalties on net sales to Twist for programs initiated under the agreement. In November 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Twist Agreement (the Twist Amendment). The Twist Amendment updates the language associated with Twist's audit rights as well as the amounts associated with technology access fees. On a cumulative basis as of September 30, 2024 , the Company has incurred and expensed million related to project initiation fees, technology access fees and projects fees as research and development expense related to this agreement. 

16 

million. The Company fully utilized the allowance for the continued buildout of office and laboratory space at 1000 Bridge Parkway in 2023. Per the terms of this amendment, this additional allowance will be repaid through equal monthly payments of principal amortization and interest on a monthly basis over the term of the lease at an interest rate of eight percent per annum. The Company received the allowance on February 21, 2023 and increased the operating lease liability accordingly. On August 7, 2023, Adicet Therapeutics entered into a fourth lease amendment with Westport Office Park, LLC (the Fourth Amendment). The Fourth Amendment amends the period over which the tenant improvement allowance received in the Third Amendment will be amortized and identifies the monthly amortization payable by the Company. On September 1, 2023, Adicet Therapeutics amended its letter of credit with Westport Office Park, LLC. The amendment reduced the amount of the letter of credit associated with 1000 Bridge Parkway by million resulting in an updated letter of credit amount of 2.1 million. Boston In 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement, as amended in 2019, for office space at 500 Boylston St, Boston, Massachusetts (500 Boylston Lease). Under the terms of the 500 Boylston Lease, the Company was permitted to assign, sublease or transfer this lease, with the consent of the landlord. On July 19, 2021, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with RFS OPCO LLC (Sublessee), whereby the Company agreed to sublease to Sublessee all of the rentable square feet of 500 Boylston St. The expected undiscounted cash flows to be received from the sublease as of September 30, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):

The repriced options otherwise retained their existing terms and conditions as set forth in the Plans and applicable award agreements. The stock option modification resulted in million of incremental compensation cost, which was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Of the incremental compensation cost, million and million was recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to million recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, million will be recognized on the straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period of the repriced options. The incremental cost is included in general and administrative expense and research and development expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Effective August 21, 2024, the board of directors approved a rescission of the Option Repricing for certain non-employee directors of the Company. All of the affected stock options have been reverted to their original exercise price as established at the time of the grant. The Company will continue to recognize the incremental fair value from the Option Repricing for the impacted options. The compensation expense associated with the Option Repricing for these options was not material.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as supplemented by our subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer. We are advancing a pipeline of off-the-shelf gamma delta T cells, engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), to facilitate durable activity in patients. 
 Our approach to activate, engineer and manufacture allogeneic gamma delta T cell product candidates derived from the peripheral blood cells of unrelated donors allows us to generate new product candidates in a rapid and cost-efficient manner. Our allogeneic "off-the-shelf" manufacturing process is designed to allow product from unrelated donors to be stored and sold on demand to treat patients without inducing a graft versus host immune response. This is in contrast to products based on alpha beta T cells, which either must be manufactured for each patient from his or her own T cells, or require significant gene editing to manufacture if the T cells are derived from donors that are unrelated to the patient. 
 Our lead product candidate, ADI-001, a first-in-class allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapy expressing a CAR targeting CD20, is being developed for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases. We are also pursuing ADI-270, an armored gamma delta CAR T cell product candidate designed to address multiple CD70+ solid tumor and hematological malignancies indications, with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as the initial indication. Our pipeline has several additional internal gamma delta T cell therapy programs in discovery and preclinical development for both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. We expect to continue to develop product candidates in autoimmune diseases and cancer based on our gamma delta T cell platform using either previously validated antigens or those that we identify and target using CAR and other technology. We plan to file one new Investigational New Drug (IND) application every 12-18 months. 
 ADI-001 
 In December 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our IND applications for ADI-001 in lupus nephritis (LN) and in August 2024, we expanded our ADI-001 autoimmune clinical development program to include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis (AAV). In September 2024, we activated sites for our Phase 1 clinical trial of ADI-001 in autoimmune diseases and opened enrollment for patients with LN. In October 2024, we received clearance for our IND amendment to evaluate ADI-001 in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and stiff person syndrome (SPS) as part of our Phase 1 clinical trial in autoimmune diseases. We expect to initiate enrollment for patients with SLE, SSc, IIM and SPS in the first quarter of 2025, and for patients with AAV in the second half of 2025. We believe the favorable safety profile, cellular kinetics and B cell depletion in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid tissue demonstrated with ADI-001 clinical experience to date is favorable for development in autoimmune diseases. We believe the potential market opportunity for ADI-001 in B cell mediated autoimmune diseases is substantial based on the prevalence in the U.S., EU5, China and Japan of greater than 1.7 million patients with autoimmune diseases where CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept, including SLE (which includes LN), SSc, IIM and SPS. In June 2024, the FDA granted us Fast Track Designation to ADI-001 for the potential treatment of relapsed/refractory class III or class IV LN. We plan to report preliminary clinical data from our Phase 1 clinical study of ADI-001 in LN in the first half of 2025, and for other autoimmune diseases in the second half of 2025, subject to study site initiation and patient enrollment. 
 Due to the prioritization of ADI-001 in autoimmune indications, patient enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical study of ADI-001 in mantle cell lymphoma has been closed. 
 ADI-270 
 22 

ADI-270 is an investigational allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting CD70 via the CD27-ligand for the treatment of RCC and with potential in other solid tumor indications. ADI-270 is designed to home to solid tumors, with a highly specific targeting moiety for CD70 and an armoring technology of transforming growth factor beta dominant-negative receptor to address immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. Building on gamma delta 1 tissue tropism to solid tumors and three mechanisms of anti-tumor activity (CAR, innate and adaptive), CAR gamma delta 1 T cells may be well positioned to address solid tumors. 
 In June 2024, we received FDA clearance for our IND application for ADI-270 in RCC. In July 2024, we also received FDA Fast Track Designation for ADI-270 for the potential treatment of patients with metastatic/advanced clear cell RCC. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 multicenter, open-label clinical trial to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of ADI-270 in RCC patients in the fourth quarter of 2024 and share preliminary clinical data in the first half of 2025, subject to site initiation and patient enrollment. 
 Recent Developments 
 Research and Development Activities in China 
 In May 2024, we initiated research and development activities in China through a series of contractual agreements entered into and among Shanghai Adicet Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (the Adicet VIE), Adicet (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Adicet Shanghai), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adicet Therapeutics, Inc. (Adicet Therapeutics), and the shareholders of the Adicet VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of the Adicet VIE, which is considered a consolidated entity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). 
 At-the-Market (ATM) Offering 
 On March 22, 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement SM (the Jefferies Sales Agreement) with Jefferies to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, through an ATM equity offering program under which Jefferies will act as sales agent or principal (the Jefferies ATM Program). As of September 30, 2024, no shares of common stock have been sold under the Jefferies Sales Agreement. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue 
 We have no products approved for commercial sale and do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, which we expect will not be for at least several years, if ever. 
 Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses, which consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of: 
 employee related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for research and development employees; 

costs incurred under agreements with consultants, contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and contract research organizations (CROs); 

lab materials, supplies and maintenance of equipment used for research and development activities; and 

allocated facility-related costs, such as rent, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, information technology costs and general support services. 

We do not allocate our costs by product candidate, as a significant amount of research and development expenses are not tracked by product candidate, and we believe the allocation of such costs would be arbitrary and would not provide a meaningful assessment as we have used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple product candidate research and development programs. 
 23 

We are focusing substantially all of our resources on the development of our product candidates. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including: 
 the scope, rate of progress and expense of clinical trials and other research and development activities; 

clinical trial results; 

uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate or design; 

significant and changing government regulation; 

the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals; 

the FDA s or other regulatory authority s influence on clinical trial design; 

establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for product candidates; 

continued applicable safety profiles of the products following approval; and 

retention of key research and development personnel. 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will continue to require additional capital to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. 
 Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials or we may also be required to sell or license to other rights to our product candidates in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. If we are required to enter into collaborations and other arrangements to supplement our funds, we may have to give up certain rights that limit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or may have other terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders, which could materially affect our business and financial condition. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist principally of payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries and bonuses, benefits and stock based compensation expenses, professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and tax services, allocated overhead expenses, including rent, equipment, depreciation, information technology costs and utilities, and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses. 
 We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future due to expenses related to operating as a public company, including expenses related to personnel costs, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services costs associated with complying with the applicable Nasdaq and SEC requirements, investor relations costs and director and officer insurance premiums. 
 24 

Interest Income 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of the non-cash amortization of costs incurred in connection with the Loan Agreement (as defined in our Liquidity and Capital Resources section below). 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net primarily consists of state franchise and capital taxes not related to income.

General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a 0.3 million increase in payroll and personnel expenses which includes a 0.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, 0.1 million increase in salaries and benefits, and 0.1 million in recruiting and consulting fees. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased by 0.2 million, or 8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, which was primarily due to lower interest rates for the period. 
 Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net decreased by less than 0.1 million, or 62 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This was due to a decrease in franchise taxes and realized losses related to foreign exchange rates.

 Research and development expenses decreased by 5.2 million, or 7 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a 6.4 million decrease in expenses related to CDMOs and other externally conducted research and development. This decrease was partially offset by a 0.9 million increase in laboratory expenses and 0.3 million increase in professional fees. 
 26 

General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.1 million, or 6 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of 1.4 million as well as an increase in legal and other professional fees of 0.4 million. The increase was partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in recruiting fees and other payroll expenses. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income increased by 0.4 million, or 6 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, which was primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates for the first six months of the period as well as our investments in treasury securities. 
 Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net decreased by 0.3 million, or 65 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This was due to a decrease in franchise taxes and realized losses related to foreign exchange rates. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have historically funded our operations primarily through a collaboration and licensing arrangement, public and private placements of equity securities and debt, and cash received in our merger with resTORbio, Inc. 
 In January 2024, we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately 19.3 million through the JonesTrading ATM Program. In March 2024, we terminated the JonesTrading ATM Program and entered into the Jefferies ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, no shares of common stock have been sold through the Jefferies ATM Program. 
 On January 22, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (Jefferies) and Guggenheim Securities, LLC, as representatives of the underwriters (the Underwriters), related to an underwritten public offering (the Offering) of 32,379,667 shares of our common stock, which included 5,325,000 shares sold and issued upon the exercise in full by the Underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 8,445,333 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of 2.40 per share and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a public offering price of 2.3999 per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share public offering price of each share of common stock minus the 0.0001 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. The purchase price paid by the Underwriters to us was 2.256 per share and 2.2559 per pre-funded warrant, representing a discount to the Underwriters of 6.0 . We received net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and other estimated offering expenses, of approximately 91.7 million. We may receive nominal proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the pre-funded warrants. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities of 202.1 million. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities will be sufficient to fund our forecasted operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Loan Agreement 
 On April 28, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Banc of California (formerly known as Pacific Western Bank) to finance leasehold improvements for our facilities in Redwood City, CA and other purposes permitted under the Loan Agreement. On October 21, 2021, we amended the Loan Agreement (as amended, the 2021 Loan Amendment) under which Banc of California will provide one or more Term Loans (as defined in the 2021 Loan Amendment), as well as certain Non-Formula Ancillary Services which shall not exceed 5.5 million in the aggregate. Non-Formula Ancillary Services are defined as automated clearinghouse transactions, corporate credit card services, letters of credit, or other treasury management services. Per the terms of the Loan Agreement, the aggregate sum of the outstanding Term Loans and Non-Formula Ancillary Services shall at no time exceed 15.0 million, which each Term Loan to be in an amount of not less than 1.0 million. Pursuant to the 2021 Loan Amendment, the interest rate for the Term Loans shall be set at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 0.25 above the Prime Rate then in effect and (ii) 4.25 . 
 27 

On December 2, 2022, we further amended the Loan Agreement (the 2022 Loan Amendment). The 2022 Loan Amendment extended the drawdown period for any Term Loan by one year, which expired on April 19, 2024. Furthermore, the 2022 Loan Amendment extended the final maturity date of any Term Loan by one year from October 19, 2025 to October 19, 2026, and the maturity date of non-formula ancillary services to November 30, 2023. 
 On May 30, 2023, we entered into the 2023 Loan Amendment. Pursuant to the 2023 Loan Amendment, we must maintain the lesser of (i) 35.0 million or (ii) all of our combined balances in demand deposit accounts, money market accounts, and/or insured cash sweep accounts with Banc of California. If our total cash and investments drop to less than 35.0 million, the 2023 Loan Amendment permits us to maintain cash and/or investments in one or more accounts outside of Banc of California up to a total of 2.5 million. 
 In April 2024, the Term Loan availability under our Loan Agreement expired. The Non-Formula Ancillary Services, which shall not exceed 5.5 million in the aggregate, remain available. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we were in compliance with such covenants and had no indebtedness outstanding under the Loan Agreement. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We recorded net loss of 30.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Prior to this period, we have recorded net losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 469.2 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities of 202.1 million. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities will be sufficient for us to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the issuance date of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. 
 All of our revenue to date has been generated from our License and Collaboration Agreement (the Regeneron Agreement) with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron). We do not expect to generate any significant product revenue until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates or enter into additional collaborative agreements with third parties, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. 
 We will continue to require additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. We may seek to raise capital through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, the requirements for which will depend on many factors, including: 
 the scope, timing, rate of progress and costs of our drug discovery efforts, preclinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the timing, number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

the cost, timing and outcome of preparing for and undergoing regulatory review of our product candidates; 

the scope and costs of development and commercial manufacturing activities; 

the cost and timing associated with commercializing our product candidates, if they receive marketing approval; 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

28 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of our product candidates and, ultimately, the sale of our products, following FDA approval; 

our implementation of operational, financial and management systems; 

the impact of potential health emergencies, like the COVID-19 pandemic, on United States and global economic conditions that may impact our ability to access capital on terms anticipated, or at all; and 

the post-merger costs associated with being a public company. 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will continue to require additional capital to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials or we may also be required to sell or license to other rights to our product candidates in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. If we are required to enter into collaborations and other arrangements to supplement our funds, we may have to give up certain rights that limit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or may have other terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders, which could materially affect our business and financial condition. 
 See the section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q titled Risk Factors for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 68.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss offset by non-cash adjustments of 26.2 million, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of 5.5 million. Non-cash items primarily included depreciation and amortization of 4.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of 18.5 million, non-cash lease expense of 2.4 million and a net amortization of premiums and accretion discounts on investments of 0.5 million. The net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a net decrease in accrued and other current and non-current liabilities of 1.2 million and a decrease in operating lease liability of 2.7 million. There was also a 1.7 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a 0.2 million decrease in accounts payable. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 70.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss offset by non-cash adjustments of 41.3 million, and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of 1.6 million. Non-cash items primarily included goodwill impairment of 19.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of 15.3 million, depreciation and amortization of 4.4 million and non-cash lease expense of 2.0 million. The net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in operating lease liability of 0.8 million related to the additional tenant improvement allowance as part of the Third Amendment to the lease at 1000 Bridge Parkway as well as an increase of 0.8 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and an increase of 0.3 million in other non-current assets. This increase was offset by a decrease in accounts payable of 0.2 million. 
 29 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 97.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of 96.6 million of purchases of short-term treasury securities and 0.9 million of purchases of lab equipment for our GMP cell processing suite at 1000 Bridge Parkway. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of purchases of lab equipment primarily related to our GMP cell processing suite at 1000 Bridge Parkway. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 111.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included approximately 91.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and pre-funded warrants in the Offering and approximately 19.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under the JonesTrading ATM Program. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily related to 0.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock with our employee stock purchase plan. This was partially offset by less than 0.1 million of cash paid for taxes withheld on the net share settlement of equity awards. 
 Leases 
 We currently lease an office space in Boston, Massachusetts under a non-cancellable operating lease (the Boston Lease), with an expiration date of July 31, 2026. The Boston Lease was amended on April 1, 2019, to relocate into a premises in the same building with additional space. The initial annual base rent for this lease was 0.6 million and increases 2 annually. On July 19, 2021, we entered into a sublease agreement with the office space in Boston, Massachusetts (the Sublease Agreement). The term of the Sublease Agreement started on September 1, 2021 and will end on July 30, 2026. The aggregate base rent due to us under the Sublease Agreement is approximately 3.5 million. Pursuant to the Sublease Agreement, we agreed to transfer certain furniture located in the subleased premises to the sublessee for 1.00. We remain liable for the lease payments under the Boston Lease. 
 On October 28, 2018, Adicet Therapeutics executed a non-cancelable lease agreement for an office and laboratory facility at 1000 Bridge Parkway (the Redwood City Lease), with an expiration date of February 28, 2030. The initial annual base rent for the Redwood City Lease is an aggregate of 1.3 million, and such amount will increase 3 annually. On June 16, 2022, Adicet Therapeutics entered into a second amendment to the Redwood City Lease (the Second Amendment), which expands the space lease by 12,204 square feet (the Expansion Space). Adicet Therapeutics will pay a monthly fee for the Expansion Space increasing annually from approximately 73,000 to 78,000 over the thirty-six (36) month term of the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment also provides Adicet Therapeutics with an allowance to construct improvements to the Expansion Space. On January 9, 2023, Adicet Therapeutics entered into a third amendment of the Redwood City Lease (the Third Amendment). The Third Amendment increases the tenant improvement allowance as of January 1, 2023 by an additional 3.0 million. The additional allowance will be repaid through equal monthly payments of principal amortization and interest on a monthly basis over the term of the lease at an interest rate of eight percent (8 per annum. On August 7, 2023, Adicet Therapeutics entered into the Fourth Amendment, which amends the period over which the tenant improvement allowance received in the Third Amendment will be amortized and identifies the monthly amortization payable by us. 
 On January 19, 2024, we entered into a membership agreement with Industrious Bos 131 Dartmouth Street LLC for office space at 131 Dartmouth Street, Boston, Massachusetts (the Dartmouth Street Agreement). The Dartmouth Street Agreement commenced on February 1, 2024 and expires on January 31, 2025. On March 12, 2024, we amended the Dartmouth Street Agreement to include additional office space which commenced on May 1, 2024 and expires April 30, 2025. On March 12, 2024, we further amended the Dartmouth Street Agreement to include additional office space which commenced on June 1, 2024 and expires May 31, 2025. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported 
 30 

amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions, including those related to accruals for CDMO, CRO and research and development expenses, and equity-based compensation are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. These critical estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 19, 2024. 
 Smaller Reporting Company 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. These provisions include (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; (ii) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (iii) the option to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. 
 We will continue to be a smaller reporting company for as long as we continue to have (i) less than 250 million in market value of our shares held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) less than 100 million of annual revenues in our most recent fiscal year completed before the last business day of our second fiscal quarter and a market value of our shares held by non-affiliates of less than 700 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
 We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. We have elected to avail ourselves of the exemption for the delayed adoption of certain accounting standards and, therefore, are not subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 See the section titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities of 202.1 million, which consisted of cash and funds invested in treasury securities and money market funds. Interest income is sensitive to general level of interest rates; however, due to the nature of these investments, an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities, financial position, or results of operations. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our headquarters are located in the United States, where a majority of our general and administrative expenses and research and development costs are incurred in U.S. Dollars. As we grow our business, our results of operations and cash flows may be subject to fluctuations due to foreign currency exchange rates. To date, we do not believe foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have had a significant impact on our results of operations for any periods presented herein. 
 
 Inflation Risk 
 Our assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, furniture, fixtures and office equipment, computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. Inflation 
 31 

generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, clinical trial and manufacturing costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 32 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1.	Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, as of September 30, 2024, we were not party to any legal proceedings that we would expect to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. 
 Item 1A.	Ris k Factors. 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other documents that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in evaluating us and our business. If any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks facing us. New risk factors can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any factor or combination of factors may have on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The risk factors denoted with a " ", if any, are newly added or have been materially updated from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Risks Related to Operating History 
 We have a limited operating history and face significant challenges and expenses as we build our capabilities. 
 Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We began operations in November 2014. We have a limited operating history upon which someone can evaluate our business and prospects and is subject to the risks inherent in any early stage company, including, among other things, risks that we may not be able to hire sufficient qualified personnel and establish operating controls and procedures. We currently do not have complete in-house resources to enable our gamma delta T cell platform. As we build our own capabilities, we expect to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, including the risks and uncertainties described herein. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products. 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur substantial net losses in the future. 
 We are an early clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we will continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred net losses since our inception. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our license and collaboration agreements and the issuance and sale of our capital stock, including most recently: (i) net proceeds of approximately 19.3 million, after deducting sales agent commissions, but before deducting any expenses related to such sales, from sales of our common stock under our at-the-market program in January 2024 and (ii) net proceeds of approximately 91.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and other estimated offering expenses, from the sale of our common stock and pre-funded warrants in an underwritten public offering in January 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net loss of 30.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 469.2 million. 
 We expect to incur significant expenditures for the foreseeable future, and we expect these expenditures to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, product candidates based on our gamma delta T cell platform, including ADI-001 and ADI-270. Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses 
 33 

and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital. Further, even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product candidates or even continue our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and cause investors to lose all or part of their investments. 
 Our history of recurring losses and anticipated expenditures could raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that with 202.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities as of September 30, 2024, we are capitalized into the second half of 2026. Our ability to continue as a going concern beyond this point will require us to obtain additional funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we would be forced to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts of one or more of our product candidates, or may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. In our future required quarterly assessments, we may again conclude that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Risks Related to Our Product Candidates 
 Our business is highly dependent on the success of ADI-001 and ADI-270. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for ADI-001 and ADI-270 in one or more indications and effectively commercialize these product candidates for the treatment of patients in indications for which we receive approval (if any), our business would be significantly harmed. 
 Our business and future success depends on our ability to obtain regulatory approval of, and then successfully commercialize ADI-001, our most advanced product candidate, and ADI-270. We have opened enrollment at multiple clinical sites for patients with lupus nephristis (LN) in our Phase 1 clinical trial of ADI-001 and plan to commence enrollment for patients with lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis (AAV), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and stiff person syndrome (SPS). In addition, we received FDA clearance for our IND application for ADI-270 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in June 2024 and plan to initiate a Phase 1 multicenter, open-label clinical trial to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity for this product candidate. 
 Our preclinical results or clinical results to date may not predict results for our planned or ongoing trials or any future studies of ADI-001, ADI-270 or any other allogeneic gamma delta T cell product candidate. Because of the lack of evaluation of allogeneic products and gamma delta T cell therapy products in the clinic to date, any such product s failure, or the failure of other allogeneic T cell therapies or gamma delta T cell therapies, may significantly influence physicians and regulators opinions in regards to the viability of our entire pipeline of allogeneic T cell therapies, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation. If our gamma delta T cell therapy is viewed as less safe or effective than autologous therapies or other allogeneic T cell therapies, our ability to develop other allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies may be significantly harmed. 
 All of our product candidates, including ADI-001 and ADI-270, will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales. In addition, because ADI-001 is our most advanced product candidate, and because our other product candidates are based on similar technology, if ADI-001 encounters safety or efficacy problems, manufacturing problems, developmental delays, regulatory issues or other problems, our development plans and business would be significantly harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and prospects. 
 Our gamma delta T cell candidates represent a novel approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer indications that creates significant challenges for us. 
 We are developing a pipeline of gamma delta T cell product candidates and a novel antibody platform that are intended for use in patients with certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. Advancing these novel product candidates creates significant challenges for us, including: 
 34 

negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials, preclinical studies or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours, leading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies or abandon a program; 

delays in enrolling or inability to enroll subjects in our clinical trials; 

manufacturing our product candidates to our specifications and in a timely manner to support our current and future clinical trials, and, if approved, commercialization; 

sourcing current and future clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the raw materials used to manufacture our product candidates; 

understanding and addressing variability in the quality of a donor s T cells, which could ultimately affect our ability to produce product in a reliable and consistent manner; 

inability to achieve efficacy in autoimmune disease and cancer patients following treatment with our product candidates; 

achieving a side effect profile from our product candidates in autoimmune diseases and cancer indications that makes them clinically and commercially attractive for further development; 

educating medical personnel regarding the potential side effect profile of our product candidates, if approved; 

using medicines to manage adverse side effects of our product candidates which may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have a detrimental impact on the efficacy of the treatment; 

conditioning patients with chemotherapy or other lymphodepletion agents in advance of administering our product candidates, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects; 

obtaining regulatory approval, as the FDA and other regulatory authorities have limited experience with development of allogeneic T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer; and 

establishing sales and marketing capabilities upon obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance of a novel therapy. 

The success of our business, including our ability to obtain financing and generate any revenue in the future, will primarily depend on the positive efficacy and safety profile and durability of our product candidates in our clinical trials, regulatory approval, successful development and commercialization of our novel product candidates, and our ability to build out our manufacturing capabilities, which may never occur. We have not yet succeeded and may not succeed in demonstrating efficacy and safety or durability for any of our product candidates in clinical trials or in obtaining marketing approval thereafter. Given our early stage of development, it may be several years, if at all, before we have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a product candidate sufficient to warrant approval for commercialization. If we are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, successfully commercialize our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. 
 Our product candidates are based on novel technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the likely success of such product candidates and the time and cost of product candidate development and obtaining regulatory approval. 
 We have concentrated our research and development efforts on our allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapy and our future success depends on the successful development of this therapeutic approach. We are in the early stages of developing our platform and product candidates and there can be no assurance that any development problems we have experienced or may experience in the future will not cause significant delays or result in unforeseen issues or unanticipated costs, or that any such development problems or issues can be overcome. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our future clinical studies or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. In addition, our expectations with regard to the advantages of an allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapy platform relative to other therapies may not materialize or materialize to the degree we anticipate. Further, our scalability and costs of manufacturing may vary significantly as we develop our product candidates and understand these critical factors. 
 In addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate are determined according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval 
 35 

process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more complex and consequently more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Approvals by the EMA and FDA for existing autologous CAR T cell therapies, such as Kymriah and Yescarta , as well as other pathways to approval, may not be indicative of what these regulators may require for approval of our therapies. Also, while we expect reduced variability in our product candidates compared to autologous products, we do not have significant clinical data supporting any benefit of lower variability. More generally, approvals by any regulatory agency may not be indicative of what any other regulatory agency may require for approval or what such regulatory agencies may require for approval in connection with new product candidates. 
 Our product candidates may also not perform successfully in clinical trials or may be associated with adverse events that distinguish them from the autologous CAR T-cell therapies that have previously been approved or alpha beta T cell therapies that may be approved in the future. Unexpected clinical outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt our clinical development, prevent our regulatory approval, limit our commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences. 
 Undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Approved autologous CAR T-cell therapies and those under development have shown frequent rates of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, and adverse events have resulted in the death of patients. Additionally, in November 2023, the FDA announced an investigation into reports of T-cell malignancies in patients who had received B-cell maturation (BCMA)-directed or CD19-directed autologous CAR T cell immunotherapies. In January 2024, the FDA determined that new boxed warning language related to T-cell malignancies should be included in the labeling for all BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies. While we believe our gamma delta T cell approach may lessen such results, similar or other adverse events for our allogeneic gamma delta T cell product candidates may occur and could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception and publicity, potential impacts on enrollment in our clinical trials, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved, and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates . In addition, while we anticipate our focus on gamma delta T cells may lessen the likelihood of graft versus host disease relative to therapies relying on unrelated alpha beta T cells, similar or other adverse events for our allogeneic gamma delta T cell product candidates may occur. 
 If unacceptable toxicities arise in the development of our product candidates, we could suspend or terminate our trials or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease clinical trials or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. A data safety monitoring board may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Novel therapeutic candidates, such as those we are developing, may result in novel side effect profiles that may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff. We anticipate having to train medical personnel using our product candidates to understand the side effect profile of our product candidates for our clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any of our product candidates. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in serious adverse events including patient deaths. Based on available preclinical data and clinical experience with other cell therapy agents, the safety profile of our pipeline product candidates is expected to include cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and possibly additional adverse events. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 In addition to side effects and adverse events caused by any product candidates we may develop, the conditioning, administration process or related procedures that may be used with our product candidates may also cause adverse side effects. A T cell therapy patient is generally administered cytotoxic drugs to remove stem cells from the bone marrow to create sufficient space in the bone marrow for the modified stem cells to engraft and produce new cells. This procedure causes side effects and, among other potential risks, can transiently compromise the patient s immune system, known as neutropenia, and reduce blood clotting, known as thrombocytopenia. If we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by the conditioning regimens used, administration process or related procedure, the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, any product candidates we may develop for any or all target indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that adverse events are not related to our product candidate, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment, the ability of enrolled patients to complete the clinical trial or the commercial viability of any product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. 
 If we are required by the FDA to obtain approval of a companion diagnostic in connection with approval of any of our product candidates, including in connection with our gamma delta T cell therapy targeting CD70, and we do not obtain, or 
 36 

face delays in obtaining, FDA approval of such companion diagnostic, we will not be able to commercialize such product candidate and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. 
 If the FDA believes that the safe and effective use of any of our product candidates depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then it may require approval or clearance of that diagnostic as a companion diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves our product candidates, if at all. According to FDA guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared for that indication. Depending on the data from our clinical trials, we may decide to collaborate with diagnostic companies during our clinical trial enrollment process to help identify patients with characteristics that we believe will be most likely to respond to our product candidates. If a satisfactory companion diagnostic is not commercially available in this situation, we may be required to develop or obtain such test, which would be subject regulatory approval requirements. The process of obtaining or creating such diagnostic is time consuming and costly. 
 Companion diagnostics are developed in conjunction with clinical programs for the associated product and are subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and the FDA has generally required premarket approval of companion diagnostics for cancer therapies. The approval or clearance of a companion diagnostic as part of the therapeutic product s further labeling limits the use of the therapeutic product to only those patients who express the specific characteristic that the companion diagnostic was developed to detect. 
 If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority requires approval or clearance of a companion diagnostic for any of our product candidates, whether before or after the product candidate obtains regulatory approval, we and/or third-party collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval or clearance for these companion diagnostics. Any delay or failure by us or third-party collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval or clearance of a companion diagnostic could delay or prevent approval or continued marketing of the relevant product. We or our collaborators may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process for the companion diagnostic or in transferring that process to commercial partners or negotiating insurance reimbursement plans, all of which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our product candidates, if approved, on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. 
 Risks Related to Clinical Trials 
 Our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization. 
 Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. 
 There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy, insufficient durability of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products. 
 In addition, for the ongoing Phase 1 study of ADI-001 and any future trials that may be completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition. 
 We may not be able to file Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to commence additional clinical trials on the timelines we expect, and even if we are able to, the FDA may not permit us to proceed. 
 In December 2023, the IND for our lead product candidate, ADI-001, to treat patients with LN was cleared by the FDA. In the second quarter of 2024, we received clearance for our IND for ADI-001 to include SLE, SSc and AAV. In October 2024, we received clearance for our IND amendment to evaluate ADI-001 in IIM and SPS as part of the ongoing Phase 1 trial in autoimmune diseases. Our pipeline also includes ADI-270, an armored gamma delta CAR T cell product candidate targeting 
 37 

CD70+ cancers. In June 2024, the IND for ADI-270 in RCC was cleared by the FDA. We also have several additional internal gamma delta T cell therapy programs in preclinical development. We previously announced our plan to file one new IND every 12-18 months. We may not be able to make these filings on the timelines we expect, which may cause delays in commencing additional clinical trials. Even if such regulatory authorities agree with the design and implementation of the clinical trials set forth in an IND application or clinical trial application, we cannot guarantee that such regulatory authorities will not change their requirements in the future. Moreover, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND application for any of our other product candidates will result in the FDA allowing trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in a decision by us, by independent institutional review boards (IRBs) or independent ethics committees, or by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities to suspend or terminate clinical trials. For example, we may experience manufacturing delays or other delays with IND-enabling studies or the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical studies that we did not anticipate. Moreover, we cannot be assured that submission of an IND application will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in a decision by us, by IRBs, or independent ethics committees or by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities to suspend or terminate clinical trials, including as a result of a clinical hold. Additionally, even if such regulatory authorities agree with the design and implementation of the clinical trials set forth in an IND application or clinical trial application, we cannot guarantee that such regulatory authorities will not change their requirements in the future. The inability to initiate clinical trials any of our product candidates on the timeline currently anticipated or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 We may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or may not be able to conduct our trials on the timelines we expect. 
 Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming and subject to uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. Even if these trials begin as planned, issues may arise that could suspend or terminate such clinical trials. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include: 
 inability to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of clinical studies; 

delays in sufficiently developing, characterizing or controlling a manufacturing process suitable for advanced clinical trials; 

delays in developing suitable assays for screening patients for eligibility for trials with respect to certain product candidates; 

delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design; 

obtaining regulatory authorization to begin a trial, if applicable, including regulatory approval of any companion diagnostic, if applicable; 

delays in reaching an agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical study sites; 

delays in obtaining required IRB approval at each clinical study site; 

imposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by regulatory agencies for a number of reasons, including after review of an IND application or amendment, or equivalent application or amendment; as a result of a safety finding that presents unreasonable risk to clinical trial participants; a negative finding from an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites; developments on trials conducted by competitors for related technology that raises FDA concerns about risk to patients of the technology broadly; or if FDA finds that the investigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives; 

delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies; 

difficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators; 

failure by our CROs or other third parties to adhere to clinical study requirements; 

failure to perform in accordance with the FDA s Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) requirements or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries; 

38 

challenges in transferring manufacturing processes to any new contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) or our manufacturing facilities or any other development or commercialization partner for the manufacture of product candidates; 

delays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up; 

developing and implementing processes and procedures with collaborators, if applicable, relating to the collection and transfer of patient samples and the timely performance of a companion diagnostic on such samples; 

patients dropping out of a study; 

occurrence of adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; 

changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols; 

changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials; 

the cost of clinical studies of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate; 

clinical studies of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs; 

delays or failure to secure supply agreements with suitable raw material suppliers, or any failures by suppliers to meet our quantity or quality requirements for necessary raw materials; 

political conditions or conflicts in regions where we conduct or may seek to conduct our clinical trials; and 

manufacturing challenges, including delays in testing, releasing, validating, or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing. 

Our timing of filing INDs for our product candidates is dependent on further preclinical and manufacturing success, which we work on with various third parties. We cannot be sure that we will be able to submit our INDs in a timely manner, if at all, or that submission of an IND application or IND amendment will result in the FDA allowing testing and clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trials. 
 Any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required to or we may elect to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. 
 Monitoring safety of patients receiving our product candidates is challenging, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize. 
 In our current and planned clinical trials of our product candidates, we have contracted with and expect to continue to contract with academic medical centers and hospitals experienced in the assessment and management of toxicities arising during clinical trials. Nonetheless, these centers and hospitals may have difficulty observing patients and treating toxicities, which may be more challenging due to personnel changes, inexperience, shift changes, house staff coverage or related issues. This could lead to more severe or prolonged toxicities or even patient deaths, which could result in us or the FDA delaying, suspending or terminating one or more of our clinical trials, and which could jeopardize regulatory approval. Medicines used at centers to help manage adverse side effects of ADI-001 may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have a detrimental impact on the efficacy of the treatment. Use of these medicines may increase with new physicians and centers administering our product candidates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize on the timelines anticipated or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 39 

If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. 
 We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with the protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until the conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including: 
 the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol; 

the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial s primary endpoints; 

the proximity of patients to study sites; 

the design of the trial; 

our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience; 

our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and 

the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before the infusion of our product candidates or trial completion. 

In addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, some of our clinical trial sites are also being used by some of our competitors, which may reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in that clinical trial site. 
 Moreover, because our product candidates represent unproven methods for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies rather than enroll in our clinical trial. For cancer, they may use chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation or autologous CAR T cell therapies. Patients eligible for allogeneic CAR T cell therapies but ineligible for autologous CAR T cell therapies due to aggressive cancer and inability to wait for autologous CAR T cell therapies may be at greater risk for complications and death from therapy. For autoimmune diseases, potential patients may use therapies that focus on symptomatic relief. 
 Delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our ongoing clinical trial and planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates. 
 Clinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. 
 Human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Because our gamma delta T cell product candidates are based on new technologies and will require the creation of inventory of mass-produced, off-the-shelf products, we expect that we will require extensive research and development and have substantial manufacturing and processing costs. In addition, costs to treat patients with autoimmune diseases and cancer and to treat potential side effects that may result from our product candidates can be significant. Accordingly, our clinical trial costs are likely to be significantly higher than for more conventional therapeutic technologies or drug products, which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position and ability to achieve profitability. 
 As a result, because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. For example, in November 2023, we announced that we paused preclinical development of ADI-925 to prioritize corporate resources on ADI-270. In January 2024, we announced we had deprioritized enrollment of large B cell lymphoma patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial of ADI-001 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in September 2024 we announced a strategic prioritization to focus ADI-001 development resources on autoimmune indications. Due to this prioritization, patient enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical study of ADI-001 in mantle cell lymphoma has been closed. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. Failure to allocate resources or capitalize on strategies in a successful manner will have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 40 

A variety of risks associated with conducting research and clinical trials abroad and marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business. 
 We are currently conducting research and development activities outside of the United States, including in China, and plan to continue to globally develop our product candidates. Accordingly, we expect that our development programs will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including: 
 differing and changing regulatory requirements in foreign countries, including for clinical trial activities and product approvals; 

unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements; 

increased difficulties in managing the logistics and transportation of storing and shipping product candidates produced in the United States and shipping the product candidate to the patient abroad; 

import and export requirements and restrictions; 

economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 

difficulties in compliance with different, complex and changing laws, regulations and court systems of multiple jurisdictions and compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws, treaties and regulations; 

increasing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and other countries in which we may operate and changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic environment especially with respect to a particular country s treatment of or stance towards other countries; 

foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes; 

foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; 

difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations; 

workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; 

differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls; 

potential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or comparable foreign regulations; 

challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; and 

production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad. 

Furthermore, conducting clinical trials in countries outside the United States presents additional risks, including political and economic risks that are not present in the United States, such as armed conflict and economic embargoes or boycotts. We currently conduct and plan in the future to initiate clinical trials of ADI-001 at sites outside of the United States, which may be located in countries involved in or impacted by political unrest and conflicts. For example, while we currently do not expect armed conflicts, such as the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, or related developments to have a significant impact on our ability to obtain results from our clinical trials, further escalation (whether in these countries or surrounding areas) may adversely affect our ability to adequately conduct certain clinical trials and maintain compliance with relevant protocols due to, among other reasons, the prioritization of hospital resources away from clinical trials, reallocation or evacuation of site staff and subjects, or as a result of government-imposed curfews, warfare, violence, or other governmental action or other events that restrict movement. These developments may also result in our inability to access sites for monitoring or to obtain data from affected sites or patients going forward. We could also experience disruptions in our supply chain or limits to our ability to provide sufficient investigational materials in such countries and surrounding regions. Clinical trial sites may suspend or terminate the trials being conducted and patients could be forced to evacuate or choose to relocate, making them unavailable for initial or further participation in such trials. Alternative sites in these areas may not be available and we may need to find other countries to conduct the relevant trials. Furthermore, military action may prevent the FDA or other regulatory agencies from inspecting clinical sites in these countries. Such interruptions may delay our plans for clinical development and approvals for our product candidates. 
 These and other risks associated with our potential international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates and attain or maintain profitable operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Marketing Our Product Candidates 
 41 

The market opportunities for our product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small. 
 The FDA often approves new therapies initially only for use in patients who are currently not adequately treated with currently approved therapies. We expect to initially seek approval of ADI-001 and our other product candidates in this setting. Subsequently, for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval in earlier lines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy. There is no guarantee that our product candidates, even if approved, would be approved for earlier lines of therapy, and, prior to any such approvals, we will have to conduct additional clinical trials, including potentially comparative trials against approved therapies. We are also targeting a similar patient population as autologous CAR T-cell product candidates, including approved autologous CAR T-cell products. Our therapies may not be as safe and effective as autologous CAR T-cell therapies and may only be approved for patients who are ineligible for autologous CAR T-cell therapy. 
 Our projections of both the number of people who have the indications we are targeting, as well as the subset of people with these indications in a position to receive second or later lines of therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these indications. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. Even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications. 
 If we fail to develop additional product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be limited. 
 One of our core strategies is to pursue clinical development of additional product candidates beyond ADI-001. Our pipeline also includes ADI-270, an armored gamma delta CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD70+ cancers, which is in the process of initiating clinical development. In addition, we have several additional internal gamma delta T cell therapy programs in preclinical development. We plan to submit one new IND to the FDA every 12-18 months. Developing, obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing additional gamma delta T cell product candidates will require substantial additional funding and is prone to the risks of failure inherent in medical product development. We cannot provide you any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance any of these additional product candidates through the development process. 
 Even if we receive FDA approval to market our product candidates for the treatment of our targeted indications, we cannot assure you that any such product candidates will be successfully commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace or more effective than other commercially available alternatives. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be limited. Moreover, a failure in obtaining regulatory approval of additional product candidates may have a negative effect on the approval process of any other, or result in losing approval of any approved, product candidate which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. 
 We currently have no marketing and sales organization and as a company have no experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, if approved, we may not be able to generate product revenue. 
 We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and as a company have no experience in marketing products. We may develop a marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel. 
 If we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that it will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product that receives regulatory approval in the United States or overseas. If we are unable to successfully market and distribute our products, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. 
 42 

We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products. 
 Specifically, engineered T cells face significant competition in both the CAR and T cell receptor (TCR) technology space from multiple companies. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, the availability and price of our competitors products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is affected by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances. 
 Risks Related to Manufacturing 
 Although we have commenced manufacturing operations at our manufacturing facility, we currently depend on the ability of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers with whom we contract to perform adequately, particularly with respect to the timely production and delivery of our product candidates, including ADI-001. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 
 Although we commenced manufacturing operations at our Redwood City facility, we rely and expect to continue to rely to a significant extent on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical development. We may not be able to achieve clinical or commercial manufacturing and cell processing on our own or through our CDMOs, including timely supply of off-the-shelf product to satisfy demands to support clinical trials of any of our product candidates. To the extent we are not able to obtain timely supply of off-the-shelf product, the anticipated timing for our clinical trials and the development of our product candidates could be adversely impacted. Very few companies have experience in manufacturing gamma delta T cell therapy derived from blood of unrelated donors, and gamma delta T cells require several complex manufacturing steps before being available as a mass-produced, off-the-shelf product. We have limited experience in managing the allogeneic gamma delta T cell engineering process, and our allogeneic processes may be more difficult or more expensive than the approaches taken by our competitors. We cannot be sure that the manufacturing processes employed by or on our behalf will result in T cells that will be safe and effective. 
 Our operations remain subject to review and oversight by the FDA and the FDA could object to our use of any manufacturing facilities. Even if our product candidates are approved, we would be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and other government regulations. Our license to manufacture product candidates will be subject to continued regulatory review. 
 Our cost of goods development is at an early stage. The actual cost to manufacture and process our product candidates could be greater than we expect and could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our product candidates. 
 The manufacture of biopharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of cell therapy products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling out and validating initial production and ensuring the absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. The occurrence of any of such problems could adversely impact the availability of products for our clinical trials and commercial sale. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We have experienced manufacturing delays due to these issues in the past and cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. 
 43 

Our product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and approved products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. 
 We may fail to manage the logistics of storing and shipping our product candidates. Storage failures and shipment delays and problems caused by us, our vendors or other factors not in our control, such as weather, could result in loss of usable product or prevent or delay the delivery of product candidates to patients. 
 We may also experience both internal and external manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes. We have experienced external manufacturing difficulties in the past; if we were to continue to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients would be jeopardized, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 Risks Related to Our Operations 
 We are highly dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. 
 Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees and other scientific and medical advisors, and our inability to find suitable replacements could result in delays in product development and harm our business. 
 We conduct substantially all of our operations at our facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. This region is headquarters to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for skilled personnel in this market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all. 
 To induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options and restricted stock units that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by fluctuations in our stock price that are beyond our control. Declines in our stock price generally reduce the value of equity awards granted to its employees. To the extent our stock price declines, our ability to incentivize, retain or attract qualified talent could be negatively impacted. Such declines in stock price may result in additional underwater stock options held by certain employees and officers. For example, in August 2024, certain of our executive officers entered into an option cancellation agreement to surrender certain underwater stock options. 
 The value of our stock options may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain key person insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel. To provide added incentives to retain and motivate key contributors, our board of directors approved a stock option repricing in August 2023. Despite this, we may have difficulty retaining key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and further development of our product candidates. See the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Developments Option Repricing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information about the stock option repricing. 
 44 

We will need substantial additional financing to develop our product candidates and implement our operating plans. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 We expect to spend a substantial amount of capital in the clinical development of our product candidates, including the ongoing and future clinical trials for ADI-001, an upcoming clinical trial for ADI-270 in RCC and IND-enabling activities for our additional internal gamma delta T cell therapy programs in preclinical development. We will need substantial additional financing to develop our products and implement our operating plans. In particular, we will require substantial additional financing to enable commercial production of our products and initiate and complete registration trials for multiple products. Further, if approved, we will require significant additional amounts in order to launch and commercialize our product candidates. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that with 202.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities as of September 30, 2024, we are capitalized into the second half of 2026. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. We may require additional capital for the further development and commercialization of our product candidates, including funding our internal manufacturing capabilities and may need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate. 
 We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Other than the funding agreement and our Loan Agreement (as defined below) with Banc of California (formerly known as Pacific Western Bank), we have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates or other research and development initiatives. Our license agreements may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment obligations under the agreements. We could be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves. Additionally, United States and global economic uncertainty, higher interest rates and diminished credit availability may limit our ability to incur indebtedness on favorable terms. Furthermore, the impact of geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the United States and China, an escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine or the ongoing armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza strip, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions, also could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets, which may have an impact on our ability to obtain additional funding. 
 Any of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 We have grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow the size of our organization, and it may experience difficulties in managing this growth. 
 As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, and as we have transitioned into operating as a public company, we have rapidly expanded our employee base and expect to continue to add managerial, operational, sales, research and development, marketing, financial and other personnel. Current and future growth imposes significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: 
 identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees; 

managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and FDA review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and 

improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. 

Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of our attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. 
 We currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants, pursuant to arrangements which expire after a certain period of time, to provide certain services, including certain research and development as well as general and administrative support. There can be no assurance that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or 
 45 

otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all. 
 If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 We may form or seek strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements. 
 We may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we license products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. For instance, our License and Collaboration Agreement (the Regeneron Agreement) with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) requires significant research and development commitments that may not result in the development and commercialization of product candidates. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the results, revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Doing Business in China and Our International Operations 
 The pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated and such regulations, including the Foreign Investment Law and the negative list, are subject to change which may affect development approval and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 The pharmaceutical industry in China is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, encompassing the development, approval, registration, manufacturing, packaging, licensing and marketing of new drugs. For example, under the People's Republic of China (PRC) law, before we or our subsidiaries commence a clinical trial with Shanghai Adicet Biotechnology Co., Ltd., our variable interest entity (the Adicet VIE), an approval or filing, as the case may be, needs to be obtained in advance for any projects in respect of human genetic resources in order to collect any biological samples that contain the genetic material of Chinese human subjects. Any failure to obtain such approval or filing could cause such projects to be suspended by governing authorities, and may result in fines. Investigator-initiated trials cannot be implemented in a medical and healthcare institution without first being approved by such medical and healthcare institution. Such medical and healthcare institution shall file such approval to the medical and healthcare authority which issues its operating license for record. Furthermore, under relevant PRC laws, a license for use of laboratory animals is required for performing experimentation on animals. Any failure to fully comply with such requirement may result in the invalidation of our experimental data. In recent years, the regulatory framework in China regarding the pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant changes, and we expect that it will continue to undergo significant changes. Any such changes or amendments may result in increased compliance costs on our business or cause delays in or prevent the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates in China and reduce the current benefits we believe are available to us from developing and manufacturing drugs in China. PRC authorities have become increasingly vigilant in enforcing laws in the pharmaceutical industry and any failure by us or our partners to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations or obtain and maintain required licenses and permits may result in the suspension or termination of our business activities in China. We believe our strategy and approach are aligned with the PRC government s regulatory policies, but we cannot ensure that our strategy and approach will continue to be aligned. 
 In addition, the Foreign Investment Law in China grants foreign invested entities the same treatment as PRC domestic entities, except for those foreign invested entities that operate in industries deemed to be either restricted or prohibited in the negative list published by the Ministry of Commerce, and the National Development and Reform Commission (2024 Negative List). We and our PRC subsidiary, Adicet (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Adicet Shanghai), a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE), are currently considered to be a foreign invested entity in China. 
 46 

The 2024 Negative List provides that foreign investment is prohibited in the development and application of human stem cell or gene diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. As of October 2024, there has been no official interpretation of the scope of human stem cell or gene diagnostic and therapeutic technologies and the application of this regulation remains unclear. If discovering and developing our allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies are deemed by relevant PRC regulatory agencies as falling into the category of human stem cell or gene diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, Adicet Shanghai would be prohibited from engaging in the research or development of such technologies. To comply with the PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our research and development activities in PRC through the Adicet VIE. It is also noted that in September 2024, Ministry of Commerce, National Healthcare Commission and National Medical Products Administration of PRC jointly announce a pilot policy (2024 Pilot Policy) to allow foreign invested entities in Free Trade Zone of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Hainan to develop human stem cell or gene diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, the application of 2024 Pilot Policy remains unclear. 
 Any of the above factors may affect the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

The uncertainties in the PRC legal system regarding the Foreign Investment Law may subject our contractual arrangements to different interpretations or enforcement challenges, or subject us to severe penalties or force us to relinquish our interests in our operations. 
 In May 2024, we formed Adicet Shanghai, located in Shanghai, PRC, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Adicet Therapeutics. Through Adicet Shanghai, we operate our business in PRC pursuant to a series of contractual arrangements between Adicet Shanghai and the Adicet VIE, and the Adicet VIE s shareholders, which enable us to (i) direct the activities of the Adicet VIE that most significantly impact the Adicet VIE s economic performance, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the Adicet VIE and its subsidiary, and (iii) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests and assets in the Adicet VIE, when and to the extent permitted by PRC laws. As a result of these contractual arrangements, Adicet Therapeutics is considered the primary beneficiary of the Adicet VIE and the Adicet VIE s subsidiaries for accounting purposes and is able to consolidate the financial results of the Adicet VIE in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Investors in our common stock do not hold any ownership interest, directly or indirectly, in the Adicet VIE in China, and we merely have a contractual relationship with the operating entity in China. 
 Our PRC legal counsel based on its understanding of the relevant laws and regulations, is of the opinion that (i) the ownership structure of Adicet Shanghai and the Adicet VIE are in compliance with applicable PRC laws or regulations and (ii) such contractual arrangements constitute valid, legal and binding obligations enforceable against each party of such agreements in accordance with the terms of each agreement, and will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect. However, our PRC legal counsel has also advised us that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. 
 If we, Adicet Shanghai or the Adicet VIE are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures, including: 
 revoking the business licenses and/or operating licenses of such entities; 

discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operation through any transactions between the WFOE and the Adicet VIE; 

imposing fines, confiscating the income from Adicet Shanghai or the Adicet VIE, or imposing other requirements with which we or the Adicet VIE may not be able to comply; 

requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual arrangements with the Adicet VIE and deregistering the equity pledges of the Adicet VIE, which in turn would affect our ability to consolidate or derive economic interests from the Adicet VIE; or 

restricting or prohibiting use of any of our offering proceeds to finance our business and operations in China, and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. 

The imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. In addition, it is unclear what impact the PRC government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of the Adicet VIE in our consolidated financial statements, if the PRC government authorities were to find our legal structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations. If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of the Adicet VIE or our right to receive substantially all the economic benefits and residual returns from the Adicet VIE and we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and 
 47 

operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to be considered the primary beneficiary of the Adicet VIE for accounting purposes or consolidate the financial results of the Adicet VIE in our consolidated financial statements. Either of these results, or any other significant penalties that might be imposed on us in this event, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We rely on contractual arrangements with the Adicet VIE and its shareholders to undertake the activities of the Adicet VIE that most significantly impact the Adicet VIE s economic performance, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. 
 We have relied and expect to continue to rely on contractual arrangements with the Adicet VIE and its shareholders to operate our business in China. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership of the Adicet VIE. For example, the Adicet VIE and its shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. 
 If we had direct ownership of the Adicet VIE, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of the Adicet VIE, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by the Adicet VIE and its shareholders of their respective obligations under the contracts to direct the activities of the Adicet VIE that most significantly impact the Adicet VIE s economic performance. The shareholders of the Adicet VIE may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain portion of our business through the contractual arrangements with the Adicet VIE. If any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through arbitration, litigation or other legal proceedings and therefore will be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Therefore, our contractual arrangements with the Adicet VIE may not be as effective in controlling our business operations as direct ownership. 
 
 Our contractual arrangements with the Adicet VIE and its shareholders are governed by PRC law. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law, and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures, which may not protect us as much as those of other jurisdictions, such as the United States. 
 All the agreements under our contractual arrangements with the Adicet VIE and its shareholders are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC law. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such arbitration should legal action become necessary. In addition, under PRC law, rulings by arbitrators are final, parties cannot appeal the arbitration results in courts, and if the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional expenses and delay. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected. 

Changes in U.S. and Chinese regulations may impact our business, financial condition, and our operating results. 
 The U.S. government, including the SEC, has made statements and taken certain actions that led to changes to United States and international relations, and will impact companies with connections to the United States or China, including imposing several rounds of tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China, imposing certain sanctions and restrictions in relation to China and issuing statements indicating enhanced review of companies with certain operations based in China. It is unknown whether and to what extent new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws or regulations will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on companies with significant connections to the United States or to China, our industry or on us. We conduct research activities and have business operations both in the United States and China. Any unfavorable government policies on cross-border relations and/or international trade, including increased scrutiny on companies with certain operations based in China, capital controls or tariffs, may affect the competitive position of our product candidates, the hiring of scientists and other research and development personnel, the demand for our product candidates, the import or export of raw materials in relation to drug development, our ability to raise capital, or prevent us from selling our product candidates in certain countries. Furthermore, the SEC has issued statements primarily focused on companies with certain operations based in China, such as us. For example, in 2021, the Chairman of the SEC, issued a Statement on Investor Protection Related to Recent Developments in China, pursuant to which he stated that he has asked the SEC staff to engage in targeted additional reviews of filings for companies with certain operations based in China. The statement also addressed risks inherent in companies with variable interest entity structures. 
 48 

If any new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws and/or regulations are implemented, if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if the U.S. or Chinese governments take retaliatory actions due to the recent U.S.-China tension, such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be restricted from transferring our scientific data abroad. 
 On March 17, 2018, the General Office of the PRC State Council promulgated the Measures for the Management of Scientific Data (the Scientific Data Measures), which provide a broad definition of scientific data and relevant rules for the management of scientific data. According to the Scientific Data Measures, enterprises in China must seek governmental approval before any scientific data involving a state secret may be transferred abroad or to foreign parties. Further, researchers conducting research funded, at least in part, by the PRC government may be required to submit relevant scientific data for management by the entity to which such researcher is affiliated before such data may be published in any foreign academic journal. Currently, as the term state secret is not clearly defined, there is no assurance that we can always obtain relevant approvals for sending scientific data (such as the results of our preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted within China) abroad, or to our foreign partners in China. 
 If we are unable to obtain the necessary approvals in a timely manner, or at all, our research and development of product candidates may be hindered, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial conditions and prospects. If relevant government authorities consider the transmission of our scientific data to be in violation of the requirements under the Scientific Data Measures, we may be subject to specific administrative penalties imposed by those government authorities. 
 
 Compliance with China s Data Security Law, Cyber Security Law, Personal Information Protection Law, regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme on cyber security and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could affect our business. 
 China has implemented or will implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China s new Data Security Law took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on data classification and hierarchical protection system for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government. 
 Additionally, China s Cyber Security Law, promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress in 2016 and came into effect in 2017, and the Administrative Measures for the Hierarchical Protection of Information Security promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security, National Administration of State Secrets Protection, State Cryptography Administration and other government authority in 2007, requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary measures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that China adopts a multi-level protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure that the network is free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and the conditions of their information and network systems to determine the level of the entity s information and network systems. These levels range from the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to a series of national standards on the grading and implementation of the classified protection of cyber security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities must comply with. Entities classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination and approval. 
 Also, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress released the Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective in 2021. The Personal Information Protection Law provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The Personal Information Protection Law also provides that critical information infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the Personal Information Protection Law contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to Renminbi 50 million or 5 of annual revenues from the prior year and may also be ordered to suspend any related activity by competent authorities. With regard to the cross-border transfer of personal information, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flows in 2024. The Regulations on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flows establishes the latest regulatory framework for the cross-border transfer of personal information. The personal information handler should pass the security assessment, submit the standard contract signed for the provision of personal information abroad, or be certified by a specialized agency for the 
 49 

protection of personal information authentication before the cross-border transfer of the personal information when certain threshold provided in the Regulations on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flows is reached. 
 In addition, certain industry-specific laws and regulations affect the collection and transfer of data in the PRC. The Regulations on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources of the PRC (the HGR Regulation), promulgated by the State Council, came into effect in 2019 and was thereafter revised in 2024. It stipulates that foreign organizations, individuals, and the entities established or actually controlled by foreign organizations or individuals are forbidden to collect, preserve and export China s human genetic resources. Foreign organizations and the entities established or actually controlled by foreign organizations or individuals may only utilize and be provided with China s human genetic resources after satisfaction of all requirements under the HGR Regulation and other applicable laws, such as (i) China s human genetic resources being utilized only in international cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions, universities, medical institutions, and enterprises for scientific research and clinical trials after completion of requisite approval or filing formalities with competent governmental authorities, and (ii) China s human genetic resources information being provided after required filing and information backup procedures have been gone through. In 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress promulgated the Biosecurity Law of the PRC, which was later amended in 2024, and it reaffirms the regulatory requirements stipulated by the HGR Regulation while potentially increasing the administrative sanctions where China s human genetic resources are collected, preserved, exported or used in international cooperation in violation of applicable laws. The Ministry of Science and Technology published the Implementing Rules for the Regulations on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources (the HGR Implementing Rules), which came into effect in 2023. The HGR Implementing Rules have, among other things, further clarified the scope of China s human genetic resources information, improved the procedure rules for applicable approval, filing and security review, and refined the provisions with respect to the forbiddance on the collection, preservation and export of China s human genetic resources by foreign organizations, individuals, and the entities established or actually controlled by foreign organizations or individuals. There remain significant uncertainties as to how various provisions of the HGR Regulation and the related laws and regulations may be interpreted and implemented. Given such uncertainty, although we have made great efforts to comply with mandatory requirements of laws and government authorities in this regard, we cannot assure you that we will be deemed at all times in full compliance with the HGR Regulation, the Biosecurity Law of the PRC, the HGR Implementing Rules and other applicable laws in our utilizing of and dealing with China s human genetic resources. As a result, we may be exposed to compliance risks under the HGR Regulation, the Biosecurity Law of the PRC and the HGR Implementing Rules. 
 Interpretation, application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation or changes in enforcement. Compliance with China s new Cyber Security Law and Data Security Law could significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on us by the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties from contracting with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private claims or litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our practices are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by the Data Security Law, the recent Chinese government actions could adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital, including engaging in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market. 
 
 Pharmaceutical companies operating in China are required to comply with extensive regulations and hold a number of permits and licenses to carry on their business. Our ability to obtain and maintain these regulatory approvals is uncertain, and future government regulation may place additional burdens on our current and planned operations in China. 
 The pharmaceutical industry in China is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision. The regulatory framework addresses all aspects of operating in the pharmaceutical industry, including product development activities, clinical trials, registration, production, distribution, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment, advertising, licensing and post-approval pharmacovigilance certification requirements and procedures, periodic renewal and reassessment processes, data security and data privacy protection requirements and compliance and environmental protection. Violation of applicable laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business by impacting the Adicet VIE through which we conduct certain research and development activities. The regulatory framework governing the pharmaceutical industry in China is subject to change and amendment from time to time. Any such change or amendment could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and prospects. The Chinese government has introduced various reforms to the Chinese healthcare system in recent years and may continue to do so, with an overall objective to expand basic medical insurance coverage and improve the quality and reliability of healthcare services. The specific regulatory changes under the various reform initiatives remain uncertain. The implementing measures to be issued may not be sufficiently effective to achieve the stated goals, and as a result, 
 50 

we may not be able to benefit from such reform to the extent we expect, if at all. Moreover, the various reform initiatives could give rise to regulatory developments, such as more burdensome administrative procedures, which may have an adverse effect on our business and prospects. 
 
 We may be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of China and other countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. and certain foreign export controls, trade sanctions and import laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements could limit our ability to compete in foreign markets and any determination that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business or our reputation. 
 Our operations are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of China and other countries in which we operate. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from, directly or indirectly, offering, authorizing or making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantage. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. As our business expands, the applicability of the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws to our operations will increase. If our procedures and controls to monitor anti-bribery compliance fail to protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents or if we, or our employees, agents, contractors or other collaborators, fail to comply with applicable anti-bribery laws, our reputation could be harmed and we could incur criminal or civil penalties, other sanctions and/or significant expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. 
 In addition, our products may be subject to U.S. and foreign export controls, trade sanctions and import laws and regulations. Governmental regulation of the import or export of our products, or our failure to obtain any required import or export authorization for our products, when applicable, could harm our international or domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, penalties could be imposed, including fines and/or denial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons or products targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business. 
 
 Any failure to comply with Chinese regulations regarding the registration requirements for our employee equity incentive plans may subject us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In 2012, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies (the Stock Option Rules). In accordance with the Stock Option Rules and other relevant rules and regulations, Chinese citizens or non-Chinese citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a Chinese subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain procedures. Our employees who are Chinese citizens or who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year and who participate in our stock incentive plans are subject to such regulation. We plan to assist our employees to register their equity awards. However, any failure of our Chinese individual beneficial owners and holders of equity awards to comply with the SAFE registration requirements may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may limit the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to distribute dividends to us. We also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional incentive plans for our employees under Chinese law. 
 Risks Related to Business Disruptions 
 Business disruptions, including armed conflicts, could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. 
 Our operations, and those of our CDMO, CROs and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, armed conflicts, medical epidemics, such as public health crises or other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. 
 51 

Our ability to manufacture our product candidates could be disrupted if our operations or those of our suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster, the severity and frequency of which may be amplified by global climate change, or other business interruptions. We have facilities located in California near major earthquake faults and fire zones. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster. 
 Global conflicts may increase the likelihood of supply interruptions which could impact our ability to find the materials we need to make our product candidates. 
 Ongoing conflicts, including conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas and a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the United States and PRC, may increase the likelihood of supply interruptions and hinder our ability to find the materials we need to make our product candidates. Supply disruptions make it more difficult for us to find favorable pricing and reliable sources for the materials we need, which increases pressure on our costs and increases the risk that we may be unable to acquire the necessary goods and services to successfully manufacture our product candidates. If we were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in preclinical studies or clinical trials, such as our ongoing or planned clinical trials of ADI-001, could be delayed or suspended. Any delay or interruption in the supply of trial materials could delay the completion of such trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining these research and development activities and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new preclinical studies or clinical trials at additional expense or terminate such trials completely. 
 Changes in the political and economic policies or in relations between China and the United States may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Due to our operations in China, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be influenced to a certain degree by economic, political, legal and social conditions in China or changes in government relations between China and the United States or other governments. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations, which could result in a change in our operations. Any economic downturn, whether actual or perceived, further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the global macroeconomic environment is facing challenges. It is unclear whether these challenges and uncertainties will be contained or resolved, and what effects they may have on the global political and economic conditions, and our business operations in the long term. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. Due to our operations in China, any future Chinese, U.S. or other rules and regulations that place restrictions on capital raising or other activities by companies with operations in China could affect our business and results of operations. If the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment, or if relations between China and the United States or other governments deteriorate and geopolitical tensions between China and the United States increase, our business in China and United States may also be affected. 
 Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the approval of our product candidates rely, which would negatively impact our business. 
 The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, adequate staffing, furloughs, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 
 Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the past decade, the U.S. government has shut down several times, and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue to fund our operations.

Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation 
 Our relationships with customers, physicians including clinical investigators, CROs and third-party payors are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, transparency laws, government price reporting and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we or our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, vendors, or other agents violate these laws, we could face substantial penalties. 
 These laws may impact, among other things, our clinical research program, as well as our proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services is subject to extensive laws and regulations designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive and other business arrangements. We may also be subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of identifiable patient information. For further discussion on U.S. healthcare regulations, see the section entitled Business Government Regulation and Product Approval Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, or our arrangements with physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors violate these laws, we may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions and/or significant penalties. 
 We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct or business noncompliance, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending themselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. 
 Data protection, privacy and similar laws restrict access, use, and disclosure of information, and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business. 
 We are subject to federal and state data privacy and security laws and regulations, and laws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve. Changes in these laws may limit our data access, use and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures. In addition, data protection, privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and, although they vary by jurisdiction, these laws can extend to employee information, business contact information, provider information, and other information relating to identifiable individuals. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires covered businesses to, among other things, provide notices to California consumers regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such consumers personal information and afford such consumers new rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to opt out of certain sales of personal information. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amended the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2023 and imposed additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation. The CPRA modified the CCPA and has created a state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA. There are also states that are specifically regulating health information. For example, Washington state recently passed a health privacy law that will regulate the collection and sharing of health information, and the law also has a private right of action, which further increases the relevant compliance risk. Since then, similar laws have been passed in numerous other states and other states have proposed similar new privacy laws. 
 53 

We believe that increased regulation in additional jurisdictions is likely in the area of data privacy. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide services to patients and, in turn, our results of operations. 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area (EEA) is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to ensuring an appropriate legal basis or condition applies to the processing of personal data, stricter requirements relating to obtaining consent from data subjects, stricter requirements around the collection of sensitive data (such as health data), expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments for high risk processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and privacy by design requirements, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. 
 Following the United Kingdom s (UK) exit from the European Union (EU), the UK s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union s data protection regime. Although the GDPR and the UK GDPR currently impose substantially similar obligations, it is possible that over time the UK GDPR could become less aligned with the GDPR. The UK Government has also now introduced a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (the UK Bill) into the UK legislative process with the intention for this bill to reform the UK s data protection regime following Brexit. If passed, the final version of the UK Bill may have the effect of further altering the similarities between the UK and EU data protection regime. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. This lack of clarity on future UK laws and regulations and their interaction with EU laws and regulations could add legal risk, uncertainty, complexity and cost to our handling of EU personal information and our privacy and data security compliance programs and could require us to implement different compliance measures for the UK and the EU. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 17.5 million or 4 of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the European Union s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing. 
 To enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with European and UK data protection laws. The European Commission has issued forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The UK is not subject to the EC s new standard contractual clauses but has published the UK International Data Transfer Agreement and International Data Transfer Addendum to the new standard contractual clauses (the IDTA), which enable transfers from the UK. For new transfers, the IDTA already needs to be in place, and must be in place for all existing transfers from the UK from March 21, 2024. Following a ruling from the Court of Justice of the EU, in Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems, Case C-311/18 (Schrems II), companies relying on standard contractual clauses to govern transfers of personal data to third countries (in particular the United States) will need to assess whether the data importer can ensure sufficient guarantees for safeguarding the personal data under GDPR. This assessment includes assessing whether third party vendors can also ensure these guarantees. The same assessment is required for transfers governed by the IDTA. Further, the EU and United States have adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Framework), which entered into force on July 11, 2023. This Framework provides that the protection of personal data transferred between the EU and the United States is comparable to that offered in the EU. This provides a further avenue to ensuring transfers to the United States are carried out in line with GDPR. There has been an extension to the Framework to cover UK transfers to the United States. The Framework could be challenged like its predecessor frameworks. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost. 
 Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR or UK GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million or 4 of a company s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR and UK GDPR grant data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR or UK GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR and UK GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 In addition, many other jurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or enacting new and/or amended comprehensive data protection legislation. We also continue to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws. These 
 54 

regulations may interfere with our intended business activities, inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs. Because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws (including the GDPR), commercial frameworks, and standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, frameworks, and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices and policies. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, breach of contract claims, and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and security or data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our ability to conduct trials, and adversely affect our business. 
 Data protection, privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and, although they vary by jurisdiction, these laws can extend to employee information, business contact information, provider information, and other information relating to identifiable individuals. Failure to comply with these laws may result in, among other things, civil and criminal liability, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and liability under contractual provisions. In addition, compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that wet not offer certain types of services in the future. 
 
 Artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that can impact our business including by posing security risks to our confidential information, proprietary information, and personal data. 
 
 Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations. As with many technological innovations, artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that could impact our business. We expect to see increasing government and supranational regulation related to artificial intelligence use and ethics, which may also significantly increase the burden and cost of research, development and compliance in this area. For example, the EU s Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) the world s first comprehensive AI law, entered into force in August 1, 2024 and, with some exceptions, will become effective 12 months thereafter. This legislation imposes significant obligations on providers and deployers of high risk artificial intelligence systems, and encourages providers and deployers of artificial intelligence systems to account for EU ethical principles in their development and use of these systems. If we develop or use AI systems that are governed by the AI Act, it may necessitate ensuring higher standards of data quality, transparency, and human oversight, as well as adhering to specific and potentially burdensome and costly ethical, accountability, and administrative requirements. We may adopt and integrate generative artificial intelligence tools into our systems for specific use cases reviewed by legal and information security. Our vendors may incorporate generative artificial intelligence tools into their offerings without disclosing this use to us, and the providers of these generative artificial intelligence tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards with respect to privacy and data protection and may inhibit our or our vendors ability to maintain an adequate level of service and experience. If we, our vendors, or our third-party partners experience an actual or perceived breach or privacy or security incident because of the use of generative artificial intelligence, we may lose valuable intellectual property and confidential information and our reputation and the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of artificial intelligence, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information, and intellectual property. Any of these outcomes could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information, and adversely impact our business. 
 Risks Related to Our Financial Position 
 
 Raising funds through lending arrangements may restrict our operations or produce other adverse results. 
 Our current Loan and Security Agreement with Banc of California (formerly known as Pacific Western Bank), as amended on July 8, 2020, September 14, 2020, September 15, 2020, October 21, 2021, December 2, 2022 and May 30, 2023 (the Loan Agreement), allows for Non-Formula Ancillary Services which shall not exceed 5.5 million in the aggregate. Non-Formula Ancillary Services are defined as automated clearinghouse transactions, corporate credit card services, letters of credit, or other treasury management services. The Loan Agreement contains a variety of affirmative and negative covenants, including required financial reporting, requirements to maintain certain balances at Banc of California, limitations on certain dispositions of assets, limitations on the incurrence of additional debt and other requirements. To secure our performance of our obligations under this Loan Agreement, we granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than certain intellectual property assets, to Banc of California and issued a warrant to purchase our capital stock. 
 On May 30, 2023, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Loan Agreement, dated as of May 30, 2023 (the 2023 Loan Amendment). Pursuant to the 2023 Loan Amendment, we must maintain the lesser of (i) 35.0 million or (ii) all of the 
 55 

Company s combined balances in demand deposit accounts, money market accounts, and/or insured cash sweep accounts with Banc of California. If our total cash and investments drop to less than 35.0 million, the 2023 Loan Amendment permits us to maintain cash and/or investments in one or more accounts outside of Banc of California up to a total of 2.5 million. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we were in compliance with such covenants. 
 Our failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement, including as a result of changing the position of certain of our accounts, failure to transfer funds back to Banc of California at expiration of the Letter, the occurrence of a material impairment in our prospect of repayment operations, business or financial condition, our ability to repay the loan, or in the value, perfection or priority of Banc of California s lien on our assets, as determined by Banc of California, or the occurrence of certain other specified events could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the cancellation of our Non-Formula Ancillary Services under the Loan Agreement, potential foreclosure on our assets and other adverse results. Additionally, we are bound by certain negative covenants setting forth actions that are not permitted to be taken during the term of the Loan Agreement without consent of Banc of California, including, without limitation, incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain asset dispositions, entering into certain mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions or incurring any non-permitted lien or other encumbrance on our assets. The foregoing prohibitions and constraints on our operations could result in our inability to: (a) acquire promising intellectual property or other assets on desired timelines or terms; (b) reduce costs by disposing of assets or business segments no longer deemed advantageous to retain; (c) reallocate certain of our cash deposits and money market accounts depending on various global banking events; (d) stimulate further corporate growth or development through the assumption of additional debt; or (e) enter into other arrangements that necessitate the imposition of a lien on corporate assets. Moreover, if the conditions set forth in the consent provided by Banc of California are not satisfied, or if we do not comply with the terms of the Letter, we would effectively need to terminate the Loan Agreement and repay any outstanding loan funds or refinance the facility with another lender. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, no amounts have been drawn under the Loan Agreement. 
 Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and its financial condition and results of operations. 
 Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Although a statement by the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC stated all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money after only one business day of closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments with SVB, Signature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. Although we are not a borrower or party to any such instruments with SVB, Signature or any other financial institution currently in receivership, if any of our lenders or counterparties to any such instruments, including Banc of California or its affiliates, were to be placed into receivership, we may be unable to access such funds. In addition, counterparties to SVB credit agreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may experience direct impacts from the closure of SVB and uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the 2008-2010 financial crisis. 
 Inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to 25 billion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediately liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion. 
 Although we assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial institutions with which we have credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could 
 56 

involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which we have financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. 
 The results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, the following: 
 d elayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets; 

loss of access to revolving existing credit facilities or other working capital sources and/or the inability to refund, roll over or extend the maturity of, or enter into new credit facilities or other working capital resources; 

potential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require us to maintain letters or credit or other credit support arrangements; 

potential or actual breach of financial covenants in our credit agreements or credit arrangements; 

potential or actual cross-defaults in other credit agreements, credit arrangements or operating or financing agreements; or 

termination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. 

Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and negatively impact the value of our common stock. 
 Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements, or may identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 
 We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are non-accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. We will remain a non-accelerated filer as long as we qualify to be a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which will be for as long as either (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million as of the prior June 30. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that our management s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. 
 We expect to continue our efforts to improve our control processes, though there can be no assurance that our efforts will ultimately be successful or avoid potential future material weaknesses, and we expect to continue incurring additional costs as a result of these efforts. If we are unable to successfully remediate any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. We also could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could harm our reputation and our financial condition, or divert financial and management resources from our core business. 
 Risks Related to Taxation 
 Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 
 Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change (generally defined as one or more shareholders or groups of shareholders who own at least 5 percent of the corporation s equity increasing their equity ownership in the aggregate by a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) over a three-year period), the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and certain 
 57 

other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced such ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As of September 30, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 294.8 million, and our ability to utilize those net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by an ownership change as described above or subject to other limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. 
 Changes in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, under Section 174 of the code, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, expenses that are incurred for research and development in the U.S. are capitalized and amortized, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation. 
 Additional changes to U.S. federal income tax law are currently being contemplated, and future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our or our stockholders tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the implications of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock. 
 Risks Related to Third Parties 
 If our collaboration with Regeneron is terminated, or if Regeneron materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed. 
 Our financial performance may be significantly affected by our Regeneron collaboration that we have entered into to develop next-generation engineered immune-cell therapeutics with fully human CARs and TCRs directed to disease-specific cell surface antigens in order to enable the precise engagement and killing of tumor cells. Under the Regeneron Agreement, Regeneron paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of 25.0 million and an aggregate of 20.0 million of additional payments for research funding as of September 30, 2024, and we will collaborate with Regeneron to identify and validate targets and develop a pipeline of engineered immune-cell therapeutics for selected targets. Regeneron has the option to obtain development and commercial rights for a certain number of the product candidates developed by the parties, subject to an option payment for each product candidate. On January 28, 2022, we received a payment of 20.0 million from Regeneron for exercise of its option to license exclusive rights to ADI-002, and we completed the transfer of the associated license rights to Regeneron in the first quarter of 2022. If Regeneron exercises its option on a given product candidate, we then have an option to participate in the development and commercialization for such product. If we do not exercise our option, we will be entitled to royalties on any future sales of such products by Regeneron. We did not exercise our option to participate in the development and commercialization of ADI-002. In addition to developing CARs and TCRs for use in novel immune-cell therapies as part of the collaboration, Regeneron will have the right to use these CARs and TCRs in our other antibody programs outside of the collaboration. Regeneron will also be entitled to royalties on any future sales of products developed and commercialized by us under the agreement. If Regeneron were to terminate our collaboration agreement with us, we may not have the resources or skills to replace those of our collaborator, which could require us to seek additional funding or another collaboration that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant delays in development and/or commercialization efforts and result in substantial additional costs to us. Termination of such collaboration agreement or the loss of rights provided to us under such agreement may create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of our products and could materially harm our financial condition and operating results. 
 Regeneron may change its strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced, delayed or no revenue to us under the agreement. Regeneron has a variety of marketed products and product candidates either by itself or under collaboration with other companies, including some of our competitors, and the corporate objectives of Regeneron may not be consistent with our best interests. Regeneron may change its position regarding its participation and funding of our and Regeneron joint activities, which may impact our ability to successfully pursue the program. 
 58 

Our existing and future collaborations will be important to our business. If we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected. 
 We have entered, and plan to enter, into collaborations with other companies, including our collaboration agreement with Regeneron and discovery agreement with Twist Bioscience Corporation (Twist), that we believe can provide us with additional capabilities beneficial to our business. The collaboration with Regeneron has provided us with important technologies, expertise and funding for our programs and technology. Under our discovery agreement with Twist, Twist will utilize its proprietary platform technology to assist us with the discovery of novel antibodies related to our gamma delta T cell therapy programs. We may receive additional technologies, expertise and funding under other collaborations in the future. Our existing therapeutic collaborations, and any future collaborations we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including the following: 
 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply; 

collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected; 

collaborators may dispute the amounts of payments owed; 

collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs or license arrangements based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as a strategic transaction that may divert resources or create competing priorities; 

collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; 

collaborators could develop independently, or with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products and product candidates if the collaborators believe that the competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; 

product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with our own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates; 

collaborators may dispute ownership or rights in jointly developed technologies or intellectual property; 

collaborators may fail to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements regarding the development, manufacture, sale, distribution or marketing of a product candidate or product; 

collaborators with sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the sale, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of such product or products; 

disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation, payment obligations or the preferred course of discovery, development, sales or marketing, might cause delays or terminations of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional and burdensome responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive; 

collaborators may not properly maintain or defend their or our relevant intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation and liability; 

collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; 

if a collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination or cessation, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us; and 

collaborations may be terminated by the collaborator, and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates, or potentially lose access to the collaborator s intellectual property. 

If our therapeutic collaborations do not result in the successful discovery, development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates our agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our 
 59 

development and commercialization of our technology and product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates and our technology. All of the risks relating to product discovery, development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in these risk factors also apply to the activities of our therapeutic collaborators. 
 In addition to the Regeneron collaboration described above, for some of our programs, we may in the future determine to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for discovery, development and potential commercialization of therapeutic products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators because, for example, third parties also have rights to allogeneic T cell technologies. For example, in April 2020, Johnson Johnson entered into a collaboration agreement with Fate Therapeutics, a company that is also using allogeneic T cell technologies, for up to four CAR Natural Killer and CAR T-cell therapies. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail discovery efforts or the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential manufacture or commercialization, or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our expense. If we elect to fund and undertake discovery, development, manufacturing or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates, manufacture the product candidates, bring them to market or continue to develop our technology and our business may be materially and adversely affected. 
 We are subject to certain exclusivity obligations under our agreement with Regeneron. 
 During the five-year period following the effective date of the Regeneron Agreement, with certain limited exceptions, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize a gamma delta immune cell product (ICP) or grant a license to do the foregoing, except pursuant to the terms of the Regeneron Agreement. Both parties also have obligations not to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize an ICP with the same target as one being developed under a research program or commercialized by a party (and royalty bearing under the agreement), for so long as such activities are occurring. These exclusivity obligations are limited to engineered gamma delta immune cells to targets reasonably considered to have therapeutic relevance in cancer. If our collaboration with Regeneron is not successful, including any failure caused by the risks listed in the preceding paragraphs, and the agreement and research programs are not terminated, we may not be able to enter into collaborations with other companies with respect to ICPs and our business could be adversely affected. 
 The exclusivity obligations under the Regeneron Agreement expired on July 29, 2021. Prior to this expiration date, our ability to advance any gamma delta immune cell therapeutics outside of the scope of the research plan agreed on with Regeneron was limited. The restrictions on internal development under the Regeneron Agreement could lead to delays in our ability to discover and develop gamma delta immune cell therapeutics for targets not covered by the collaboration with Regeneron and loss of opportunities to obtain additional research funding and advance our own technologies separately from the Regeneron collaboration. If we are delayed in our ability to advance our technologies due to the Regeneron Agreement, our business could be harmed. 
 We rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize our product candidates. 
 We currently depend and will continue to depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, CROs and strategic partners to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. 
 We negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs and study sites, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We will rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with biologic product produced under cGMPs and will require a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, 
 60 

which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws. 
 Any third parties conducting our clinical trials are and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. 
 If any of our relationships with trial sites, or any CRO that we may use in the future, terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative trial sites or CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding third parties to conduct our clinical trials will involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. 
 We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical product supplies, and we may have to rely on third parties to produce and process our product candidates, if approved. 
 We currently utilize, and expect to continue to utilize, third parties to manufacture our product candidates. If the field of cell therapy continues to expand, we may encounter increasing competition and costs for these materials and services. Demand for third-party manufacturing in cell therapy may grow at a faster rate than existing capacity, which could disrupt our ability to find and retain third-party manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of our product candidates at an acceptable cost or at all. We have also not yet caused our product candidates to be manufactured or processed on a commercial scale and may not be able to achieve manufacturing and processing at a commercial scale and therefore may be unable to create an inventory of mass-produced, "off-the-shelf" product to satisfy demands for any of our product candidates. 
 We do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of the commercial manufacturing and processing of our product candidates, and the actual cost to manufacture and process our product candidates could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our product candidates. As a result, we may never be able to develop a commercially viable product. 
 In addition, we anticipate reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to the following risks: 
 We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA may have questions regarding any replacement contractor. This may require new testing and regulatory interactions. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products; 

Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any; 

Contract manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures appropriately; 

Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products; 

Manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards; 

We may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our products; and 

Our third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreement(s) with us. 

61 

If any CDMO with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we may not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with a different CDMO, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In either scenario, our clinical trials supply could be delayed significantly as we establish alternative supply sources. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original CDMO and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change CDMOs for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new CDMO maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations. We will also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product candidates according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays associated with the verification of a new CDMO could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner or within budget. Furthermore, a CDMO may possess technology related to the manufacture of our product candidates that such CDMO owns independently. This would increase our reliance on such CDMO or require us to obtain a license from such CDMO in order to have another CDMO manufacture our product candidates. In addition, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in manufacturing procedures and processes, which could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and that of any new manufacturer. We may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies which could require the conduct of additional clinical trials. 
 Our contract manufacturers would also be subject to the same risks we face in developing our own manufacturing capabilities, as described above. Each of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue. In addition, we will rely on third parties to perform release tests on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately done and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm. 
 Cell-based therapies rely on the availability of specialty raw materials, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Our product candidates require many specialty raw materials, including viral vectors that deliver the targeting moiety and other genes to the product candidate. We currently manufacture through contract manufacturers, some of which have limited resources and experience supporting a commercial product, and such suppliers may not be able to deliver raw materials to our specifications. Those suppliers normally support blood-based hospital businesses and generally do not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under cGMP by biopharmaceutical firms. The suppliers may be ill-equipped to support our needs, especially in non-routine circumstances like an FDA inspection or medical crisis, such as widespread contamination. We also do not have contracts with many of these suppliers, and we may not be able to contract with them on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key raw materials to support clinical or commercial manufacturing. 
 In addition, some raw materials utilized in the manufacture of our candidates are currently available from a single supplier, or a small number of suppliers. We cannot be sure that these suppliers will remain in business or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to produce these materials for our intended purpose. Further, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy, and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier. The time and effort to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs, diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields, any of which would negatively impact our operating results. We may be unable to enter into agreements with a new supplier on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 If we or our third-party suppliers use hazardous, non-hazardous, biological or other materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages. 
 Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials. We and our suppliers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our and our suppliers procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we and our suppliers cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 
 62 

Our internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches. 
 Our internal computer systems and the systems of our CROs, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Additionally, we operate in a hybrid work environment. As our employees and our business partners employees work from home and access our systems remotely, we may be subject to heightened security and privacy risks, including the risks of cyber attacks and privacy incidents. Cybersecurity threats may include, but are not limited to, social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), business email compromise, online and offline fraud, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks, access attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, and telecommunications failures among other cybersecurity risks. Threat actors and their techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. We may expend significant resources to try to protect against these threats to our systems. Certain data privacy and security laws, as well as industry best practice standards, may require us to implement and maintain security measures. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our systems and confidential and sensitive data, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. 
 While we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. Other consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate or sufficient in type or amount to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices. 
 We may not realize the benefits of acquired assets or other strategic transactions. 
 We actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis. We may acquire other businesses, products or technologies as well as pursue joint ventures or investments in complementary businesses. The success of our strategic transactions, and any future strategic transactions depends on the risks and uncertainties involved including: 
 unanticipated liabilities related to acquired companies or joint ventures; 

difficulties integrating acquired personnel, technologies, and operations into our existing business; 

retention of key employees; 

diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to management of strategic alliances or joint ventures or acquisition integration challenges; 

increases in our expenses and reductions in our cash available for operations and other uses; and 

disruption in our relationships with collaborators or suppliers as a result of such a transaction; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses or joint ventures. 

If any of these risks or uncertainties occur, we may not realize the anticipated benefit of any acquisition or strategic transaction. Additionally, foreign acquisitions and joint ventures are subject to additional risks, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. 
 Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 63 

Risks Related to Government Regulation 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Approval 
 The FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates. 
 The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing, and distribution of product candidates, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. We are not permitted to market any biological drug product in the United States until we receive approval of a biologics license application (BLA) from the FDA. We have not previously submitted a BLA to the FDA, or similar approval filings to the EMA or comparable foreign authorities. A BLA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and sufficient supporting information to establish the product candidate s safety and effectiveness for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. 
 We expect the novel nature of our product candidates to create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval. For example, the FDA has limited experience with commercial development of allogeneic T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer. The FDA may also require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support licensure. The opinion of the Advisory Committee, although not binding, may have a significant impact on our ability to obtain licensure of the product candidates based on the completed clinical trials, as the FDA often adheres to the Advisory Committee s recommendations. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates may be uncertain, complex, expensive and lengthy, and approval may not be obtained. 
 We may also experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, including but not limited to: 
 obtaining regulatory authorization to begin a trial, if applicable; 

redesigning our study protocols and need to conduct additional studies as may be required by a regulator; 

governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulation or policy relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidate by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the availability of financial resources to commence and complete the planned trials; 

negotiating the terms of any collaboration agreements we may choose to initiate or conclude; 

reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; 

failure of third-party contractors, such as CROs, or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements, including GCP standards; 

clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial; 

delay or failure in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, in order to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or their suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced; 

inability to recruit and enroll suitable patients to participate in a trial; 

having patients complete a trial, including having patients enrolled in clinical trials dropping out of the trial before the product candidate is manufactured and returned to the site, or return for post-treatment follow-up; 

difficulty in having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; 

addressing any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial; 

inability to add new clinical trial sites; 

varying interpretations of the data generated from our preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

64 

the cost and timing of establishing, expanding and scaling manufacturing capabilities; 

inability to manufacture, or obtain from third parties, sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMPs, for the completion in preclinical and clinical studies; 

problems with biopharmaceutical product candidate storage, stability and distribution resulting in global supply chain disruptions; 

the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidate for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own; or 

potential unforeseen business disruptions or market fluctuations that delay our product development or clinical trials and increase our costs or expenses, such as business or operational disruptions, delays, or system failures due to malware, unauthorized access, terrorism, war, natural disasters, strikes, geopolitical conflicts, restrictions on trade, import or export restrictions, or public health crises. 

We could also encounter delays if physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs for the institutions in which such trials are being conducted or by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, or based on a recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. 
 Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. 
 We expect the product candidates we develop will be regulated as biological products, or biologics, and therefore they may be subject to competition from biosimilar products. 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act to establish an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an approved biologic. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. 
 We believe that any of our product candidates that are approved in the United States as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of reference product exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors, including under state laws, that are still developing. 
 The regulatory landscape that will govern our product candidates is uncertain; regulations relating to more established cell therapy products are still developing, and changes in regulatory requirements could result in delays or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or unexpected costs in obtaining regulatory approval. 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy and durability of effect must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 Because we are developing novel allogeneic cell immunotherapy product candidates, the regulatory requirements that we will be subject to are not entirely clear. Even with respect to more established products that fit into the category of cell therapies, the regulatory landscape is still developing. For example, regulatory requirements governing cell therapy products have 
 65 

changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Moreover, there is substantial, and sometimes uncoordinated, overlap in the regulation of existing cell therapy products. 
 Complex regulatory environments also exist in other jurisdictions in which we might consider seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates, further complicating the regulatory landscape. For example, in the EU a special committee called the Committee for Advanced Therapies was established within the EMA in accordance with Regulation No 1394/2007 on advanced-therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs, and to follow scientific developments in the field. ATMPs include somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products. These various regulatory review committees and advisory groups and new or revised guidelines that they promulgate from time to time may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Because the regulatory landscape for our gamma delta CAR T-cell product candidates is new, we may face even more cumbersome and complex regulations than those emerging for cell therapy products. Furthermore, even if our product candidates obtain required regulatory approvals, such approvals may later be withdrawn as a result of changes in regulations or the interpretation of regulations by applicable regulatory agencies. 
 Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business. 
 The FDA may disagree with our regulatory plan and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates. 
 The general approach for FDA approval of a new biologic or drug is for the sponsor to provide dispositive data from two well-controlled, Phase 3 clinical studies of the relevant biologic or drug in the relevant patient population. Phase 3 clinical studies typically involve hundreds of patients, have significant costs and take years to complete. We expect registrational trials for our product candidates to be designed to evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate in an open-label, non-comparative, two-stage, pivotal, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial in patients who have exhausted available treatment options. If the results are sufficiently compelling, we intend to discuss with the FDA submission of a BLA for the relevant product candidate. However, the process of clinical development is inherently uncertain and we do not have any agreement or guidance from the FDA that our future regulatory development plans are acceptable or will be sufficient to support submission of a BLA. For example, we may seek an accelerated approval pathway for our one or more of our product candidates from the FDA , EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If we decide to submit an application for accelerated approval, there can be no assurance that such application will be accepted or that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval for our product candidates that meet the criteria for accelerated approval. As a condition for accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval to perform post marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is permitted to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval confirmatory study or studies be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period after the date of accelerated approval was granted. FDORA also requires sponsors to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. FDORA also gives the FDA increased authority to withdraw approval of a drug or biologic granted accelerated approval on an expedited basis if the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner, send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if such post-approval studies fail to verify the drug s predicted clinical benefit. Under FDORA, the FDA is empowered to take action, such as issuing fines, against companies that fail to conduct with due diligence any post-approval confirmatory study or submit timely reports to the agency on their progress. Even if we seek to utilize the accelerated approval pathway, we may not be able to obtain accelerated approval and, even if we do, we may not experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process for that product. In addition, receiving accelerated approval does not assure that the product s accelerated approval will eventually be converted to a traditional approval. Further, the standard of care may change with the approval of new products in the same indications that we are studying. This may result in the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies requesting additional studies to evaluate our product candidate relative to the new products. 
 Our clinical trial results may also not support approval. In addition, our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following: 
 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials; 

we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for any of their proposed indications; 

the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval, including due to the heterogeneity of patient populations; 

we may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates clinical and other benefits outweigh their safety risks; 

66 

the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; 

the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will inspect our manufacturing facility (or our CDMO's facility) and may not find it acceptable; and 

the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. 

We may seek orphan drug designation for some or all of our product candidates across various indications, but we may be unable to obtain such designations or to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market exclusivity, which may cause our revenue, if any, to be reduced. 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. In order to obtain orphan drug designation, the request must be made before submitting a BLA. In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of that particular product for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a BLA, to market the same biologic (meaning, a product with the same principal molecular structural features) for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other biologics that do not have the same principal molecular structural features for use in treating the same indication or disease or the same biologic for a different indication or disease during the exclusivity period. Furthermore, the FDA can waive orphan exclusivity if we are unable to manufacture sufficient supply of our product or if a subsequent applicant demonstrates clinical superiority over our products. 
 We may seek orphan drug designation for some or all of our product candidates in specific orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of these products. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition, or if a subsequent applicant demonstrates clinical superiority over our products, if approved. In addition, although we may seek orphan drug designation for other product candidates, we may never receive such designations. Further, the FDA may further reevaluate its regulations and policies under the Orphan Drug Act. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 
 A fast track designation by the FDA, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. 
 We have received fast track designation for ADI-001 for the treatment of LN and for ADI-270 in metastatic/advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma. If a drug or biologic is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product candidate demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the product candidate sponsor may apply for fast track designation for a particular indication. We may seek fast track designation for certain of our product candidates, but there is no assurance that the FDA will grant this status to any of our product candidates. Marketing applications filed by sponsors of product candidate with fast track designation may qualify for priority review under the policies and procedures offered by the FDA, but the fast track designation does not assure any such qualification or ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant fast track designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, there can be no assurance that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared 
 67 

to conventional FDA procedures, and receiving a fast track designation does not provide assurance of ultimate FDA approval. In addition, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. In addition, the FDA may withdraw any fast track designation at any time. 
 Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. 
 We may seek RMAT designation for one or more of our product candidates. In 2017, the FDA established the RMAT designation to expedite review of a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain RMAT designation for any of our product candidates. RMAT designation does not change the FDA s standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that such designation will result in expedited review or approval or that the approved indication will not be narrower than the indication covered by the designation. Additionally, RMAT designation can be revoked if the criteria for eligibility cease to be met as clinical data emerges. 
 Positive results from early preclinical studies and clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results of any future clinical trials of our product candidates, and may change as more patient data becomes available and is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. If we cannot replicate the positive results from our earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates in our future clinical trials, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidate. 
 From time to time, we may publish interim, top-line or preliminary results from our preclinical studies or clinical trials. Such clinical results are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line results also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. Preliminary or top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously announced. As a result, interim, top-line, and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. It is also difficult to predict the timing of announcing interim results. 
 Accordingly, any positive results from our preclinical studies and ongoing and future clinical trials of our product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results from required later clinical trials. Similarly, even if we are able to complete our planned preclinical studies or any future clinical trials according to our current development timeline, the positive results from such preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in subsequent preclinical studies or clinical trial results. 
 Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway, or safety or efficacy observations made in preclinical studies and clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product candidate performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or similar regulatory approval. 
 Additionally, our ongoing clinical trial utilizes an open-label trial design, as may be the case in planned future clinical trials. An open-label clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a patient bias where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials 
 68 

may be subject to an investigator bias where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with any of our product candidates when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control. 
 If the clinical updates, or the interim, "top-line", or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our product candidates, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition may be harmed. 
 Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions. 
 Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval. 
 We may also submit marketing applications in other countries. Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed. 
 Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU, or Brexit, and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently aligns in the most part with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, which became effective in the EU on January 31, 2022 and provides for a streamlined clinical trial application and assessment procedure covering multiple EU Member States, has not been implemented into UK law, and a separate application will need to be submitted for clinical trial authorization in the UK. The separate, and potentially diverging, regulatory regimes between Great Britain and the EU may increase our regulatory burden of applying for and obtaining authorization in Great Britain and the EU. 
 Even if we receive regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates. 
 Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates will require post-market surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and record keeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are required to register establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and will be subject to continual review and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies to assess compliance with cGMPs and adherence to 
 69 

commitments made in any BLA, other marketing application and previous responses to inspectional observations. Manufacturers and manufacturers facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations and applicable product tracking and tracing requirements. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription product candidates must also notify the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. In addition, the FDA could require us to conduct another study to obtain additional safety or biomarker information. 
 Further, even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We will also be required to comply with FDA's promotion and advertising rules, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product s approved uses (known as off-label use ), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet and social media. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the FDA does restrict manufacturers' communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party suppliers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our product candidates, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 

fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials; 

refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA s and other regulatory authorities policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
 Even if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, the products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and others in the medical community, adversely affecting our ability to achieve our commercial and financial projections. 
 The use of engineered gamma delta T cells as potential treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer is a recent development and may not become broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and others in the medical community. We expect physicians, including rheumatologists, nephrologists and oncologists, to be particularly important to the market acceptance of our products and we may not be able to educate them on the benefits of using our product candidates for many reasons. Additional factors will influence whether our product candidates are accepted in the market, including: 
 the clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved; 

physicians, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and patients considering our product candidates as a safe and effective treatment; 

the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments; 

the prevalence and severity of any side effects; 

70 

product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities; 

limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the FDA; 

the timing of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products; 

the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments; 

the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities; 

the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities; 

relative convenience and ease of administration, including as compared to alternative treatments and competitive therapies; and 

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. 

If our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers or others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate significant revenue. Even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete. 
 Coverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates, if approved, profitably. 
 Successful sales of our product candidates, if approved, depend on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors including governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations and commercial payors, among others. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In addition, because our product candidates represent new approaches to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer, we cannot accurately estimate the potential revenue from our product candidates. For further discussion on coverage and reimbursement matters, see the section entitled Business Government Regulation and Product Approval Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors is critical to new product acceptance. 
 Third-party payors decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the third-party payor s determination that use of a product is: 
 a covered benefit under its health plan; 

safe, effective and medically necessary; 

appropriate for the specific patient; 

cost-effective; and 

neither experimental nor investigational. 

Obtaining coverage and reimbursement of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, if the resulting reimbursement rates are insufficient, hospitals may not approve our product for use in their facility or third-party payors may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates. Separate reimbursement for the product itself may or may not be available. Instead, the hospital or administering physician may be reimbursed only for providing the treatment or procedure in which our product is used. Further, from time to time, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and Outpatient Prospective Payment System, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government healthcare 
 71 

programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers and reduce the willingness of physicians to use our product candidates. 
 In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, one payor s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Because our product candidate may have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies, and may require long-term follow-up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater. There is significant uncertainty related to insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidate. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures are expected to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures. Specifically, there have been several United States Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes. 
 Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs. Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. 
 We intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the United States and in selected foreign jurisdictions. Increased efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidate. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly those in Europe, the pricing of biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate. Some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. We expect downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing to continue. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 The advancement of healthcare reform may negatively impact our ability to sell our product candidates, if approved, profitably. 
 Third-party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our product candidates, if approved, profitably. For further discussion on healthcare reform matters, see the section entitled Business Government Regulation and Product Approval Healthcare Reform in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. 
 72 

The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical and biologics pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in various congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. 
 We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. Federal Government will pay for healthcare drugs and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect: 
 the demand for our product candidates if we obtain regulatory approval; 

our ability to set a price that it believes is fair for our products; 

our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; 

the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and 

the availability of capital. 

Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
 If our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market. 
 We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and license agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market. 
 Additional patent applications have been filed, and we anticipate additional patent applications will be filed, both in the United States and in other countries, as appropriate. However, we cannot predict: 
 if and when patents will issue; 

the degree and range of protection any issued patents will afford us against competitors including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents; 

whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications; or 

whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose. 

Composition of matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical products such as CAR-based product candidates often provide a strong form of intellectual property protection for those types of products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our pending patent applications covering composition of 
 73 

matter of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of our issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. 
 The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patentability, validity, enforceability or scope thereof, for example through inter partes review (IPR) post-grant review or ex parte reexamination before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, which may result in such patents being cancelled, narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing their products to avoid being covered by our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. United States patent applications containing or that at any time contained a claim not entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013 are subject to the first to file system implemented by the America Invents Act (2011). 
 This first to file system will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that it was the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, for United States applications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third-party or instituted by the USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For United States applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law in view of the passage of the America Invents Act, which brought into effect significant changes to the United States patent laws, including new procedures for challenging patent applications and issued patents. 
 We may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses. 
 We may require access to additional intellectual property to develop our current or future product candidates. Accordingly, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. 
 Our product candidates may also require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, which would harm our business. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. We may need to cease use of the compositions or methods covered by such third-party intellectual property rights. 
 The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. 
 We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. 
 Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of our patents is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee 
 74 

resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. 
 Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. 
 Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. 
 Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 
 Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The lives of our patents may not be sufficient to effectively protect our products and business. 
 Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective filing date. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from biosimilar or generic medications. In addition, although upon issuance in the United States a patient s life can be increased based on certain delays caused by the USPTO, this increase can be reduced or eliminated based on certain delays caused by the patent applicant during patent prosecution. If we do not have sufficient patent life to protect our products, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property. 
 We may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. 
 Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found unpatentable, invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or the USPTO. 
 If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or 
 75 

unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include IPR, ex parte re-examination and post grant review in the United States, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover and protect our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of unpatentability, invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of unpatentability, invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 Risks Related to Third Party Intellectual Property 
 We depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business. 
 We are dependent on patents, know-how and proprietary technology, both our own and licensed from others. We depend substantially on our license agreements with Regeneron. These licenses may be terminated upon certain conditions. Any termination of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates. To the extent these licensors fail to meet their obligations under their license agreements, which we are not in control of, we may lose the benefits of our license agreements with these licensors. In the future, we may also enter into additional license agreements that are material to the development of our product candidates. 
 Disputes may also arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including those related to: 
 the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; 

whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement; 

our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships; 

our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and 

the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners. 

If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed or license in the future, prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. 
 We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license, as we are for intellectual property that we own, which are described below. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize products could suffer. 
 Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. 
 In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Trade secrets, however, may be difficult to protect. Although we require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and require all of our employees and key consultants who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our intellectual property to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 76 

Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our product discovery and development efforts. 
 Our commercial success depends in part on us avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. 
 We are aware of United States and foreign patents held by a third parties relating to gamma delta T cell expansion protocols and related compositions which, on information and belief, are invalid and/or not infringed. In the event that these patents are successfully asserted against our product candidates, such as ADI-001, ADI-270 and ADI-002, or the use of our precursor cells in manufacture of these product candidates, such litigation may negatively impact our ability to commercialize these product candidates in such jurisdictions. We are also aware of several United States and foreign patents held by third parties relating to certain CAR compositions of matter, methods of making and methods of use which, on information and belief, are invalid and/or not infringed. Nevertheless, third parties may assert that we infringe their patents or are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us. Generally, conducting clinical trials and other development activities in the United States is not considered an act of infringement. If and when ADI-001, ADI-270, ADI-002 or another CAR-based product candidate is approved by the FDA, third parties may then seek to enforce their patents by filing a patent infringement lawsuit against us. Patents issued in the United States by law enjoy a presumption of validity that can be rebutted only with evidence that is clear and convincing, a heightened standard of proof. We may not be able to prove in litigation that any patent enforced against us is invalid and/or not infringed. 
 Additionally, there may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our product candidates, constructs or molecules used in or formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held not infringed, unpatentable, invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy or patient selection methods, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held not infringed, unpatentable, invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. 
 Parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties, or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property Laws 
 Changes in United States patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. 
 As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. Recent United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once 
 77 

obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions outside of the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 
 Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that it develops or licenses. 
 We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. 
 We have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 Risks Related to Ownership Generally 
 The trading price of our common stock is highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock. Securities class action or other litigation involving our company or members of our management team could also substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our stock price is highly volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In addition, if the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or the broader stock market continues to experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the purchase price and you may lose some or all of your investment. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: 
 the success of existing or new competitive products or technologies; 

regulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or our competitors products and product candidates; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments; 

the timing and results of clinical trials of ADI-001; 

our ability to obtain FDA clearance of additional INDs for ADI-001 in autoimmune indications; 

78 

the initiation, timing and results of clinical studies of ADI-270; 

commencement or termination of collaborations for our development programs; 

failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs; 

results of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors; 

regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries; 

developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights; 

the recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs; 

the results of our efforts to develop additional product candidates or products; 

issues or delays regarding the manufacturing of our product candidates and, if approved, products by us or by our third-party suppliers; 

actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results or development timelines; 

announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; 

sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or other stockholders; 

variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 

changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, that cover us; 

changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 

market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; 

general economic, industry and market conditions; and 

the other factors described in this Risk Factors section. 

In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for biopharmaceutical companies, which have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to securities litigation related to corporate governance matters determined in good faith by our board of directors, including the stock option repricing in August 2023 in accordance with the terms of our 2015 Plan and 2018 Plan. Even if the allegations against us are unfounded or we ultimately are not held liable, we may experience related negative publicity resulting in damage to our reputation. Further, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements, fines, penalties or judgments against us and may consume management s bandwidth and attention, some or all of which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. If an active trading market is not sustained, our ability to raise capital in the future may be impaired. 
 Our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on January 26, 2018 and now trades on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ACET. Given the limited trading history of our common stock, there is a risk that an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained, which could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock and thereby affect your ability to sell shares you purchased. An inactive trading market for our common stock may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund our operations by selling shares and impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. 
 Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. 
 Our executive officers, directors, and 5 stockholders beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 38.1 of our outstanding voting common stock as of September 30, 2024. Accordingly, these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position and significantly affect the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to significantly affect the outcome of elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or 
 79 

discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. 
 Risks Related to Market Uncertainties 
 Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price. 
 The global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in the past several years, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatile interest rates, rising and fluctuating inflation rates, reduced corporate profitability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the United States. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. In addition, inflation rates in the U.S. have recently increased to levels not seen in decades. 
 We believe that the state of global economic conditions are particularly volatile and uncertain and may negatively impact our ability to conduct clinical trials on the scale and timelines anticipated. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business or political environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make obtaining any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. For example, as a result of political, social, and economic instability abroad, including as a result of armed conflict, war or threat of war, in particular, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including resulting sanctions, terrorist activity and other security concerns in general, there could be a significant disruption of global financial markets, impairing our ability to raise capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive an economic downturn, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. To the extent that our profitability and strategies are negatively affected by downturns or volatility in general economic conditions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 Our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation, interest rates and supply chain constraints. 
 Various macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties such as those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, rising interest rates have impacted our net income. Recent supply chain constraints have led to higher inflation, which, if sustained, could have a negative impact on our product development and operations. If inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, our ability to develop our current pipeline and new therapeutic products may be negatively affected. Current capital market conditions, including the impact of inflation, have increased borrowing rates and can be expected to significantly increase our cost of capital as compared to prior periods and could also affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all, in order to fund our operations. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers to manufacture clinical trial materials for our product candidates. 
 Risks Related to our Charter and Bylaws 
 Anti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 Our restated certificate of incorporation (certificate of incorporation) and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include: 
 a board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time; 

a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 

80 

a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; 

advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors; 

a requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of the holders of not less than 75 of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an annual election of directors; 

a requirement of approval of not less than 75 of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and 

the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. 

In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirors to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
 Our amended and restated bylaws provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. 
 Our amended and restated bylaws specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine (Delaware Forum Provision); provided, however, that the Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. This choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws described above; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, employees and agents as it may limit any stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies bylaws or certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 General Risk Factors 
 We are a Smaller Reporting Company (SRC) and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to SRCs may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 We are considered a SRC under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. We are therefore entitled to rely on certain reduced disclosure requirements, such as an exemption from providing selected financial data and executive compensation information. 
 81 

These exemptions and reduced disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company also mean our auditors are not required to review our internal control over financial reporting and may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our common stock prices may be more volatile. We will remain a smaller reporting company for as long as (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million as of the prior June 30. 
 We have broad discretion over the use of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities and may not use them effectively. 
 Our management has broad discretion to use our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending our use to fund operations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. 
 We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, stockholders must rely on capital appreciation, if any, for any return on their investment. 
 We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently plan to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation, development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. 
 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us issues an adverse opinion about our company, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases research coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. 
 If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. 
 We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the future clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend themselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 
 decreased demand for our product candidates; 

injury to our reputation; 

withdrawal of clinical trial participants; 

initiation of investigations by regulators; 

costs to defend the related litigation; 

a diversion of management s time and our resources; 

substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; 

product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; 

loss of revenue; 

82 

exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and 

the inability to commercialize any product candidate. 

Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop, alone or with corporate collaborators. Our insurance policies may also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. Assuming we obtain clinical trial insurance for our clinical trials, we may have to pay amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceeds our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle it to indemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise. 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall. 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. 
 On March 15, 2022, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-263587) with the SEC, which was amended by the Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as filed with the SEC on March 16, 2022, declared effective on May 9, 2022 (2022 Shelf Registration Statement), in relation to the registration of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units of any combination thereof for the purposes of selling, from time to time, our common stock, debt securities or other equity securities in one or more offerings. Under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement and a prospectus supplement filed on January 22, 2024, on January 25, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 32,379,667 shares of our common stock, which included 5,325,000 shares sold and issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 8,445,333 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of 2.40 per share and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a public offering price of 2.3999 per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share public offering price of each share of common stock minus the 0.0001 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. We received 98.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As a result of this offering, our stockholders experienced significant dilution. If we sell, or the market perceives that we intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement or otherwise, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. 
 We have also filed registration statements on Form S-8 registering the issuance of shares of common stock issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Shares registered under these registration statements on Form S-8 can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements described above. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. 
 In addition, certain of our employees, executive officers, and directors may enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee, director, or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the employee, officer, or director. A Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our employees, executive officers, and directors also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information.
