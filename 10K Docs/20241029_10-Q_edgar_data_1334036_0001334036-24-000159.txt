 Senior Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 In July 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the Borrowers entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. Since that time, we have amended the Credit Agreement, which, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility of million, which can be increased by an additional million subject to certain conditions (the Revolving Facility ). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on (A) a Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus , (ii) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (iii) the Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus ), plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on our leverage ratio or to for the Daily Simple SOFR based on the leverage ratio, or (B) the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on our leverage ratio for one-month interest periods and to based on our leverage ratio for three month interest periods. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires or required, as applicable, us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) to 1.00 from the quarter ended March 31, 2022 through, and including, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, (ii) to 1.00 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, (iii) to 1.00 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and (iv) to 1.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The Credit Agreement permits, among other things, (i) stock repurchases subject to certain restrictions, including after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed certain levels; and (ii) certain acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement of at least million. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Revolving Facility were million. At September 30, 2024, we had million in outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, which matures in November 2027.

 billion. Prior to the February 2024 Amendment, the outstanding balance was million. Among other things, the February 2024 Amendment provided for a new million tranche of term loans (the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans and, such facility, the "Term Loan B Facility"), to refinance the then-outstanding principal balance. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company s and each subsidiary guarantor s assets on a pari passu basis with their obligations arising from the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and is scheduled to mature on February 17, 2029, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, satisfying certain leverage ratios, the Company may, at any time, on one or more occasions, add one or more new classes of term facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the loans of any existing class by requesting one or more incremental term facilities. 
 
 Pursuant to the reduced interest rate margins applicable to the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans, each term loan borrowing which is an alternate base rate borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement), plus . Each term loan borrowing which is a term SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement) plus . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility was fully drawn with remaining borrowing capacity, and we had million in outstanding principal on the Term Loan B Facility, which matures on February 17, 2029. 
 
 The Term Loan B Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, incurrence financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default and other provisions. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement.

Our effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We had unrecognized tax benefits of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and we do not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.

 reportable operating segments: the Crocs Brand and the HEYDUDE Brand. Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. 
 
 Additionally, Enterprise corporate costs include global corporate costs associated with both brands, including legal, information technology, human resources, and finance. 
 
 Each segment s performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating Enterprise corporate expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of unallocated enterprise corporate expenses.

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Business Overview 
 
 Crocs, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the Company, we, us, or our are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for all. We strive to be the world leader in innovative casual footwear for women, men, and children, combining comfort and style with a value that consumers want. 
 
 Known or Anticipated Trends 
 
 Based on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends will continue to impact our operating results: 
 
 We continue to operate in an environment where consumers are feeling the effects of elevated interest rates and inflation, and as a result, they are spending more cautiously. In addition, geopolitical tensions have increased across the globe. We remain focused on making the right decisions for the health of our brands, maintaining tight inventory control, and investing in strategic initiatives to support durable long-term growth. 
 We continue to invest in our strategic pillars, including marketing globally for both brands, China and sandal market penetration for the Crocs Brand, product innovation, and various initiatives supporting our global digital business. Specific to the HEYDUDE Brand, we are focused on building a consistent and profitable growth brand. We continue to invest in marketing and talent in order to increase awareness and relevance. 
 Our liquidity position remains strong with approximately 186.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and 574.2 million in available borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2024. Our total borrowings were 1.42 billion as of September 30, 2024. We repurchased 151.2 million of our common stock during the quarter. 
 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), we present certain information related to our results of operations through constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on reported amounts. 
 
 Management uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the Board, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance and trends. Investors should not consider constant currency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights 
 
 Revenues were 1,062.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 1.6 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to the net effects of: (i) higher unit sales volume in the Crocs Brand, partially offset by lower unit sales volume in the HEYDUDE Brand, which resulted in a net increase in revenues of 33.1 million, or 3.2 ; (ii) lower average selling price on a constant currency basis ASP in the Crocs Brand, partially offset by higher ASP in the HEYDUDE Brand, which decreased revenues by 12.9 million, or 1.2 ; and (iii) net unfavorable changes in exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 3.7 million, or 0.4 . 
 
 The following were significant developments affecting our businesses and capital structure during the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 We grew revenues in the Crocs Brand by 7.4 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Gross margin was 59.6 , an increase of 400 basis points from last year s third quarter. This was primarily due to prior year distribution costs associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, lower product costs, favorable brand mix, and lower freight costs.

 Revenues. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues increased compared to the same period in 2023, driven by higher Crocs Brand revenues, partially offset by lower HEYDUDE Brand revenues. Revenues increased 16.5 million, or 1.6 , from higher volume of 33.1 million, or 3.2 , due to higher volume in the Crocs Brand, partially offset by lower volume in the HEYDUDE Brand. The overall increase was offset in part by lower ASP of 12.9 million, or 1.2 , driven by lower ASP in the Crocs Brand as a result of unfavorable product mix as well as slight net price decreases. This decrease in ASP was partially offset by higher ASP in the HEYDUDE Brand from less discounting and increased pricing as well as favorable channel mix as we grow our retail business. Net unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 3.7 million, or 0.4 , primarily in the Brazilian Real and Korean Won, also decreased revenues. 
 
 Revenues also increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher ASP of 144.9 million, or 4.8 , driven by increased pricing and favorable channel mix in both brands, favorable product mix in the Crocs Brand, and less discounting in the HEYDUDE Brand. This was offset in part by net unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of 23.1 million, or 0.8 , primarily in the Korean Won, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen. Lower volume of 11.7 million, or 0.4 , as a result of lower HEYDUDE Brand volumes, partially offset by higher Crocs Brand volumes, also decreased the overall increase in revenues. 
 
 Gross margin. Gross margin increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 59.6 compared to 55.6 in the same period in 2023. This was primarily driven by prior year distribution costs of approximately 180 basis points associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, lower product costs of 70 basis points, favorable brand mix of 70 basis points, and lower freight costs of 40 basis points. 
 
 Gross margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 59.0 compared to 55.9 in 2023. This was primarily driven by lower freight costs in both brands of approximately 100 basis points, prior year distribution costs of approximately 80 basis points associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, favorable brand mix of 70 basis points, and lower product costs of 50 basis points. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG A increased 55.7 million, or 18.1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by increased investments in talent and marketing of 17.9 million and 14.4 million, respectively. Additionally, there were various other net cost increases, including incremental costs in our DTC channel, of 23.4 million. 
 
 SG A expenses increased 163.3 million, or 19.2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by increased investments in talent and marketing of 55.1 million and 40.9 million, respectively, as well as incremental costs in our DTC channel of 27.2 million. The increase in SG A expenses was also due to an 18.2

 million impairment charge for information technology systems related to the HEYDUDE integration and impairment charges of 5.9 million related to our former warehouses in Las Vegas, Nevada and the Netherlands. Other net costs increased SG A by 16.0 million. 
 
 Foreign currency losses, net. Foreign currency losses, net, consist of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of 0.3 million compared to losses of 1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of 3.9 million compared to losses of 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense. Interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 13.0 million, or 33.2 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 39.0 million, or 31.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower outstanding borrowings and lower weighted average interest rates on the Term Loan B Facility (as defined herein) in the current year. 

Income tax expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense decreased 11.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.4 compared to an effective tax rate of 24.2 for the same period in 2023, a 5.8 decrease. This decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a shift in the mix of the Company's domestic and foreign earnings. Our effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense decreased 9.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.0 compared to an effective tax rate of 23.3 for the same period in 2023, a 2.3 decrease. This decrease in the effective rate was primarily driven by a shift in the mix of the Company s domestic and foreign earnings. Our effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, to reflect changes in the way management evaluates performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we updated our reportable operating segments to be (i) Crocs Brand and (ii) HEYDUDE Brand. Our North America, Asia Pacific, and EMEALA segments as well as revenues and expenses related to Crocs Brand corporate have been consolidated to the Crocs Brand. As a result of these changes, the previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been recast to conform to current period presentation. 
 (3) In the first quarter of 2024, to reflect a change in the way management evaluates segment performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we made changes to segment profitability related to certain foreign currency amounts impacting cost of sales. These amounts have shifted costs or benefits that were previously presented in each of our reportable segments to Enterprise corporate. We believe that the impact of these changes on prior periods is insignificant to each segment and thus have not recast prior periods.

 HEYDUDE Brand

As of September 30, 2023, we had 11 company-operated retail locations for the HEYDUDE Brand, all of which were temporary clearance stores. 

Direct-to-consumer DTC comparable sales were as follows:

 (1) Reflects period over period change on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for more information. 
 (2) Comparable store status, as included in the DTC comparable sales figures above, is determined on a monthly basis. Comparable store sales include the revenues of stores that have been in operation for more than twelve months. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15 as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth month in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure and in the same month in the following year. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce comparable revenues are based on same site sales period over period. E-commerce sites that are temporarily offline or unable to transact or fulfill orders site disruption are excluded from the comparable sales calculation during the month of site disruption and in the same month in the following year. E-commerce site disruptions in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month after the site has re-opened. Additionally, comparable sales do not include leap days in leap years. 

Financial Condition, Capital Resources, and Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 was: 
 September 30, 2024 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 186,122 Available borrowings 574,182 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 186.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to 574.2 million of available borrowings, including 559.2 million of remaining borrowing availability under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) and 15.0 million of remaining borrowing availability under the Citibank Facility (as defined below). As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) was fully drawn and there was no available borrowing capacity. We believe that cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, the success of our operations, global economic conditions, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, among other things, could each impact our business and liquidity.

 Repatriation of Cash 
 
 As a global business, we have cash balances in various countries and amounts are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities. 
 
 All of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. as of September 30, 2024 without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. or other countries and could adversely affect our liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we held 132.6 million of our total 186.1 million in cash in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Of the 132.6 million, 2.4 million could potentially be restricted by local laws. 

Senior Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 In July 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the Borrowers entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. Since that time, we have amended the Credit Agreement, which, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility of 750.0 million, which can be increased by an additional 250.0 million subject to certain conditions (the Revolving Facility ). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on (A) a Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 0.25 , (ii) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (iii) the Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 1.00 ), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25 to 0.875 based on our leverage ratio or 1.35 to 1.975 for the Daily Simple SOFR based on the leverage ratio, or (B) the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.35 to 1.975 based on our leverage ratio for one-month interest periods and 1.40 to 2.025 based on our leverage ratio for three month interest periods. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires or required, as applicable, us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) 4.00 to 1.00 from the quarter ended March 31, 2022 through, and including, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, (ii) 3.75 to 1.00 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, (iii) 3.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and (iv) 3.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The Credit Agreement permits, among other things, (i) stock repurchases subject to certain restrictions, including after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed certain levels; and (ii) certain acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement of at least 40.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Revolving Facility were 750.0 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 190.0 million in outstanding borrowings and 0.8 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 559.2 million and 558.7 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, which matures in November 2027. 
 
 Term Loan B Facility 
 
 On February 17, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender, to among other things, finance a portion of the cash consideration for the HEYDUDE acquisition, which was amended on August 8, 2023 (the August 2023 Amendment and on February 13, 2024 (the February 2024 Amendment ). The Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement, as amended by the August 2023 Amendment and the February 2024 Amendment is referred to herein as the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement provided for an aggregate term loan B facility in the principal amount of 2.0 billion. Prior to the February 2024 Amendment, the outstanding balance was 820.0 million. Among other things, the February 2024 Amendment provided for a new 820.0 million tranche of term loans (the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans and, such facility, the "Term Loan B Facility"), to refinance the then-outstanding principal balance. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company s and each subsidiary guarantor s assets on a pari passu basis with their obligations arising from the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and is scheduled to mature on February 17, 2029, subject to certain 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 exceptions set forth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, satisfying certain leverage ratios, the Company may, at any time, on one or more occasions, add one or more new classes of term facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the loans of any existing class by requesting one or more incremental term facilities. 
 
 Pursuant to the reduced interest rate margins applicable to the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans, each term loan borrowing which is an alternate base rate borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement), plus 1.25 . Each term loan borrowing which is a term SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement) plus 2.25 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility was fully drawn with no remaining borrowing capacity, and we had 575.0 million in outstanding principal on the Term Loan B Facility, which matures on February 17, 2029. 
 
 The Term Loan B Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, incurrence financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default and other provisions. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. 
 
 Asia Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had one revolving credit facility in Asia with Citibank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the Citibank Facility ), which, as amended, provides up to an equivalent of 15.0 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on the Citibank Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding of 3.3 million on the Citibank Facility. 
 
 Senior Notes Issuances 
 
 In March 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250 Senior Notes due March 15, 2029 (the 2029 Notes ), pursuant to the indenture related thereto (as amended and/or supplemented to date, the 2029 Notes Indenture ). Additionally, in August 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125 Senior Notes due August 15, 2031 (the 2031 Notes ), pursuant to the indenture related thereto (as amended and/or supplemented to date, the 2031 Notes Indenture and, together with the 2029 Notes Indenture, the Indentures and, each, an Indenture ). Interest on each of the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes (collectively, the Notes is payable semi-annually. 
 
 The Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2029 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after March 15, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company also had the option to redeem some or all of the 2029 Notes at any time before March 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time before March 15, 2024, the Company could have redeemed up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes at a redemption price of 104.250 of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity issuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 
 
 The Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2031 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after August 15, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

In addition, at any time before August 15, 2024, the Company could have redeemed up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes at a redemption price of 104.125 of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity issuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 
 
 The Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company s existing and future senior debt, including the Credit Agreement, and are senior in right of payment to any of the Company s future debt that is, by its term, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company s restricted subsidiaries

 that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement and by each of the Company s wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantees any debt of the Company or any guarantor under any syndicated credit facility or capital markets debt in an aggregate principal amount in excess of 25.0 million. 
 
 The Indentures contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments; declare or pay dividends or other payments; incur liens; enter into certain types of transactions with the Company s affiliates; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies.

 36,448 (63,856) 100,304 157.1 
 
 Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased 89.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items, of 102.5 million, partially offset by decreases in operating assets and liabilities of 12.7 million, primarily due to the change in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. 
 
 Investing Activities. There was a 35.6 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was due to a decrease in purchases of property, equipment, and software. 
 
 Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities increased by 25.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from borrowings of 136.5 million and an increase of 176.2 million in repurchases of common stock. The overall increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in repayments of borrowings of 277.3 million, a decrease of 8.8 million in repurchases of common stock for tax withholding, a decrease of 0.6 million in deferred debt issuance costs, and other decreases in cash used of 0.2 million.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
 
 For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no other significant changes in our critical accounting policies or their application since December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences, and overall financing strategies. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our Revolving Facility and certain financial instruments. 
 
 Borrowings under our Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Facility bear interest at a variable rate and are therefore subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. Interest rates fluctuate as a result of many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowings with a face value of 1,465.0 million, comprised of the Notes, which carry a fixed rate, the Term Loan B Facility, and borrowings under our Revolving Facility. We also had 0.8 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had long-term borrowings with a face value of 1,713.3 million and 1.3 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Revolving Facility. 
 
 A hypothetical increase of 1 in the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings under our Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Facility would increase our interest expense over the next twelve months by 7.7 million based on the balances outstanding for these borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 Changes in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported U.S. Dollar condensed consolidated financial statements because we translate the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars using current period exchange rates. Specifically, we translate the statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency using exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. As a result, comparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly due to differences in the exchange rates in effect at the time such exchange rates are used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries. 
 
 An increase of 1 of the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies when translating our financial results would have decreased our revenues and income before taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 4.1 million and 0.7 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1 of the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our revenues and income before taxes by 12.8 million and 2.6 million, respectively. This analysis does not account for transactional fluctuations in accounts, such as those driven by purchasing power, which is defined as purchasing foreign goods in the U.S. Dollar but recognizing the cost in foreign currencies. The volatility of the exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. 
 
 In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell various foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period that the changes occur or in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings for derivatives classified as non-hedged or hedged, respectively, as defined in Note 6 Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Dollar notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts was approximately 226.6 million. The fair value of these contracts at September 30, 2024 was an insignificant liability. 
 
 We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of changes in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of September 30, 2024, a 10 appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a net decrease in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately 1.1 million. 
 
 See Part I - Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates on our U.S. Dollar condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such item is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The changes included the implementation of information technology systems related to HEYDUDE, which resulted in additions and changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Except as described herein, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting.

The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and future repurchases will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, liquidity needs, restrictions under our debt arrangements, and other factors. Share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
