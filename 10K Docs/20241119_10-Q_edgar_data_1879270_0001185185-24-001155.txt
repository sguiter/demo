Notes To the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

For The Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024

of the common stock of Atlanta CBD, Inc. Atlanta CDB ), (the Atlanta CBD Acquisition ). Atlanta CBD, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Georgia on October 17, 2018. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiary Atlanta CBD. At the time of the Atlanta CBD Acquisition, Floretta Gogo and Xavier Carter owned the majority of Atlanta CBD and controlled the voting rights. Ms. Gogo and Mr. Carter also controlled of The Cannaisseur Group s voting rights and were the CEO and COO, respectively, of both Companies both before and after the transaction. Pursuant to the guidance of ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ASC 250 the acquisition of Atlanta CBD by The Cannaisseur Group resulted in a change in the reporting entity of the combined companies. The Company relied upon the guidance of ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 in the presentation of the combined entities. Pursuant to ASC 805-50-05-5, the pooling-of-interests method of accounting provides relevant guidance when an exchange of shares between entities under common control results in a change in the reporting entity. Under the pooling-of-interests method, the transferred assets and liabilities are recorded at their historical carrying amounts, and the equity accounts of the separate entities are combined. Pursuant to ASC 805-50-45-2, the transaction should be presented as if it occurred on the first day of the period reported; accordingly, we have reported the Atlanta CBD transaction as if it occurred on January 1, 2020. 

Business Operations 

Currently, the Company sells its products online only, and no longer operates a physical retail store. The Company may reopen a physical store or stores in the future if it is advantageous to its operations. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a cumulative net loss since inception of , a working capital deficit of , and has required additional capital raises to support its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to create positive cash flows from operations and its ability to continue receiving capital from shareholders and other related parties and obtain financing from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. 

As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the accompanying financial statements are issued. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan, and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company's ongoing cash requirements, the Company would be required to obtain funds, if available, although there can be no certainty, from its shareholders or officers.

The increase in liabilities is mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and long-term notes payable. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities of 98,158 resulted from a net loss of 1,181,918, adjustments for share-based compensation of 1,042,000 and a net increase of 41,760 in the components of working capital. The change in the components of working capital was due primarily to an increase in accounts payable, a decrease in inventory, and a decrease in settlement payable, with the remaining change attributable to normal operational fluctuations in current assets and current liabilities. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities of 93,247 resulted from a net loss of 130,973, adjustments for non-cash items totaling 17,685 and a net increase of 20,041 in the components of working capital. The non-cash adjustments to net income are attributable to charges of 2,200 for depreciation and 15,485 for amortization of right to use asset. The change in the components of working capital was due primarily to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 39,960 and a decrease in right of use liability of 17,124, with the remaining change attributable to normal operational fluctuations in current assets and current liabilities. 

Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 

Our financing activities consisted primarily of the sale of common stock, borrowings and repayments of debt, and contributed capital from related parties. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 60,300 consisting of 46,000 in proceeds from convertible notes payable, 7,300 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, and contributed capital by related parties of 7,000. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities of 76,392 consisting of 62,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, 9,378 in proceeds from short term loans offset by repayments of 4,518, contributed capital by related parties of 10,482 and repayments of related party debt of 950. 

General 

Historically, we have financed the Company through a combination of debt and equity transactions. To meet future capital requirements, we plan to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt-financing arrangements, to the extent our operating cash flow is insufficient to fund our operations in future periods. 

The sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our planned activities and limit our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

TCG expects to raise funds through private investors and investment firms and is looking to secure a non-recourse loan for work capital and operating expenses. We intend to continue offering smaller investment opportunities. Long term, we plan to seek larger amounts of investment to expand our operations. TCG will also look to attain a non-recourse loan of 50,000.

There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if our operating performance during the next 12 months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected. We continue to monitor macro-economic factors such as inflationary pressures, continued Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and recessionary fears, as well as trends within our industry, all of which may affect our working capital requirements. 

Inflation 

The amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 1,181,918, net cash used in operating activities of 98,158, negative working capital of 106,986, an accumulated deficit of 1,624,543 and stockholders deficit of 256,487. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of this filing. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations in the future. Management plans to provide for the Company s capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity and debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Registration Statement. Of these policies, we believe that the following items are the most critical in preparing our financial statements. 

Consolidation Policy 

TCG relied upon the guidance of ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ASC 250 and ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 in accounting for and presenting acquisition of Atlanta CBD. Pursuant to ASC 805-50-05-5, the pooling-of-interests method of accounting provides relevant guidance when an exchange of shares between entities under common control results in a change in the reporting entity. Under the pooling-of-interests method, the transferred assets and liabilities are recorded at their historical carrying amounts, and the equity accounts of the separate entities are combined. Pursuant to ASC 805-50-45-2, the transaction should be presented as if it occurred on the first day of the period reported; accordingly, we have reported the Atlanta CBD transaction as if it occurred on January 1, 2020. 

Inventory 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Atlanta CBD periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs or write-offs of inventory based on its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of goods sold. Inventory is based upon the average cost method of accounting.

Table of Contents 

Revenue Recognition 

TCG recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers . ASC Topic 606 requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Atlanta CBD sells CBD related products in a retail location in Atlanta, Georgia and through e-commerce. Revenue is recognized based on the following model: 

1. Atlanta CBD sells products at their one retail location and via web site sales. A sale agreement exists when the customer purchases the product at the counter or via an online purchase. The price for and product to be received are known at time of purchase. 

2. The performance obligations are to provide the product for the customer at the counter or ship the product to the customer. The product is shipped on the day of sale. 

3. The price of the product is located on the label or presented on the web site and therefore is known at the time of purchase. 

4. The price of the product is properly allocated to the sole performance of providing the product. 

5. Revenue is recognized in the retail location at the point of sale where money is collected and the product is in control of customer and from the web site upon settlement of the credit card transaction, which is effectively at the time of purchase. 

Use of Estimates 

Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses.

(as such share classes are defined in the Governing Documents of the Company), at a conversion price (the " Conversion Price ") equal to the lesser of the following: (i) 80 of the lowest price per share paid by the investors purchasing Equity Securities in the Qualified Financing (such percentage, the " Conversion Discount "); or (ii) the number equal to (A) 3,500,000 (such number, the " Valuation Cap ") divided by (B) the number of shares of the Company outstanding (calculated on a fully-diluted basis assuming full exercise of all outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock of the Company and full conversion of all securities convertible into Equity Securities) immediately prior to the conversion, and excluding the shares reserved or authorized for issuance under the Company's then-existing stock option plan, if any (the Company's " Outstanding Shares "). The resulting number of shares issued to the Investor will be equal to the Outstanding Debt divided by the Conversion Price. 

Upon such conversion of this Note, the Investor hereby agrees to execute and deliver to the Company any and all transaction documents related to the Qualified Financing, including a purchase agreement and other ancillary agreements, with customary representations and warranties and transfer restrictions (including a 180-day lock-up agreement in connection with an initial public offering), and having the same terms as those agreements entered into by the investors purchasing Equity Securities in the Qualified Financing, and the Investor shall receive the same rights as all other investors purchasing Equity Securities in the Qualified Financing, except as it relates to (i) the voting rights of the Equity Securities, which will exclusively be available to Major Purchasers, (ii) any board representation and observer rights may vary among holders of the Company's Equity Securities and will be as set forth in the applicable transaction documents, and (iii) any rights the Investor may otherwise agree to. The Investor and Administrative Agent also agree to deliver the original of this Note (or a notice to the effect that the original Note has been lost, stolen or destroyed and an agreement acceptable to the Company whereby the Investor agrees to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with this Note) at the closing of the Qualified Financing for cancellation; provided, however, that upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 7.1 , this Note shall be deemed converted and of no further force and effect, whether or not it is delivered for cancellation as set forth in this sentence. 

7.2. Optional Conversion . If the Notes have not been converted to Equity Securities of the Company prior to the Maturity Date, then, at any time after the Maturity Date until repayment thereof, the Notes may be converted upon the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Majority Investors into Equity Securities of the Company on such terms as agreed upon by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Majority Investors at the time of the conversion, with the number of shares of Equity Securities being issued to the Investor equal to the Outstanding Debt divided by the conversion price, with such conversion price calculated as (A) the Valuation Cap divided by (B) the number of the Company's Outstanding Shares (an " Optional Conversion "). 

7.3. Fractional Equity Securities; Interest; Effect of Conversion . No fractional Equity Securities shall be issued upon conversion of this Note. In lieu of the Company issuing any fractional Equity Securities to the Investor upon the conversion of this Note, the Company shall in its sole discretion either pay to the Investor an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the conversion price by the fraction of an Equity Security not issued pursuant to the previous sentence or issue to the Note an additional Equity Security. In addition, the Company shall pay to the Investor any interest accrued on the amount to be paid to the Company pursuant to the previous sentence. Upon conversion of this Note in full and the payment of any amounts specified in this Section 7.3 , the Company shall be forever released from all its obligations and liabilities under this Note. 

Section 8. Events of Default; Remedies. 

8.1. Events of Default Defined . Each of the following events constitutes an " Event of Default " for purposes of this Note: 

(a) if any one (1) payment of principal and/or interest due to the Investor is not paid by the Company on 

Convertible Note Agreement 

Page 4 of 12

or prior to the due date, as defined in this Note, and the non-payment continues for a period of ten (10) Business Days thereafter; 

(b) an involuntary proceeding has been commenced or an involuntary petition has been filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or other relief in respect of the Company or any of its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets, under any federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for the Company or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition has continued undismissed for sixty (60) days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing has been entered; 

(c) the Company has (i) voluntarily commenced any proceeding or filed any petition seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief under any federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, (ii) consent to the institution of, or fail to contest in a timely and appropriate manner, any proceeding or petition described in clause (c) immediately above, (iii) apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for the Company or for a substantial part of its assets, (iv) file an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any such proceeding, (v) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (vi) take any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; 

(d) If any representation or warranty made in this Note by the Company shall be materially incorrect when made or deemed made. 

8.2. Rights and Remedies . 

(a) If an Event of Default occurs under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(d) and is continuing, then this Note will forthwith mature and an amount equal to the Outstanding Debt shall, at the option of the Investor (as communicated by the Investor or the Administrative Agent on its behalf) and, in the case of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c) , automatically, become immediately due and payable by the Company to the Investor. 

(b) The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from an Investor or the Company referring to this Note, describing such Event of Default and stating that such notice is a " Notice of Default ". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to all Investors in the Notes and the Company. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Investor; provided, however, that unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Investors in the Notes except to the extent that this Note expressly requires that such action be taken, or not taken, only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Investor, as the case may be. 

(c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to the Investor against the Company under this Note or at law or in equity may be exercised by the Administrative Agent, at the request of Investor, and may be exercised, with the consent of the Investor, at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Outstanding Debt shall be declared due and payable. Any such actions taken by the Administrative Agent shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent permitted by applicable law, equity or contract or as set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that 

Convertible Note Agreement 

Page 5 of 12

all rights, remedies or privileges provided to the Administrative Agent shall remain in full force and effect until the Administrative Agent has exhausted all of its remedies and this Note has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the obligations herein or the Outstanding Debt has been paid in full. A waiver of one or more Events of Default with respect to the Company shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Event of Default by the Company or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon. 

Section 9. Unsecured Obligations of the Company; Subordination. 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the obligations of the Company to the Investor under this Note shall be unsecured obligations of the Company, which carry no voting rights as it relates to the operations of the Company. The obligations in this Note are the corporate obligation of the Company only and no recourse shall be had against any past, present or future shareholder or officer of the Company directly. 

The rights and indebtedness evidenced by this Note are subordinated and junior in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner enforceable by Federal and applicable state laws, to all indebtedness owed by the Company to the " Senior Creditors " of the Company, as such term is defined in Section 1 whether now existing or hereinafter arising, plus all interest, expenses, and related fees related thereto (such indebtedness, hereinafter referred to as the " Senior Debt "). If at any point in the future, non-senior, unsecured debt financing is obtained by the Company, this Note shall be senior in its position among all unsecured creditors. 

Upon the Administrative Agent's receipt of notice from a Senior Creditor of a default by the Company under the Senior Debt, the Company shall stop making payments under this Note and the Administrative Agent shall stop accepting such payments. Any payments received by the Administrative Agent and/or the Investor after receipt of such notice shall be held in trust by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Senior Creditor(s) and shall be immediately paid over to Senior Creditor(s), or its designated representative, for application to the payment of the Senior Debt, until all the Senior Debt is paid in full. 

Upon request by the Company, or Senior Creditor(s) and provided that no unexcused default shall have occurred under this Note, the Investor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into a mutually-acceptable and commercially reasonable subordination agreement with any Senior Creditor, on behalf of the Investors in the Notes, subordinating the Company's obligations to the Investors to the extent and in the manner set forth in the paragraph above up to the lesser of (a) the principal amount of the indebtedness to such Senior Creditor, or (b) the Outstanding Debt. 

If there shall occur any receivership, insolvency, assignment for the benefit of creditors, bankruptcy, reorganization, or arrangements with creditors (whether or not pursuant to bankruptcy or other insolvency laws), sale of all or substantially all of the assets, dissolution, liquidation, or any other marshaling of the assets and liabilities of Company, (i) no amount shall be paid by the Company to the Investor unless and until the principal amount of the Senior Debt has been paid in full, and (ii) no claim or proof of claim shall be filed with the Company by or on behalf of the Investors in the Notes which shall assert any right to receive any payments except subject to the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all of the Senior Debt then outstanding. 

Subject to the foregoing paragraphs, nothing contained in this Section 9 shall impair, as between the Company and the Investor, the obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to pay to the Investor the payments of principal and interest as and when the same become due and payable, or shall prevent the Investor and the Administrative Agent, upon default hereunder, from exercising all rights, powers and remedies otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. 

Section 10. Representations and Warranties of the Company. 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Investor as of the date the 

Convertible Note Agreement 

Page 6 of 12

(d) Compliance with Other Instruments . The Company is not in violation or default of any term of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or of any provision of any mortgage, indenture or contract to which it is a party and by which it is bound or of any judgment, decree, order or writ. The execution, delivery and performance of this Note will not result in any such violation or be in conflict with, or constitute, with or without the passage of time and giving of notice, either a default under any such provision, instrument, judgment, decree, order or writ or an event that results in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets of the Company or the suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture, or nonrenewal of any material permit, license, authorization or approval applicable to the Company, its business or operations or any of its assets or properties. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company has obtained all waivers reasonably necessary with respect to any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights, including any notice or offering periods provided for as part of any such rights, in order for the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder without any third party obtaining any rights to cause the Company to offer or issue any securities of the Company as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder. 

Section 11. Miscellaneous.

Page 7 of 12

or reproduce any of the Confidential Information.

Because the Administrative Agent operates principally on the Internet, the Investor will need to consent to transact business with the Administrative Agent online and electronically. As part of doing business with the Administrative Agent, therefore, the Company also needs the Investor to consent to the Company giving the Investor certain disclosures electronically, either via the Company Offering Profile or to the email address the Investor provides to the Company.
