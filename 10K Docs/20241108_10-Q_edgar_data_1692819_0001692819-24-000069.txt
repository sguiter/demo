 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that are included in this report, or made in presentations, in response to questions or otherwise, that address activities, events or developments that may occur in the future, including (without limitation) such matters as activities related to our financial or operational projections, including potential nuclear PTCs, capital allocation, capital expenditures, liquidity, dividend policy, business strategy, competitive strengths, goals, future acquisitions or dispositions, development or operation of power generation assets, market and industry developments and the growth of our businesses and operations, including potential transactions with large load facilities at our nuclear and gas plants (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as "intends," "plans," "potential," "will likely," "unlikely," "believe," "expect," "anticipated," "estimate," "should," "could," "may," "projection," "forecast," "target," "goal," "objective" and "outlook"), are forward-looking statements. Although we believe that in making any such forward-looking statement our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such forward-looking statement involves uncertainties and risks and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the discussion in (i) Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K and (ii) in Part I, Item 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in or implied by such forward-looking statements. 
 
 Any forward-looking statement speaks only at the date on which it is made, and except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict them. In addition, we may be unable to assess the impact of any such event or condition or the extent to which any such event or condition, or combination of events or conditions, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statement. As such, you should not unduly rely on such forward-looking statements.

Recent Developments 
 
 Nuclear PTCs 
 
 The IRA introduced a PTC for nuclear energy under Internal Revenue Code Section 45U that is available to existing nuclear units from 2024 through 2032. All our nuclear units qualify for this credit, which is based on the amount of electricity sold during the taxable year and is subject to a phase-out based on annual gross receipts. While we believe we meet the conditions for earning the nuclear PTC, we are awaiting guidance from the U.S. Treasury and IRS on the implementation of IRC Section 45U, particularly on the definition of gross receipts including the treatment of hedges, among other key components to industry interpretations of the definition. The forthcoming guidance could have a significant impact on our estimate of PTC revenues. The amount of nuclear PTCs recorded could have a material impact on our 2024 financial statements. 
 
 Tax Credit Transfer Agreement 
 
 In October 2024, we sold million of transferable ITCs we recognized as a result of the Moss Landing Phase III site reaching commercial operations in June 2023, as well as million and million of PTCs generated at our Emerald Grove and Brightside solar facilities in 2023, respectively. Vistra received cash consideration from the sale in October 2024. 
 
 Debt and Financing Activity 
 
 See Note 9 for information on amendments to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commodity-Linked Facility in October 2024. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In October 2024, the Board authorized billion for additional repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program (see Note 15).

 equity interest of Vistra Vision (collectively, Energy Harbor Merger). The Energy Harbor Merger combines Energy Harbor's and Vistra's nuclear and retail businesses and certain Vistra Zero renewables and energy storage facilities to provide diversification and scale across multiple carbon-free technologies (dispatchable and renewables/storage) and the retail business. 
 
 The Energy Harbor Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), which requires identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their estimated fair values on the Merger Date. The combined results of operations are reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements beginning as of the Merger Date.

 As a result of the Energy Harbor Merger, Vistra maintained an ownership interest in Vistra Vision and recorded the remaining equity interest as a noncontrolling interest in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of the Merger Date.

 Acquisition of Non-Controlling Interest 
 
 On September 18, 2024 (the UPA Transaction Date), Vistra Operations and Vistra Vision Holdings I LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Vistra Operations (Vistra Vision Holdings), entered into separate Unit Purchase Agreements (the UPAs) with each of Nuveen and Avenue, pursuant to which Vistra Vision Holdings has agreed to purchase each of Nuveen's and Avenue's combined noncontrolling interest in Vistra Vision for billion in cash, not including the adjustment for dividends of million (collectively, the Transaction). If Nuveen and Avenue receive less than million in dividend distributions from Vistra Vision for the remainder of 2024, then the purchase price payable on the Closing Date will be adjusted upward by the difference, and if they receive distributions in excess of million, then the purchase price payable at the Closing Date will be adjusted downward by the difference. Total scheduled payments under the UPAs are billion. The Transaction is expected to close on December 31, 2024 (the Closing Date), subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, at which time Vistra Vision Holdings will own of the equity interests in Vistra Vision.

 Final Section 163(j) Regulations 
 
 The final Section 163(j) regulations, which limits qualified deductions for business interest expense, were issued in July 2020 and provided a critical correction to the proposed regulations regarding the computation of adjusted taxable income. As of January 1, 2022, certain provisions in the final Section 163(j) regulations have sunset, including the add-back of depreciation and amortization to adjusted taxable income. As a result, under the law as currently enacted, Vistra's deductible business interest expense was significantly limited for the 2023 tax year and will continue to be so limited under current law going forward. Vistra remains active in legislative monitoring and advocacy efforts to support a legislative solution to reinstate and make permanent the add-back of depreciation and amortization to adjusted taxable income.

 Vistra Operations Credit Facilities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities consisted of up to billion in senior secured, first-lien revolving credit commitments and outstanding term loans, which consisted of revolving credit commitments of up to billion (Revolving Credit Facility), including aggregate revolving letter of credit commitments of up to billion, and term loans of billion (Term Loan B-3 Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. In October 2024, Vistra Operations amended the Revolving Credit Facility which, among other things, increased revolving credit commitments to billion and extended the maturity date to October 11, 2029. 
 
 Under the Vistra Operations Credit Agreement, (i) the interest applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility is based on the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR (Term SOFR Rate) plus a spread that will range from to and (ii) the fee on any undrawn amounts with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility will range from basis points to basis points. Letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest that ranges from to . Interest and fees on the Revolving Credit Facility are based on ratings of Vistra Operations' senior secured long-term debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, after taking into account sustainability pricing adjustments based on certain sustainability-linked targets and thresholds, the applicable interest rate margins for the Revolving Credit Facility and the fee for undrawn amounts relating to such commitments were and basis points, respectively, and the applicable interest rate margin for the letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit facility was . The Vistra Operations Credit Facilities also provide for certain additional customary fees payable to the agents and lenders, including fronting fees with respect to outstanding letters of credit.

 The Vistra Operations Credit Facilities also permit certain hedging agreements and cash management agreements to be secured on a pari-passu basis with the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities in the event those hedging agreements and cash management agreements meet certain criteria set forth in the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities. 
 
 The Vistra Operations Credit Facilities provide for affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Vistra Operations (and its restricted subsidiaries), including affirmative covenants requiring it to provide financial and other information to the agents under the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities and to not change its lines of business, and negative covenants restricting Vistra Operations' (and its restricted subsidiaries') ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, pay dividends, grant liens or take certain other actions, in each case, except as permitted in the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities. Vistra Operations' ability to borrow under the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent set forth therein. 
 
 The Vistra Operations Credit Facilities provide for certain customary events of default, including events of default resulting from non-payment of principal, interest or fees when due, material breaches of representations and warranties, material breaches of covenants in the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities or ancillary loan documents, cross-defaults under other agreements or instruments and the entry of material judgments against Vistra Operations. Solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, and solely during a compliance period (which, for periods prior to the October 2024 amendment, was applicable when the aggregate revolving borrowings and issued revolving letters of credit (in excess of million) exceeded of the revolving commitments), the agreement includes a covenant that requires the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio, which is based on the ratio of net first lien debt compared to an EBITDA calculation defined under the terms of the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, not to exceed to 1.00 (or, during a collateral suspension period, the consolidated total net leverage ratio, which is based on the ratio of consolidated total debt compared to an EBITDA calculation defined under the terms of the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, not to exceed to 1.00). Upon the existence of an event of default, the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities provide that all principal, interest and other amounts due thereunder will become immediately due and payable, either automatically or at the election of specified lenders. 
 
 Vistra Operations Commodity-Linked Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Vistra Operations senior secured commodity-linked revolving credit facility (Commodity-Linked Facility) totaled billion of aggregate available commitments. We have the flexibility, subject to our ability to obtain additional commitments, to further increase the size of the Commodity-Linked Facility to billion. The Commodity-Linked Facility is used to support our hedging strategy. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base of million is lower than the facility limit which represents the aggregate commitments of billion. In October 2024, Vistra Operations amended the Commodity-Linked Facility which, among other things, increased the aggregate available commitments to billion and extended the maturity date to October 1, 2025. 
 
 Under the Commodity-Linked Facility, the borrowing base is calculated on a weekly basis based on a set of theoretical transactions which approximate a portion of the hedge portfolio of Vistra Operations and certain of its subsidiaries in certain power markets, with availability thereunder not to exceed the aggregate available commitments nor be less than zero. Vistra Operations may, at its option, borrow an amount up to the borrowing base, as adjusted from time to time, provided that if outstanding borrowings at any time would exceed the borrowing base, Vistra Operations shall make a repayment to reduce outstanding borrowings to be less than or equal to the borrowing base. Vistra Operations intends to use any borrowings provided under the Commodity-Linked Facility to make cash postings as required under various commodity contracts to which Vistra Operations and its subsidiaries are parties as power prices increase from time-to time and for other working capital and general corporate purposes.

 to and (ii) the fee on any undrawn amounts with respect to the Commodity-Linked Facility will range from basis points to basis points.

 The Vistra Operations Commodity-Linked Credit Agreement includes a covenant, solely during a compliance period (which, for periods prior to the October 2024 amendment, in general, was applicable when the aggregate revolving borrowings exceeded of the revolving commitments), that requires the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio, which is based on the ratio of net first lien debt compared to an EBITDA calculation defined under the terms of the Commodity-Linked Facility, not to exceed to 1.00 (or, during a collateral suspension period, the consolidated total net leverage ratio, which is based on the ratio of consolidated total debt compared to an EBITDA calculation defined under the terms of the Commodity-Linked Facility, not to exceed to 1.00). 
 
 Vistra Zero Non-recourse Credit Agreement 
 
 On March 26, 2024, Vistra Zero entered into the Vistra Zero Credit Agreement. The Vistra Zero Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan (Term Loan B Facility) of up to million, which Vistra Zero borrowed in its entirety on March 26, 2024. Net proceeds of million were used (i) to pay issuance costs and (ii) for working capital and general corporate purposes. Vistra Zero's obligations under the Vistra Zero Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Vistra Zero, but are otherwise non-recourse to Vistra Operations and its other subsidiaries. Fees and expenses related to entering the agreement totaling million and a discount totaling million were capitalized as reductions in the carrying amount of the debt. 
 
 Under the Vistra Zero Credit Agreement, the interest applicable to the Term Loan B Facility is Term SOFR plus per annum. The Term Loan B Facility is not subject to a floor or credit spread adjustment but is subject to a "soft call" prepayment premium prior to the date that is six months following March 26, 2024. The weighted average interest rates before taking into consideration interest rate swaps on outstanding borrowings of million was as of September 30, 2024. Cash borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility are subject to required scheduled quarterly payments of million. Amounts paid cannot be reborrowed.

 Vistra Operations Secured Letter of Credit Facilities 
 
 Between August 2020 and July 2024, we entered into uncommitted standby letter of credit facilities with various banks (each, a Secured LOC Facility and collectively, the Secured LOC Facilities). The Secured LOC Facilities are secured by a first lien on substantially all of Vistra Operations' (and certain of its subsidiaries') assets (which ranks pari passu with the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities). The Secured LOC Facilities may be renewed annually and are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, billion of letters of credit were outstanding under the Secured LOC Facilities. 
 
 Each of the Secured LOC Facilities includes a covenant that requires the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed to 1.00 (or, for certain facilities that include a collateral suspension mechanism, during a collateral suspension period, the consolidated total net leverage ratio not to exceed to 1.00). 
 
 Vistra Operations Unsecured Alternative Letter of Credit Facilities

Fees and expenses related to the offering, including commissions and the original issue discount, totaled million and were capitalized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the debt. 
 
 Since 2019, Vistra Operations has issued and sold its senior secured notes in offerings to eligible purchasers under Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The indenture (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the Vistra Operations Senior Secured Indenture) governing the senior secured notes due 2024, the senior secured notes due 2025, the senior secured notes due 2027, the senior secured notes due 2029, the senior secured notes due 2033 and the Senior Secured Notes (collectively, as each may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the Senior Secured Notes) provides for the full and unconditional guarantee by certain of Vistra Operations' current and future subsidiaries that also guarantee the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities. The Senior Secured Notes are secured by a first-priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, which consists of a substantial portion of the property, assets and rights owned by Vistra Operations and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of Vistra Operations as subsidiary guarantors (collectively, the Guarantor Subsidiaries) as well as the stock of Vistra Operations held by Vistra Intermediate. The collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released if Vistra Operations' senior, unsecured long-term debt securities obtain an investment grade rating from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to reversion if such rating agencies withdraw the investment grade rating of Vistra Operations' senior, unsecured long-term debt securities or downgrade such rating below investment grade. The Vistra Operations Senior Secured Indenture contains certain covenants and restrictions, including, among others, restrictions on the ability of Vistra Operations and its subsidiaries, as applicable, to create certain liens, merge or consolidate with another entity, and sell all or substantially all of their assets.

 million (each such tranche, a revenue bond and collectively, the revenue bonds). Funds from the issuance of the revenue bonds were on-lent by the relevant governmental authority, as lender, to each of EHG or EHNG, as applicable, pursuant to individual loan agreements between the relevant governmental entity and EH entity (each such loan agreement, an on-lending agreement and collectively, the on-lending agreements). Under those on-lending agreements the relevant EH entity is obligated to provide contractual payments to service the principal and interest on the revenue bonds via payments on the loans. The repayment of the loans is not directly secured by the assets of the EH entities; rather such repayment is secured by a pledge of certain mortgage bonds issued by the EH entities to the relevant trustees under the respective revenue bonds. The mortgage bonds are issued by the relevant EH entity pursuant to an open-ended mortgage indenture (the base indenture), and supplemented by supplemental indentures adding the relevant tranche of mortgage bonds backing the related revenue bonds to the base indenture (as so supplemented, the mortgage indentures). The obligations under the mortgage bonds issued pursuant to the mortgage indentures are secured by substantially all assets of the EH entities, including their plants and related real estate. The obligations under mortgage indentures are cross-collateralized to each other, and provide that payments of principal and interest by the relevant EH entity under its on-lending agreement with the governmental authority constitute a dollar-for-dollar credit against the payment obligations of such EH entity under the mortgage indentures, such that the EH entities are never expected to make any payments under the bonds governed by the mortgage indentures. In the event of a default under the on-lending agreements (which are not cross-defaulted to each other), the trustee of the revenue bonds would be able to call the mortgage bonds due and, if unpaid, foreclose on the assets securing the mortgage bonds. The obligations of the EH entities under the on-lending agreements and the related mortgage indentures are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Energy Harbor. Neither the EH entities nor Energy Harbor provides credit support for any of the debt obligations of Vistra Operations. 
 
 Vistra Operations Senior Unsecured Notes

 Debt Repurchase Program 
 
 In April 2024, the Board authorized the voluntary repayment or repurchase of up to billion of outstanding debt, with such authorization expiring on December 31, 2024. 
 
 Accounts Receivable Financing 
 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program 
 
 TXU Energy Receivables Company LLC (RecCo), an indirect subsidiary of Vistra, has an accounts receivable financing facility (Receivables Facility) provided by issuers of asset-backed commercial paper and commercial banks (Purchasers). On April 8, 2024, the Receivables Facility was amended to increase the purchase limit from million to billion and to add Energy Harbor LLC, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Harbor, as an Originator. The Receivables Facility was renewed and amended in July 2024, extending the term of the Receivables Facility to July 2025. 
 
 In connection with the Receivables Facility, TXU Energy, Dynegy Energy Services, Ambit Texas, Value Based Brands, Energy Harbor LLC and TriEagle Energy, each indirect subsidiaries of Vistra and originators under the Receivables Facility (Originators), each sell and/or contribute, subject to certain exclusions, all of its receivables (other than any receivables excluded pursuant to the terms of the Receivables Facility), arising from the sale of electricity to its customers and related rights (Receivables), to RecCo, a consolidated, wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, direct subsidiary of TXU Energy. RecCo, in turn, is subject to certain conditions, and may draw under the Receivables Facility up to the limit described above to fund its acquisition of the Receivables from the Originators. RecCo has granted a security interest on the Receivables and all related assets for the benefit of the Purchasers under the Receivables Facility and Vistra Operations has agreed to guarantee the performance of the obligations of the Originators and TXU Energy, as the servicer, under the agreements governing the Receivables Facility. Amounts funded by the Purchasers to RecCo are reflected as short-term borrowings in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds and repayments under the Receivables Facility are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Receivables transferred to the Purchasers remain on Vistra's balance sheet and Vistra reflects a liability equal to the amount advanced by the Purchasers. The Company records interest expense on amounts advanced. TXU Energy continues to service, administer and collect the Receivables on behalf of RecCo and the Purchasers, as applicable. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Facility totaled million and were supported by billion of RecCo gross receivables. As of December 31, 2023, there were outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Facility. 
 
 Repurchase Facility 
 
 TXU Energy and the other Originators under the Receivables Facility have a repurchase facility (Repurchase Facility) that is provided on an uncommitted basis by a commercial bank as buyer (Buyer). In July 2024, the Repurchase Facility was renewed until July 2025 while maintaining the facility size of million. The Repurchase Facility is collateralized by a subordinated note (Subordinated Note) issued by RecCo in favor of TXU Energy for the benefit of Originators under the Receivables Facility and representing a portion of the outstanding balance of the purchase price paid for the Receivables sold by the Originators to RecCo under the Receivables Facility. Under the Repurchase Facility, TXU Energy may request that Buyer transfer funds to TXU Energy in exchange for a transfer of the Subordinated Note, with a simultaneous agreement by TXU Energy to transfer funds to Buyer at a date certain or on demand in exchange for the return of the Subordinated Note (collectively, the Repo Transaction). Each Repo Transaction is expected to have a term of , unless terminated earlier on demand by TXU Energy or terminated by Buyer after an event of default.

 Balance Sheet Presentation of Derivatives 
 
 We elect to report derivative assets and liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis without taking into consideration netting arrangements we have with counterparties to those derivatives. We maintain standardized master netting agreements with certain counterparties that allow for the right to offset assets and liabilities and collateral in order to reduce credit exposure between us and the counterparty. These agreements contain specific language related to margin requirements, monthly settlement netting, cross-commodity netting and early termination netting, which is negotiated with the contract counterparty. 
 
 Generally, margin deposits that contractually offset these derivative instruments are reported separately in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of certain margin amounts related to changes in fair value on CME transactions that are legally characterized as settlement of forward exposure rather than collateral. Margin deposits received from counterparties are primarily used for working capital or other general corporate purposes.

 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features of Derivatives 
 
 Our derivative contracts may contain certain credit risk-related contingent features that could trigger liquidity requirements in the form of cash collateral, letters of credit or some other form of credit enhancement. Certain of these agreements may require the posting of additional collateral if our credit rating is downgraded by one or more credit rating agencies or include cross-default contractual provisions that could result in the settlement of such contracts if there was a failure under other financing arrangements related to payment terms or other covenants.

 (b) Amounts include the offsetting fair value of in-the-money derivative contracts and net accounts receivable under master netting arrangements. 
 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk Related to Derivatives 
 
 We have concentrations of credit risk with the counterparties to our derivative contracts. As of September 30, 2024, total credit risk exposure to all counterparties related to derivative contracts totaled billion (including associated accounts receivable). The net exposure to those counterparties totaled million as of September 30, 2024, after taking into effect netting arrangements, setoff provisions and collateral, with the largest net exposure from any single counterparty totaling million. As of September 30, 2024, the credit risk exposure to the banking and financial sector represented of the total credit risk exposure and of the net exposure. 
 
 This concentration of credit risk increases the risk that a default by any of our counterparties could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We maintain credit risk policies with regard to our counterparties to minimize overall credit risk. These policies authorize specific risk mitigation procedures including, but not limited to, (i) requiring counterparties to have investment grade credit ratings, (ii) use of standardized master agreements with our counterparties that allow for netting of positive and negative exposures, and that detail credit enhancements (such as parent guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds, liens on assets and margin deposits) required in the event of a material downgrade in their credit rating.

 consolidated putative class action lawsuit pending in federal court in Wisconsin claiming damages resulting from alleged price manipulation through false reporting of natural gas prices to various index publications, wash trading and churn trading from 2000-2002. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants engaged in an antitrust conspiracy to inflate natural gas prices during the relevant time period and seek damages under the respective state antitrust statutes. In April 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Seventh Circuit Court) heard oral argument on an interlocutory appeal challenging the district court's order certifying a class. 
 
 Illinois Attorney General Complaint Against Illinois Gas Electric (IG E) In May 2022, the Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint against IG E, a subsidiary we acquired when we purchased Crius Energy Trust in July 2019. The complaint filed in Illinois state court alleges, among other things, that IG E engaged in improper marketing conduct and overcharged customers. The vast majority of the conduct in question occurred prior to our acquisition of IG E. In July 2022, we moved to dismiss the complaint, and in October 2022, the district court granted in part our motion to dismiss, barring all claims asserted by the Illinois Attorney General that were outside of the statute of limitations period, which now limits the period during which claims may be made to start in May 2017 rather than extending back to 2013 as the Illinois Attorney General had alleged in its complaint. 
 
 Ohio House Bill 6 ("HB6") In July 2019, Ohio adopted a law referred to as HB6, which, among other things, provided subsidies for two nuclear power plants which we acquired in March 2024 upon the closing of our merger with Energy Harbor. We had opposed enactment of that subsidy legislation at the time, and the nuclear subsidies were repealed in 2021 prior to any subsidies being distributed. The U.S. Attorney's Office conducted an investigation into the activities related to the passage of HB6, and Energy Harbor received a grand jury subpoena in July 2020 requiring production of certain information related to that investigation. Energy Harbor completed its responses to that subpoena by December 2021. In August 2020, the Ohio Attorney General filed a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) complaint against FirstEnergy Corp. and various Energy Harbor companies related to passage of HB6 State of Ohio ex rel. Dave Yost, Ohio Attorney General v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al. , Franklin County, Ohio Common Pleas Court Case No. 20CV006281 and State of Ohio ex rel. Dave Yost, Ohio Attorney General v.

 insurance companies against ERCOT, Vistra and several other defendants. The lawsuit seeks recovery of insurance funds paid out by these insurance companies to various policyholders for claims related to Winter Storm Uri, and that case has also now been consolidated with the MDL proceedings. In the summer of 2022, various defendant groups filed motions to dismiss five so-called bellwether cases, and the MDL court heard oral argument on those motions in October 2022. In January 2023, the MDL court ruled on the various motions to dismiss and denied the motions to dismiss of the generator defendants and the transmission distribution utilities defendants, but granted the motions of some of the other defendant groups, including the retail electric providers and ERCOT. In February 2023, the generator defendants filed a mandamus petition with the First Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas (First Court of Appeals) to review the MDL court's denial of the motion to dismiss. In December 2023, the First Court of Appeals in a unanimous decision granted our mandamus petition and instructed the MDL court to grant the motions to dismiss in full filed by the generator defendants. In January 2024, the plaintiffs filed a request with the full Court of Appeals to review that panel ruling. We believe we have strong defenses to these lawsuits and intend to defend against these cases vigorously.

 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and Good Neighbor Plan 
 
 In October 2015, the EPA revised the primary and secondary ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to lower the 8-hour standard for ozone emissions during ozone season (May to September). As required under the CAA, in October 2018, the State of Texas submitted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating that emissions from Texas sources do not contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with respect to the revised ozone NAAQS. In February 2023, the EPA disapproved Texas' SIP and the State of Texas, Luminant, certain trade groups, and others challenged that disapproval in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit Court). In March 2023, those same parties filed motions to stay the EPA's SIP disapproval in the Fifth Circuit Court, and the EPA moved to transfer our challenges to the D.C. Circuit Court or have those challenges dismissed. 
 
 In April 2022, prior to the EPA's disapproval of Texas' SIP, the EPA proposed a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address the 2015 ozone NAAQS. We, along with many other companies, trade groups, states and ISOs, including ERCOT, PJM and MISO, filed responsive comments to the EPA's proposal in June 2022, expressing concerns about certain elements of the proposal, particularly those that may result in challenges to electric reliability under certain conditions. In March 2023, the EPA administrator signed its final FIP, called the Good Neighbor Plan (GNP). The FIP applied to states beginning with the 2023 ozone seasons. States where Vistra operates generation units that would be subject to this rule are Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. Texas would be moved into the revised (and more restrictive) Group 3 trading program previously established in the Revised CSAPR Update Rule that includes emission budgets for 2023 that the EPA says are achievable through existing controls installed at power plants. Allowances will be limited under the program and will be further reduced beginning in ozone season 2026 to a level that is intended to reduce operating time of coal-fueled power plants during ozone season or force coal plants to retire, particularly those that do not have selective catalytic reduction systems such as our Martin Lake power plant.

 generation units (including the Martin Lake, Big Brown, Monticello, Sandow 4, Coleto Creek, Stryker 2 and Graham 2 plants). The compliance obligations in the program started on January 1, 2019. For NO X , the rule adopted the CSAPR's ozone program as BART and for particulate matter, the rule approved Texas' SIP that determines that no electricity generation units are subject to BART for particulate matter. In August 2020, the EPA issued a final rule affirming the prior BART final rule but also included additional revisions that were proposed in November 2019. Challenges to both the 2017 rule and the 2020 rules have been consolidated in the D.C. Circuit Court, where we have intervened in support of the EPA. We are in compliance with the rule, and the retirements of our Monticello, Big Brown and Sandow 4 plants have enhanced our ability to comply. The EPA is in the process of reconsidering the BART rule, and the challenges in the D.C. Circuit Court have been held in abeyance pending the EPA's final action on reconsideration. In May 2023, a proposed BART rule was published in the Federal Register that would withdraw the trading program provisions of the prior rule and would establish SO 2 limits on facilities in Texas, including Martin Lake and Coleto Creek. Under the current proposal, compliance would be required within years for Martin Lake and years for Coleto Creek. Due to the announced shutdown for Coleto Creek, we do not anticipate any impacts at that facility, and we are evaluating potential compliance options at Martin Lake should this proposal become final. We submitted comments to the EPA on this proposal in August 2023.

 plants (Oakland (California), Calumet (Illinois), Liberty (Pennsylvania), Miami Fort (Ohio) and Lake Hubbard (Texas)) operating in areas where the air quality monitoring data are currently exceeding the new PM2.5 standard. We have previously announced that our Miami Fort generation facility will close by the end of 2027. States will have to develop a plan (by late 2027 at the earliest) to get those areas into attainment and there would be a possibility that additional controls would be required for those sites. However, before the state begins this planning process, the designation process will occur within two years from the issuance of the final rule. The states develop recommendations about the boundaries of the nonattainment counties and the EPA must finalize the designations including the boundaries of each nonattainment area. 
 
 Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) 
 
 In November 2015, the EPA revised the ELGs for steam electricity generation facilities, which will impose more stringent standards (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams, such as flue gas desulfurization (FGD), fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control wastewaters. Various parties filed petitions for review of the ELG rule, and the petitions were consolidated in the Fifth Circuit Court. In April 2017, the EPA granted petitions requesting reconsideration of the ELG rule and administratively stayed the rule's compliance date deadlines. In April 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court vacated and remanded portions of the EPA's ELG rule pertaining to effluent limitations for legacy wastewater and leachate. The EPA published a final rule in October 2020 that extends the compliance date for both FGD and bottom ash transport water to no later than December 2025, as negotiated with the state permitting agency. Additionally, the final rule allows for a retirement exemption that exempts facilities certifying that units will retire by December 2028 provided certain effluent limitations are met. In November 2020, environmental groups petitioned for review of the new ELG revisions, and Vistra subsidiaries filed a motion to intervene in support of the EPA in December 2020. Notifications were made to Texas, Illinois and Ohio state agencies on the retirement exemption for applicable coal plants by the regulatory deadline of October 13, 2021. In May 2024, the EPA published the final ELG rule revisions, which contains new requirements for legacy wastewater and combustion residual leachate. The final rule also leaves in place the subcategory for facilities that permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. We are reviewing the rule for impact but believe it will require additional treatment costs for legacy wastewaters during pond closure activities and combustion residual leachate. At this time, we don't expect the impact of these additional treatment costs to be material. A number of parties have since challenged the rule and that case is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We are not a party to that litigation.

 utility operating companies, energy companies, and certain other industry associations, filed petitions for review with the D.C. Circuit Court and asked the court to determine that the EPA cannot implement or enforce the new purported requirements because the EPA has not followed the required procedures. The State of Texas and the TCEQ intervened in support of the petitions filed by the Vistra subsidiaries and USWAG, and various environmental groups have intervened on behalf of the EPA. In June 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court dismissed the petitions filed challenging the EPA's January 2022 statements because it found the statements did not amend the existing CCR regulations, and thus the D.C. Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to review them. 
 
 Legacy CCR Rulemaking 
 
 In May 2024, the EPA published a final rule that expands coverage of groundwater monitoring and closure requirements to the following two new categories of units: (a) legacy CCR surface impoundments which are CCR surface impoundments that no longer receive CCR but contained both CCR and liquids on or after October 19, 2015 and (b) "CCR management units" (CCRMUs) which generally could encompass noncontainerized ash deposits greater than one ton and impoundments and landfills that closed prior to October 19, 2015. As part of the rule, the EPA identified numerous CCR management units across the country, including of our potential units. The Vermilion ash ponds discussed below are the only unit which we believe qualify as a legacy CCR surface impoundment and given our closure plan for that site we do not believe rule will have any impact on that site. CCRMUs with 1,000 or more tons of CCR must comply with the CCR's groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure and post-closure requirements. For CCRMUs, complete facility evaluation reports are due within 33 months after publication of the rule, initial groundwater reports are due January 31, 2029, and the deadline to initiate closure, if needed, will start in 2029. Closure of the CCRMUs may also be deferred beyond those dates depending on certain factors, including where the CCRMU is located beneath critical infrastructure. In addition, certain closures may not be required when closure was previously approved under a state program. Because facility evaluation reports will determine our unit-specific compliance obligations, we cannot determine them at this time. In August 2024, we, along with USWAG, several other generating companies, and states, including Texas, filed a challenge to the rule in the D.C. Circuit Court. 
 
 MISO In 2012, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards onsite at our Baldwin and Vermilion facilities' CCR surface impoundments. These violation notices remain unresolved; however, in 2016, the IEPA approved our closure and post-closure care plans for the Baldwin old east, east, and west fly ash CCR surface impoundments. We have completed closure activities at those ponds at our Baldwin facility.

 CCR surface impoundments i.e. , the old east and the north impoundments) to the IEPA in 2012, and we submitted revised plans in 2014. In May 2017, in response to a request from the IEPA for additional information regarding the closure of these Vermilion surface impoundments, we agreed to perform additional groundwater sampling and closure options and riverbank stabilizing options. In June 2018, the IEPA issued a violation notice for alleged seep discharges claimed to be coming from the surface impoundments at our retired Vermilion facility, which is owned by our subsidiary DMG, and that notice was referred to the Illinois Attorney General. In June 2021, the Illinois Attorney General and the Vermilion County State Attorney filed a complaint in Illinois state court with an agreed interim consent order which the court subsequently entered. Given the violation notices and the enforcement action, the unique characteristics of the site, and the proximity of the site to the only national scenic river in Illinois, we agreed to enter into the interim consent order to resolve this matter. Per the terms of the agreed interim consent order, DMG is required to evaluate the closure alternatives under the requirements of the Illinois Coal Ash regulation (discussed below) and close the site by removal. In addition, the interim consent order requires that during the impoundment closure process, impacted groundwater will be collected before it leaves the site or enters the nearby Vermilion river and, if necessary, DMG will be required to install temporary riverbank protection if the river migrates within a certain distance of the impoundments. The interim order was modified in December 2022 to require certain amendments to the Safety Emergency Response Plan. In June 2023, the Illinois state court approved and entered the final consent order, which included the terms above and a requirement that when IEPA issues a final closure permit for the site, DMG will demolish the power station and submit for approval to construct an on-site landfill within the footprint of the former plant to store and manage the coal ash. These proposed closure costs are reflected in the ARO in the condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 17). 
 
 In 2012, the IEPA issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards at the Newton and Coffeen facilities' CCR surface impoundments. We are addressing these CCR surface impoundments in accordance with the federal CCR rule. 
 
 In July 2019, coal ash disposal and storage legislation in Illinois was enacted. The legislation addresses state requirements for the proper closure of coal ash ponds in the state of Illinois. The law tasks the IEPA and the IPCB to set up a series of guidelines, rules and permit requirements for closure of ash ponds. Under the final rule, which was finalized and became effective in April 2021, coal ash impoundment owners would be required to submit a closure alternative analysis to the IEPA for the selection of the best method for coal ash remediation at a particular site. The rule does not mandate closure by removal at any site. In May 2021, we, along with other industry petitioners, filed an appeal in the Illinois Fourth Judicial District over certain provisions of the final rule. In March 2024, the Illinois Fourth Judicial District issued a decision denying the industry petitions. We do not anticipate any impacts from this decision. In October 2021, we filed operating permit applications for impoundments as required by the Illinois coal ash rule, and filed construction permit applications for of our sites in January 2022 and of our sites in July 2022. additional closure construction application was filed for our Baldwin facility in August 2023. 
 
 For all of the above matters, if certain corrective action measures, including groundwater treatment or removal of ash, are required at any of our coal-fueled facilities, we may incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Illinois coal ash rule was finalized in April 2021 and does not require removal. However, the rule required us to undertake further site-specific evaluations required by each program. We will not know the full range of decommissioning costs, including groundwater remediation, if any, that ultimately may be required under the Illinois rule until permit applications have been approved by the IEPA and as such, an estimate of such costs cannot be made. The CCR surface impoundment and landfill closure costs currently reflected in our existing ARO liabilities reflect the costs of closure methods that our operations and environmental services teams determined were appropriate based on then existing closure requirements, and is reasonably possible to increase once the IEPA determines final closure requirements. Once the IEPA acts on our permit applications, we will reassess the decommissioning costs and adjust our ARO liabilities accordingly.

 complaints were filed at the FERC regarding the Zone 4 results for the 2015-2016 planning resource auction (PRA) conducted by MISO. Dynegy is a named party in of the complaints. The complainants, Public Citizen, Inc., the Illinois Attorney General and Southwestern Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Complainants), challenged the results of the PRA as unjust and unreasonable, requested rate relief/refunds, and requested changes to the MISO planning resource auction structure going forward. Complainants also alleged that Dynegy may have engaged in economic or physical withholding in Zone 4 constituting market manipulation in the PRA. The Independent Market Monitor for MISO (MISO IMM), which was responsible for monitoring the PRA, determined that all offers were competitive and that no physical or economic withholding occurred. The MISO IMM also stated, in a filing responding to the complaints, that there is no basis for the remedies sought by the Complainants. We filed our answer to these complaints explaining that we complied fully with the terms of the MISO tariff in connection with the PRA and disputing the allegations. The Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed a related complaint at the FERC against MISO in June 2015 requesting prospective changes to the MISO tariff. Dynegy also responded to this complaint with respect to Dynegy's conduct alleged in the complaint. 
 
 In October 2015, the FERC issued an order of nonpublic, formal investigation (the investigation) into whether market manipulation or other potential violations of the FERC orders, rules and regulations occurred before or during the PRA. 
 
 In December 2015, the FERC issued an order on the complaints requiring a number of prospective changes to the MISO tariff provisions effective as of the 2016-2017 planning resource auction. The order did not address the arguments of the Complainants regarding the PRA and stated that those issues remained under consideration and would be addressed in a future order. 
 
 In July 2019, the FERC issued an order denying the remaining issues raised by the complaints and noted that the investigation into Dynegy was closed. The FERC found that Dynegy's conduct did not constitute market manipulation and the results of the PRA were just and reasonable because the PRA was conducted in accordance with MISO's tariff. A request for rehearing was denied by the FERC in March 2020. The order was appealed by Public Citizen, Inc. to the D.C. Circuit Court in May 2020, and Vistra, Dynegy and Illinois Power Marketing Company intervened in the case in June 2020. In August 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a ruling denying Public Citizen, Inc.'s arguments that the FERC failed to meet its obligation to ensure just and reasonable rates because it did not review the prices resulting from the auction before those prices went into effect and that the FERC was arbitrary and capricious in failing to adequately explain its decision to close its investigation into whether Dynegy engaged in market manipulation. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted Public Citizen, Inc.'s petition in part finding that the FERC's decision that the auction results were just and reasonable solely because the auction process complied with the filed tariff was unreasoned and remanded the case back to the FERC for further proceedings on that issue. On February 4, 2022 the Illinois Attorney General and Public Citizen, Inc. filed a motion at the FERC requesting that the FERC on remand reverse its prior decision and either find that auction results were not just and reasonable and order Dynegy to pay refunds to Illinois or, in the alternative, initiate an evidentiary hearing and discovery. We filed a response to this motion and will continue to vigorously defend our position. In June 2022, the FERC issued an order on remand establishing paper hearing procedures and directing the Office of Enforcement to file a remand report within days providing the Office of Enforcement's assessment of Dynegy's actions with regard to the 2015-2016 planning resource auction. Although the FERC directed the Office of Enforcement to file a remand report, the FERC stated in the June 2022 order that it is not reopening the Office of Enforcement investigation. In September 2022, the Office of Enforcement filed its remand report stating that the Office of Enforcement staff found during its investigation that Dynegy knowingly engaged in manipulative behavior to set the Zone 4 price in the 2015-2016 PRA. In June 2023, the Company filed its initial brief and response to the remand report, and in August 2023 the Company filed a reply to the initial briefs from other parties. In June 2024, the FERC issued an order for an evidentiary hearing (or a trial before a FERC administrative law judge) to determine what the FERC cited as "disputed issues of material fact" that it believes cannot be resolved on the existing record and, in October 2024, issued an order dismissing our request for rehearing of the June 2024 order. We will continue to vigorously defend our position.

 billion and requires nuclear generation plant operators to provide financial protection for this amount. However, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims that exceed the billion limit for a single incident. As required, we insure against a possible nuclear incident at our nuclear facilities resulting in public nuclear-related bodily injury and property damage through a combination of private insurance and an industry-wide retrospective payment plan known as Secondary Financial Protection (SFP). 
 
 Under the SFP, in the event of any single nuclear liability loss in excess of million at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S., each operating licensed reactor in the U.S. is subject to an assessment of up to million. This approximately million maximum assessment is subject to increases for inflation every five years, with the next expected adjustment scheduled to occur by November 2028. Assessments are currently limited to million per operating licensed reactor per year per incident. As of September 30, 2024, our maximum potential assessment under the industry retrospective plan would be approximately million per incident but no more than million in any one year for each incident. The potential assessment is triggered by a nuclear liability loss in excess of million per accident at any nuclear facility. 
 
 The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires that nuclear generation plant license holders maintain at least billion of nuclear accident decontamination and reactor damage stabilization insurance, and requires that the proceeds thereof be used to place a plant in a safe and stable condition, to decontaminate a plant pursuant to a plan submitted to, and approved by, the NRC prior to using the proceeds for plant repair or restoration, or to provide for premature decommissioning. We maintain nuclear accident decontamination and reactor damage stabilization insurance for our Comanche Peak facility in the amount of billion and non-nuclear accident related property damage in the amount of billion (subject to a million deductible per accident except for natural hazards which are subject to a million deductible per accident), and losses excluded or above such limits are self-insured. We maintain nuclear accident decontamination and reactor damage stabilization insurance and non-nuclear accident related property damage for our Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry facilities in the amount of billion each (subject to a million deductible per accident), and losses excluded or above such limits are self-insured. 
 
 We also maintain Accidental Outage insurance to help cover the additional costs of obtaining replacement electricity from another source if the units are out of service for more than twelve weeks as a result of covered direct physical damage. Coverage at Comanche Peak provides for weekly payments per unit up to million for the first 52 weeks and up to million for a remaining 21 weeks for non-nuclear and up to million for a remaining 71 weeks for nuclear property damage outages. The total maximum coverage is million for non-nuclear property damage and million for nuclear property damage outages. Coverage at Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry facilities provide for weekly payments per unit up to million for the first 52 weeks and up to million for a remaining 52 weeks for non-nuclear and up to million for a remaining 110 weeks for nuclear property damage outages. The total maximum coverage is million for non-nuclear property damage and million for nuclear damage outages. There are two units at Comanche Peak and Beaver Valley, and coverage amounts applicable to each unit will reduce to if both units are out of service at the same time as a result of the same accident.

 Dividend Restrictions 
 
 The Vistra Operations Credit Agreement generally restricts the ability of Vistra Operations to make distributions to any direct or indirect parent unless such distributions are expressly permitted thereunder. As of September 30, 2024, Vistra Operations can distribute approximately billion to Parent under the Vistra Operations Credit Agreement without the consent of any party. The amount that can be distributed by Vistra Operations to Parent was partially reduced by distributions made by Vistra Operations to Parent of approximately million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and billion and billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, Vistra Operations may make distributions to Parent in amounts sufficient for Parent to make any payments required under the TRA or the Tax Matters Agreement or, to the extent arising out of Parent's ownership or operation of Vistra Operations, to pay any taxes or general operating or corporate overhead expenses. As of September 30, 2024, all of the restricted net assets of Vistra Operations may be distributed to Parent. 
 
 In addition to the restrictions under the Vistra Operations Credit Agreement, under applicable Delaware law, we are only permitted to make distributions either out of "surplus," which is defined as the excess of our net assets above our capital (the aggregate par value of all outstanding shares of our stock), or out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the distribution is declared or the prior fiscal year. 
 
 Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, and the Series C Preferred Stock, unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are being paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment on all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (and any parity securities), Series B Preferred Stock (and any parity securities), and Series C Preferred Stock (and any parity securities), respectively, with respect to dividends through the most recent dividend payment dates, (i) no dividend may be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any junior security (other than a dividend payable solely in junior securities with respect to both dividends and the liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of our affairs), including our common stock, and (ii) we may not redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any parity security or junior security, including our common stock, in each case subject to certain exceptions as described in the certificate of designation of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, and the Series C Preferred Stock, respectively.

 The Texas and East segments are engaged in electricity generation, wholesale energy sales and purchases, commodity risk management activities, fuel production and fuel logistics management. The Texas segment represents results from Vistra's electricity generation operations in the ERCOT market, other than assets that are now part of the Sunset or Asset Closure segments. The East segment represents results from Vistra's electricity generation operations in the Eastern Interconnection of the U.S. electric grid, other than assets that are now part of the Sunset or Asset Closure segments, and includes operations in the PJM, ISO-NE and NYISO markets. We determined it was appropriate to aggregate results from these markets into reportable segment, East, given similar economic characteristics. The West segment represents results from the CAISO market, including our battery ESS projects at our Moss Landing power plant site. 
 
 The Sunset segment consists of generation plants with announced retirement dates after December 31, 2024. Separately reporting the Sunset segment differentiates operating plants with announced retirement plans from our other operating plants in the Texas, East and West segments. We have allocated unrealized gains and losses on the commodity risk management activities to the Sunset segment for the generation plants that have announced retirement dates after December 31, 2024. 
 
 The Asset Closure segment is engaged in the decommissioning and reclamation of retired plants and mines (see Note 3). Upon movement of generation plant assets to either the Sunset or Asset Closure segments, prior year results are retrospectively adjusted, if the effects are material, for comparative purposes. Separately reporting the Asset Closure segment provides management with better information related to the performance and earnings power of Vistra's ongoing operations and facilitates management's focus on minimizing the cost associated with decommissioning and reclamation of retired plants and mines. 
 
 Corporate and Other represents the remaining non-segment operations consisting primarily of general corporate expenses, interest, taxes and other expenses related to our support functions that provide shared services to our operating segments.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements . 

Significant Activities and Events and Items Influencing Future Performance 
 
 Acquisition of Noncontrolling Interest 
 
 On September 18, 2024 (the UPA Transaction Date), Vistra Operations and Vistra Vision Holdings I LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Vistra Operations (Vistra Vision Holdings), entered into separate Unit Purchase Agreements (the UPAs) with each of Nuveen and Avenue, pursuant to which Vistra Vision Holdings has agreed to purchase each of Nuveen's and Avenue's combined 15 noncontrolling interest in Vistra Vision for 3.248 billion in cash subject to adjustment based on Vistra Vision cash distributions paid prior to closing (collectively, the Transaction). The Transaction is expected to close on December 31, 2024 (the Closing Date), subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, at which time Vistra Vision Holdings will own 100 of the equity interests in Vistra Vision. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the redeemable noncontrolling interest. 
 
 Comanche Peak Nuclear Plant License Renewal 
 
 In July 2024, our application for license renewal at our two-unit Comanche Peak Nuclear Plant was approved by the NRC. The licenses for Units 1 and 2 now extend into 2050 and 2053, respectively, an additional 20 years beyond our original licenses. 
 
 Planned Gas-Fueled Dispatchable Power in ERCOT 
 
 In May 2024, we announced our intention to add up to 2,000 MW of dispatchable, natural gas-fueled electricity capacity in west, central and north Texas consisting of the following projects: 
 
 Building up to 860 MW of advanced simple-cycle peaking plants to be located in west Texas to support the increasing power needs of the region, including the state's oil and gas industry. 
 Repowering the coal-fueled Coleto Creek Power Plant near Goliad, Texas, set to retire in 2027 to comply with EPA rules, as a natural-gas fueled plant with up to 600 MW of capacity. 
 Completing upgrades at existing natural gas-fueled plants that will add more than 500 MW of summer capacity and 100 MW of winter capacity. 
 
 The announcement is based on market reforms that policymakers passed in the 2023 Texas legislative session and that ERCOT and the PUCT are currently implementing. These market reforms are focused on grid reliability and proper market signals, and if successfully implemented have the potential to offer the regulatory framework needed to provide Vistra the confidence to make the long-term investments in these capacity projects. In addition, in July 2024, we filed applications with the PUCT under the Texas Energy Fund loan program seeking financing for the 860 MW of new advanced simple-cycle peaking plants referenced above. In August 2024, the PUCT notified Vistra that an application for one of its west Texas advanced simple-cycle peaking plants was selected for due diligence as part of the Texas Energy Fund loan program. An invitation to due diligence does not mean an applicant is awarded a loan. Vistra's decision to move forward with the new west Texas gas plant project is contingent upon supportive market reforms, approval of our Texas Energy Fund loan application, and other factors, including state and federal environmental regulations and long-term wholesale trends that continue to support gas generation.

 Merger with Energy Harbor 
 
 On March 1, 2024 (Merger Date), pursuant to a transaction agreement dated March 6, 2023 (Transaction Agreement), (i) Vistra Operations transferred certain of its subsidiary entities into Vistra Vision, (ii) Black Pen Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Vistra, merged with and into Energy Harbor, (iii) Energy Harbor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vistra Vision, and (iv) affiliates of Nuveen Asset Management, LLC (Nuveen) and Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. (Avenue) exchanged a portion of the Energy Harbor shares held by Nuveen and Avenue for a 15 equity interest of Vistra Vision (collectively, Energy Harbor Merger). The Energy Harbor Merger combines Energy Harbor's and Vistra's nuclear and retail businesses and certain Vistra Zero renewables and energy storage facilities to provide diversification and scale across multiple carbon-free technologies (dispatchable and renewables/storage) and the retail business. The cash consideration for Energy Harbor Merger was funded by Vistra Operations using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Commodity-Linked Facility, the Receivables Facility and the Repurchase Facility. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the Energy Harbor Merger. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
 
 In August 2022, the U.S. enacted the IRA, which, among other things, implements substantial new and modified energy tax credits, including recognizing the value of existing carbon-free nuclear power by providing for a nuclear PTC, a solar PTC, a first-time stand-alone battery storage investment tax credit. The IRA also implements a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on book income of certain large corporations, and a 1 excise tax on net stock repurchases. The section 45U nuclear PTC is available to existing nuclear facilities from 2024 through 2032 and provides a federal tax credit of up to 15/MWh, subject to phase out as power prices increase above 25/MWh (each subject to annual inflation adjustments). Treasury regulations are expected to further define the scope of the legislation in many important respects in the coming months, including critical guidance interpreting the nuclear PTC. The Company accounts for transferable ITCs and PTCs we expect to receive by analogy to the grant model within International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance . As discussed in Note 1, we have not recognized any revenues or receivables related to the IRC Section 45U credits through September 30, 2024, as we await U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue service guidance on how to interpret gross receipts in the calculation of the nuclear PTC. This guidance could have a significant impact on our estimates. Assuming an interpretation of gross receipts which excludes hedges from the calculation, our total PTC revenues for 2024 could be approximately 500 million. The amount of nuclear PTCs we record could be material to our 2024 results. We do not expect Vistra to be subject to the CAMT in the 2024 tax year as it applies only to corporations with a three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income in excess of 1 billion. We have taken the CAMT and relevant extensions or expansions of existing tax credits applicable to projects in our immediate development pipeline into account when forecasting cash taxes. 
 
 Repurchase of TRA Rights and Preferred Stock Issuance 
 
 On the Effective Date, Vistra entered into the TRA with a transfer agent on behalf of certain former first-lien creditors of TCEH, whereby we issued TRA rights to these former first-lien creditors of TCEH entitled to receive them under the Plan of Reorganization (TRA Rights). The TRA generally provides for the payment by us to holders of TRA Rights of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal and state income tax that we realize in periods after Emergence as a result of (i) certain transactions consummated pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization (including the step-up in tax basis in our assets resulting from the PrefCo Preferred Stock Sale), (ii) the tax basis of all assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of two CCGT natural gas-fueled generation facilities in April 2016 and (iii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of payments under the TRA, plus interest accruing from the due date of the applicable tax return. 
 
 Vistra began a series of repurchases of TRA Rights (Repurchase) from certain registered holders of the TRA Rights (Selling Holders) in December 2023. In connection with the Repurchase, holders of approximately 74 of the outstanding TRA Rights consented to certain amendments to the TRA which were effected in an Amended and Restated Tax Receivables Agreement (A R TRA), dated as of December 29, 2023. Such amendments to the TRA included (i) the removal of the Company's obligation to provide registered holders of the TRA Rights (Holders) with regular reporting and access to information, (ii) limitations on the transferability of the TRA Rights, (iii) removal of certain obligations of the Company in the event it incurs indebtedness and (iv) a change to the definition of "Change of Control." 
 
 During December 2023, we repurchased approximately 317 million TRA Rights in exchange for consideration of 1.50 per TRA Right totaling an aggregate purchase price of 476 million. The consideration for the December 31, 2023 Repurchase was conveyed through the issuance of 476,081 shares of Vistra Series C Preferred Stock to the Selling Holders.

Table of Contents 

 On January 11, 2024, we repurchased TRA Rights in exchange for consideration of 1.50 per TRA Right totaling an aggregate purchase price of 65 million using cash on hand. 
 
 On January 31, 2024, we announced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all outstanding TRA Rights in exchange for consideration of 1.50 per tendered TRA Right accepted for purchase prior to close of business of February 13, 2024 (Early Tender Date), which included an early tender premium of 0.05 per TRA Right accepted for purchase. On the Early Tender Date the Company repurchased TRA Rights in exchange for total consideration of 83 million and on February 28, 2024 additional TRA Rights were repurchased under the cash tender offer for total consideration of 3 million or 1.45 per TRA Right accepted for purchase. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased an aggregate 98 of the initial issuance of TRA Rights upon Emergence, of which 8,033,789 TRA Rights remain outstanding. See Note 12 to the Financial Statements for details of the TRA and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for details of the Series C Preferred Stock. 
 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 Historically, the base case assumption for U.S. electricity demand was for modest growth driven by the interplay of growth in population, industrial activity (such as an on-shore manufacturing) and new demand sources (such as electric vehicles), partially offset by continued advancements in energy efficiency. Multiple demand drivers such as emergence of large load data centers and electrification of oil field operations (specifically the Permian Basin of west Texas), have accelerated load growth in the geographic regions we serve. We are in various discussions with interested counterparties for the potential sale of power from our nuclear and gas facilities pursuant to long-term agreements to supply large load facilities. Such potential transactions are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including potential regulatory review and/or approval and adverse legislative action, which could impact the timing of, and our ability to consummate, a potential transaction. 
 
 The industry continues to experience supply chain constraints and labor shortages that have reduced the availability of certain equipment and supply relevant to construction of renewables projects, and increased (i) the lead time to procure certain materials necessary to maintain, and (ii) the labor costs associated with maintenance activity on our natural gas, nuclear and coal fleet. We are proactively managing the increased costs of materials and supply chain disruptions and continuing to prudently re-evaluate the business cases and timing of our planned development projects, which has resulted in a deferral of some of our planned capital spend for our renewables projects. In addition, we have proactively engaged our suppliers to secure key materials needed to maintain our existing generation facilities prior to future planned outages, and our Vistra Zero operational and development projects are anticipated to benefit from the impact of the IRA. The inflationary environment continues to drive elevated interest rates, resulting in increased refinancing or borrowing costs, including future non-recourse financing for our development projects and future refinancing expected in connection with debt due in 2025 and beyond. 
 
 We continue to closely monitor developments in the Russia and Ukraine conflict, specifically with regards to, (i) sanctions (or potential sanctions) against Russian energy exports and Russian nuclear fuel supply and enrichment activities, and (ii) actions by Russia to limit energy deliveries, which may further impact commodity prices in Europe and globally. The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act (PRUI Act) was approved by Congress and signed into law by President Biden and took effect on August 11, 2024. The PRUI Act prohibits importation of Russian uranium; however, the Department of Energy can issue waivers (subject to decreasing annual caps) until December 31, 2027 if there is no alternate source of low-enriched uranium available to keep U.S. nuclear reactors operating or is in the national interest. Additionally, passage of the PRUI Act enabled the allocation of 2.72 billion in federal funding to ramp up production of domestic uranium fuel. Our 2024 refueling plans have not been affected by the Russia and Ukraine conflict, nor have we seen any disruption to the delivery of nuclear fuel impacting our refuel schedules. We work with a diverse set of global nuclear fuel cycle suppliers to procure our nuclear fuel years in advance, and therefore, we have enough nuclear fuel contracted to support all our refueling needs through 2029. We continue to take affirmative action by building strategic inventory and deploying mitigating strategies in our procurement portfolio to ensure we can secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate our nuclear facilities through potential Russian supply disruption.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations is based upon its condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the accounting for assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. If the estimates differ materially from actual results, the impact in the condensed consolidated financial statements may be material. Except as discussed below, the Company's critical accounting policies are disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 Determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Energy Harbor Merger requires significant estimates and judgments. We determine fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements. The acquired assets and liabilities that involved the most subjectivity in determining fair value consisted of property, plant and equipment and asset retirement obligations: 
 
 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
 The fair value of each power plant acquired was estimated using a combination of an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses (i) our estimates of forecasted future growth and long term prices of electricity, capacity and nuclear fuel, and (ii) financial performance including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risks unique to the subject cash flows. These estimates are subjective in nature and require judgement to interpret market data. The market valuation method used prices paid for a reasonably similar asset by other purchasers in the relevant market, with adjustments relating to physical differences in the asset as well as their locations. 
 
 Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligation 
 
 To estimate our nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation on assets acquired from Energy Harbor, we used a discounted cash flow model based on our estimates of cost escalation factors and discount rates, and considered multiple decommissioning scenarios: (i) DECON, which assumes major decommissioning activities begin shortly after the facility ceases operations, and (ii) SAFSTOR, which assumes the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in a condition during decommissioning that allows the nuclear facility to be safely stored until subsequently decontaminated within 60 years after the facility ceases operations. The probability-weighted estimated future cash flows were discounted using our specific credit-adjusted, risk-free rates which reflected the secured nature of the obligation due to acquired investments in NDTs which are intended to fund the future decommissioning obligations.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Net income increased 1.335 billion to Net income of 1.837 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income increased 0.646 billion to Net income of 2.322 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information see the following discussion of our results of operations. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 In analyzing and planning for our business, we supplement our use of GAAP financial measures with non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed (i) with our GAAP results and (ii) the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that management uses to allocate resources, determine our ability to fund capital expenditures, assess performance against our peers, and evaluate overall financial performance, we believe they provide useful information for investors. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures and are, by definition, an incomplete understanding of Vistra and must be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review the condensed consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure. 
 
 When EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA is discussed in reference to performance on a consolidated basis, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is Net income (loss).

 GAAP operating income increased 1.754 billion to operating income of 2.588 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary favorable drivers for the increase are (i) a 2.138 billion change in unrealized mark-to-market activity as results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were favorably impacted by 1.855 billion in pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivative positions due to power and natural gas forward market curves moving down in the the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 283 million in pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market losses on derivative positions due to power forward market curves moving up in Texas in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and (ii) addition of the Energy Harbor assets in East. See further information on our derivative results in Energy-Related Commodity Contracts and Mark-to-Market Activities below. These favorable variances are partially offset by lower realized generation margins in Texas due to fewer scarcity pricing events compared to 2023 and a decrease in retail operating income which is driven by a shift in the seasonality of margins on retail contracts as summer supply costs increased compared to 2023, partially offset by the addition of Energy Harbor retail.

 GAAP operating income increased 923 million to operating income of 3.482 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver for the increase is an 870 million change in unrealized mark-to-market activity as results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were favorably impacted by 1.725 billion in pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivative positions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 855 million in pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gains on commodity derivative positions due to power and natural gas forward market curves moving down more significantly in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See further information on our derivative results in Energy-Related Commodity Contracts and Mark-to-Market Activities below. 
 
 In addition to the mark-to-market impacts discussed above, operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were impacted by additional factors including: 
 
 Favorable impacts: 
 
 Addition of Energy Harbor in March 2024 with results reflected in the East and Retail segments. 
 Expiration of legacy Vistra default service contracts in the East segment which resulted in higher-than-expected migration of customers at rates below prevailing wholesale market prices in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Similar contracts acquired from Energy Harbor are reflected in the Retail segment and are a driver of the favorable 2024 Retail results. 
 
 Unfavorable impacts: 
 
 Decreases in capacity revenues primarily in the Sunset segment. 
 Increase in interest expense driven by higher average borrowings and unrealized mark to market losses on interest rate swaps. 
 Increase in depreciation and amortization expense driven by addition of assets acquired from Energy Harbor. 
 Increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in Retail segment and Corp. and Other driven primarily by the addition of Energy Harbor.

 GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are unfavorable compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to other income of 89 million from the gain on sale of property in Freestone County, Texas in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Energy-Related Commodity Contracts and Mark-to-Market Activities 
 
 As forward power prices materially increased in 2022, our generation segments (Texas, East, West and Sunset) aggressively sold forward power for future years. We entered the 2023 and 2024 calendar years with more than 99 of our expected generation volumes hedged. While settled power prices in the three quarters of 2024 are lower than historical averages, the strategic hedging allowed us to lock in margins above what we would have been able to realize if unhedged. In the East segment, the margins we were able to lock in with hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are higher than the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 which is driving the increase in realized revenue net of fuel in the generation segments along with the addition of Energy Harbor. In the Texas segment, we materially benefited in the third quarter of 2023 as we were able to sell additional power in times of scarcity when real-time prices were high. There have been minimal scarcity events and periods of high pricing in Texas in 2024 and that is the primary driver of the unfavorable change in realized revenue net of fuel. The forward power sales are also the drivers of the changes in unrealized gains/losses on hedging activities. As power prices increase/decrease in comparison to what our generation segments have sold forward, the generation segments recognize unrealized losses/gains. The retail segment procures power from the generation segments to serve future load obligations and thus changes in forward power prices have an inverse effect on unrealized mark to market for the retail segment as compared to the generation segments. In the first three quarters of 2024, we saw a decrease in forward power prices in all our generation segments compared to our hedged positions which drove material unrealized gains in those segments, partially offset by unrealized losses in our retail segment. In the first three quarters of 2023, the non-Texas generation segments also experienced a decrease in forward power prices compared to our hedged positions which resulted in unrealized gains in those segments partially offset by unrealized losses in our retail segment. In Texas, forward power prices materially increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 which resulted in unrealized losses in Texas partially offset by unrealized gains in the retail segment.

 We have engaged in natural gas hedging activities to mitigate the risk of higher or lower wholesale electricity prices that have corresponded to increases or declines in natural gas prices. When natural gas prices are elevated or depressed, we continue to seek opportunities to manage our wholesale power price exposure through hedging activities, including forward wholesale and retail electricity sales. 
 
 Estimated hedging levels for generation volumes in our Texas, East, West and Sunset segments as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Balance of 2024 2025 Nuclear/Renewable/Coal Generation: Texas 100 100 East 100 66 Sunset 100 90 Natural Gas Generation: Texas 100 100 East 100 98 West 100 99

 Financial Condition 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 3.210 billion and 4.572 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The unfavorable change of 1.362 billion was primarily driven by a smaller decrease in net margin deposits (returns of cash related to commodity contracts which support our hedging strategy) as 855 million was returned in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.271 billion returned in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This unfavorable variance is partially offset by an increase in cash from realized operating income primarily due to the addition of Energy Harbor. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization expense, as reported as a reconciling adjustment in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, exceeds the amount reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations by 585 million and 333 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This difference represents amortization of nuclear fuel, which is reported as fuel costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations consistent with industry practice, as well as the amortization of intangible net assets and liabilities. These are reported under various line items in the other condensed consolidated statements of operations, including operating revenues, fuel and purchased power costs, and delivery fees (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements). 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 Cash used in investing activities totaled 4.959 billion and 1.382 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 3.577 billion was driven primarily by (a) 3.1 billion used to fund the Energy Harbor Merger and (b) a 386 million increase in capital expenditures driven by higher nuclear fuel purchases.

 Debt Activity 
 
 We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and have continued to state our objective to reduce our consolidated net leverage. We also intend to maintain adequate liquidity and pursue opportunities to refinance our long-term debt to extend maturities. 
 
 Increases in interest rates have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, increased borrowing costs. 
 
 See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for details of the Receivables Facility, Repurchase Facility, Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, Commodity-Linked Facility and other long-term debt. 
 
 Available Liquidity 
 
 The following table summarizes changes in available liquidity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents (a) 905 3,485 (2,580) Vistra Operations Credit Facilities Revolving Credit Facility (b) 2,457 1,213 1,244 Vistra Operations Commodity-Linked Facility (c) 633 1,101 (468) Total available liquidity (d)(e) 3,995 5,799 (1,804) 
 ____________ 
 (a) See the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in the Financial Statements and Cash Flows above for details of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease includes 3.1 billion that was used to fund the Energy Harbor Merger. 
 (b) The increase in availability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a 1.244 billion decrease in letters of credit outstanding under the facility. In October 2024, Vistra Operations amended the Revolving Credit Facility which, among other things, increased the revolving credit commitments to 3.440 billion and extended the maturity date to October 11, 2029. 
 (c) As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the borrowing bases are less than the facility limit of 1.575 billion. As of September 30, 2024, available capacity reflects the borrowing base of 633 million and no cash borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, available capacity reflects the borrowing base of 1.101 billion and no cash borrowings. In October 2024, Vistra Operations amended the Commodity-Linked Facility which, among other things, increased the aggregate available commitments to 1.75 billion and extended the maturity date to October 1, 2025.

 (e) Excludes any additional letters of credit that may be issued under the Secured LOC Facilities or the Alternative LOC Facilities. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for detail on our letter of credit facilities. 
 
 We believe that we will have access to sufficient liquidity to fund our other anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months, including the upcoming payments associated with the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Vistra Vision discussed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements. Our operational cash flows tend to be seasonal and weighted toward the second half of the year. 
 
 Including obligations assumed in the Energy Harbor Merger, our obligations under commodity purchase and services agreements, including capacity payments, nuclear fuel and natural gas take-or-pay contracts, coal contracts, business services and nuclear-related outsourcing and other purchase commitments, are expected to total approximately 3.0 billion in fiscal year 2024, 4.3 billion in 2025-2026, 1.6 billion in 2027-2028 and 1.2 billion thereafter. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Estimated 2024 capital expenditures and nuclear fuel purchases as of November 4, 2024 total approximately 2.053 billion and include: 
 
 808 million for investments in generation and mining facilities; 
 707 million for solar and energy storage development; 
 361 million for nuclear fuel purchases; and 
 177 million for other growth expenditures. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In October 2021, we announced that the Board authorized a share repurchase program (Share Repurchase Program) under which up to 2.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock may be repurchased. The Share Repurchase Program became effective on October 11, 2021, at which time it superseded the 2020 Share Repurchase Program (described below) and any authorization remaining as of such date. In August 2022, March 2023, February 2024 and October 2024, the Board authorized incremental amounts of 1.25 billion, 1.0 billion, 1.5 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively, for repurchases to bring the total authorized under the Share Repurchase Program to 6.75 billion as of November 4, 2024.

 Liquidity Effects of Commodity Hedging and Trading Activities 
 
 We have entered into commodity hedging and trading transactions that require us to post collateral if the forward price of the underlying commodity moves such that the hedging or trading instrument we hold has declined in value. We use cash, letters of credit, Eligible Assets (see Note 8 to the Financial Statements) and other forms of credit support to satisfy such collateral posting obligations. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for discussion of the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, the Commodity-Linked Facility, the Secured LOC Facilities and the Alternative LOC Facilities. 
 
 Exchange cleared transactions typically require initial margin i.e. , the upfront cash and/or letter of credit posted to take into account the size and maturity of the positions and credit quality) in addition to variation margin i.e. , the daily cash margin posted to take into account changes in the value of the underlying commodity). The amount of initial margin required is generally defined by exchange rules. Clearing agents, however, typically have the right to request additional initial margin based on various factors, including market depth, volatility and credit quality, which may be in the form of cash, letters of credit, a guaranty or other forms as negotiated with the clearing agent. Cash collateral received from counterparties is either used for working capital and other business purposes, including reducing borrowings under credit facilities, or is required to be deposited in a separate account and restricted from being used for working capital and other corporate purposes. With respect to over-the-counter transactions, counterparties generally have the right to substitute letters of credit for such cash collateral. In such event, the cash collateral previously posted would be returned to such counterparties, which would reduce liquidity in the event the cash was not restricted. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we received or posted cash, letters of credit, and Eligible Assets for commodity hedging and trading activities as follows: 
 
 970 million in cash and Eligible Assets have been posted with counterparties as compared to 1.244 billion posted as of December 31, 2023; 
 175 million in cash has been received from counterparties as compared to 45 million received as of December 31, 2023; 
 2.013 billion in letters of credit have been posted with counterparties as compared to 2.408 billion posted as of December 31, 2023; and 
 143 million in letters of credit have been received from counterparties as compared to 143 million received as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 See Collateral Support Obligations below for information related to collateral posted in accordance with the PUCT and ISO/RTO rules. 
 
 Income Tax Payments 
 
 In the next 12 months, we expect to make approximately 25 million in federal income tax payments, 60 million in state income tax payments and 1 million in TRA payments, offset by 3 million in state tax refunds. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were 2 million in federal income tax payments, 52 million in state income tax payments, 8 million in state income tax refunds and no TRA payments. 
 
 Financial Covenants 
 
 The Vistra Operations Credit Agreement and the Vistra Operations Commodity-Linked Credit Agreement each includes a covenant, solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commodity-Linked Facility and solely during a compliance period (which, for periods prior to the October 2024 amendments, in general, was applicable when the aggregate revolving borrowings and issued revolving letters of credit exceeded 30 of the revolving commitments, provided that solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility only such amounts in excess of 300 million were taken into account for purposes of determining whether a compliance period was in effect), that requires the consolidated first-lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 (or, during a collateral suspension period, the consolidated total net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00). In addition, each of the Secured LOC Facilities includes a covenant that requires the consolidated first-lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 (or, for certain facilities that include a collateral suspension mechanism, during a collateral suspension period, the consolidated total net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the Vistra Operations Credit Agreement, Vistra Operations Commodity-Linked Credit Agreement and Secured LOC Facilities financial covenants.

 See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for discussion of other covenants related to the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities. 
 
 Collateral Support Obligations 
 
 The RCT has rules in place to assure that parties can meet their mining reclamation obligations. In September 2016, the RCT agreed to a collateral bond of up to 975 million to support Luminant's reclamation obligations. The collateral bond is effectively a first lien on all of Vistra Operations' assets (which ranks pari passu with the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities) that contractually enables the RCT to be paid (up to 975 million) before the other first-lien lenders in the event of a liquidation of our assets. Collateral support relates to land mined or being mined and not yet reclaimed as well as land for which permits have been obtained but mining activities have not yet begun and land already reclaimed but not released from regulatory obligations by the RCT, and includes cost contingency amounts. 
 
 The PUCT has rules in place to assure adequate creditworthiness of each REP, including the ability to return customer deposits, if necessary. Under these rules, as of September 30, 2024, Vistra has posted letters of credit in the amount of 95 million with the PUCT, which is subject to adjustments. 
 
 The ISOs/RTOs we operate in have rules in place to assure adequate creditworthiness of parties that participate in the markets operated by those ISOs/RTOs. Under these rules, Vistra has posted collateral support totaling 585 million in the form of letters of credit, 81 million in the form of a surety bond and 3 million of cash as of September 30, 2024 (which is subject to daily adjustments based on settlement activity with the ISOs/RTOs). 
 
 Material Cross Default/Acceleration Provisions 
 
 Certain of our contractual arrangements contain provisions that could result in an event of default if there were a failure under financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe covenants that could result in an acceleration of payments due. Such provisions are referred to as "cross default" or "cross acceleration" provisions. 
 
 A default by Vistra Operations or any of its restricted subsidiaries in respect of certain specified indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 300 million and 17.5 of Consolidated EBITDA may result in a cross default under the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities and the Commodity-Linked Facility. Such a default would allow the lenders under each such facility to accelerate the maturity of outstanding balances under such facilities, which totaled approximately 2.481 billion and zero, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Each of Vistra Operations' (or its subsidiaries') commodity hedging agreements and interest rate swap agreements that are secured with a lien on its assets on a pari passu basis with the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities lenders contains a cross-default provision. An event of a default by Vistra Operations or any of its subsidiaries relating to indebtedness equal to or above a threshold defined in the applicable agreement that results in the acceleration of such debt, would give such counterparty under these hedging agreements the right to terminate its hedge or interest rate swap agreement with Vistra Operations (or its applicable subsidiary) and require all outstanding obligations under such agreement to be settled. 
 
 Under the Vistra Operations Senior Unsecured Indentures, the Vistra Operations Senior Secured Indenture and the Indenture governing the 7.233 Senior Secured Notes, a default under any document evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money by Vistra Operations or any Guarantor Subsidiary for failure to pay principal when due at final maturity or that results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in an aggregate amount of 300 million or more may result in a cross default under the Vistra Operations Senior Unsecured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes, the 7.233 Senior Secured Notes, the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, the Receivables Facility, the Commodity-Linked Facility and other current or future documents evidencing any indebtedness for borrowed money by the applicable borrower or issuer, as the case may be, and the applicable Guarantor Subsidiaries party thereto. 
 
 Additionally, we enter into energy-related physical and financial contracts, the master forms of which contain provisions whereby an event of default or acceleration of settlement would occur if we were to default under an obligation in respect of borrowings in excess of thresholds, which may vary by contract. 
 
 80 

Table of Contents 

 The Receivables Facility contains a cross-default provision. The cross-default provision applies, among other instances, if TXU Energy, Dynegy Energy Services, Ambit Texas, Value Based Brands, Energy Harbor LLC, TriEagle Energy, each indirect subsidiaries of Vistra and originators under the Receivables Facility (Originators), and Vistra or any of their respective subsidiaries fails to make a payment of principal or interest on any indebtedness that is outstanding in a principal amount of at least 300 million, in the case of Vistra Operations, and in a principal amount of at least 50 million, in the case of TXU Energy or any of the other Originators, after the expiration of any applicable grace period, or if other events occur or circumstances exist under such indebtedness which give rise to a right of the debtholder to accelerate such indebtedness, or if such indebtedness becomes due before its stated maturity. If this cross-default provision is triggered, a termination event under the Receivables Facility would occur and the Receivables Facility may be terminated. 
 
 The Repurchase Facility contains a cross-default provision. The cross-default provision applies, among other instances, if an event of default (or similar event) occurs under the Receivables Facility or the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities. If this cross-default provision is triggered, a termination event under the Repurchase Facility would occur and the Repurchase Facility may be terminated. 
 
 Under the Secured LOC Facilities, a default by Vistra Operations or any of its restricted subsidiaries in respect of certain specified indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of 300 million may result in a cross default under the Secured LOC Facilities. In addition, a default under any document evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money by Vistra Operations or any Guarantor Subsidiary for failure to pay principal when due at final maturity or that results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in an aggregate amount of 300 million or more, may result in a termination of the Secured LOC Facilities. 
 
 Under the Alternative LOC Facilities, a default by Vistra Operations or any of its restricted subsidiaries in respect of certain specified indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 300 million and 17.5 of Consolidated EBITDA may result in a cross default under the Alternative LOC Facilities. In addition, a default under any document evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money by Vistra Operations or any Guarantor Subsidiary for failure to pay principal when due at final maturity or that results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in an aggregate amount exceeding the threshold above, may result in a termination of the Alternative LOC Facilities. 
 
 Under the Vistra Operations Senior Unsecured Indenture and the Vistra Operations Senior Secured Indenture governing the 7.750 Senior Unsecured Notes, the 6.875 Senior Unsecured Notes, the 6.950 Senior Secured Notes and the 6.000 Senior Secured Notes, a default under any document evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money by Vistra Operations or any Guarantor Subsidiary for failure to pay principal when due at final maturity or that results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in an aggregate amount that exceeds the greater of 1.5 of total assets and 600 million may result in a cross default under the respective notes and other current or future documents evidencing any indebtedness for borrowed money by the applicable borrower or issuer, as the case may be, and the applicable Guarantor Subsidiaries party thereto. 
 
 A default by Vistra Zero or any of its restricted subsidiaries in respect of certain specified indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 100 million and 75 of Consolidated EBITDA may result in a cross default under the Vistra Zero Credit Agreement. Such a default would allow the lenders under each such facility to accelerate the maturity of outstanding balances under such facilities, which totaled approximately 697 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Under the UPAs, a default under any document evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money by Vistra Operations or any Guarantor Subsidiary that results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in an aggregate amount that exceeds the greater of 1.5 of total assets and 600 million may result in a cross default under the UPAs. Such a default would result in the payment obligations under the UPA of Vistra Vision Holdings and/or any guarantor thereunder becoming immediately due and payable.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk is the risk that in the normal course of business we may experience a loss in value because of changes in market conditions that affect economic factors such as commodity prices, interest rates and counterparty credit. Our exposure to market risk is affected by several factors, including the size, duration and composition of our energy and financial portfolio, as well as the volatility and liquidity of markets. Instruments used to manage this exposure include interest rate swaps to hedge debt costs, as well as exchange-traded, over-the-counter contracts and other contractual arrangements to hedge commodity prices. 
 
 Risk Oversight 
 
 We manage the commodity price, counterparty credit and commodity-related operational risk related to the competitive energy business within limitations established by senior management and in accordance with overall risk management policies. Interest rate risk is managed centrally by our treasury function. Market risks are monitored by risk management groups that operate independently of the wholesale commercial operations, utilizing defined practices and analytical methodologies. These techniques measure the risk of change in value of the portfolio of contracts and the hypothetical effect on this value from changes in market conditions and include, but are not limited to, position reporting and review, Value at Risk (VaR) methodologies and stress test scenarios. Key risk control activities include, but are not limited to, transaction review and approval (including credit review), operational and market risk measurement, transaction authority oversight, validation of transaction capture, market price validation and reporting, and portfolio valuation and reporting, including mark-to-market valuation, VaR and other risk measurement metrics. 
 
 Vistra has a risk management organization that enforces applicable risk limits, including the respective policies and procedures to ensure compliance with such limits, and evaluates the risks inherent in our businesses. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Our business is subject to the inherent risks of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products it markets or purchases. We actively manage the portfolio of generation assets, fuel supply and retail sales load to mitigate the near-term impacts of these risks on results of operations. Similar to other participants in the market, we cannot fully manage the long-term value impact of structural declines or increases in natural gas and power prices. 
 
 In managing energy price risk, we enter into a variety of market transactions including, but not limited to, short- and long-term contracts for physical delivery, exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial contracts and bilateral contracts with customers. Activities include hedging, the structuring of long-term contractual arrangements and proprietary trading. We continuously monitor the valuation of identified risks and adjust positions based on current market conditions. We strive to use consistent assumptions regarding forward market price curves in evaluating and recording the effects of commodity price risk. 
 
 VaR Methodology 
 
 A VaR methodology is used to measure the amount of market risk that exists within the portfolio under a variety of market conditions. The resultant VaR produces an estimate of a portfolio's potential for loss given a specified confidence level and considers, among other things, market movements utilizing standard statistical techniques given historical and projected market prices and volatilities. 
 
 Parametric processes are used to calculate VaR and are considered by management to be the most effective way to estimate changes in a portfolio's value based on assumed market conditions for liquid markets. The use of these methods requires a number of key assumptions, such as use of (i) an assumed confidence level, (ii) an assumed holding period i.e. , the time necessary for management action, such as to liquidate positions); and (iii) historical estimates of volatility and correlation data. The table below details certain VaR measures related to various portfolios of contracts.

Table of Contents 

 VaR for Underlying Generation Assets and Energy-Related Contracts 
 
 This measurement estimates the potential loss in value, due to changes in market conditions, of all underlying generation assets and contracts, based on a 95 confidence level and an assumed holding period of 60 days. The forward period covered by this calculation includes the current and subsequent calendar year at the time of calculation. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Year Ended December 31, 2023 (in millions) Month-end average VaR 274 190 Month-end high VaR 371 423 Month-end low VaR 196 115 
 
 The month-end average VaR risk measure increased in 2024 due to higher volumes following the Energy Harbor Merger. 
 
 Price Sensitivities 
 
 The following sensitivity table provides approximate estimates of the potential impact of movements in power prices and spark spreads (the difference between the power revenue and fuel expense of natural gas-fired generation as calculated using an assumed Heat Rate of 7.2 MMBtu/MWh) on realized pre-tax earnings (in millions) taking into account the hedge positions noted above for the periods presented. The residual natural gas position is calculated based on two steps: first, calculating the difference between actual Heat Rates of our natural gas generation units and the assumed 7.2 Heat Rate used to calculate the sensitivity to spark spreads; and second, calculating the residual natural gas exposure that is not already included in the natural gas generation spark spread sensitivity shown in the table below. The estimates related to price sensitivity are based on our expected generation, related hedges and forward prices as of September 30, 2024.

 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We manage our interest rate risk to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our results of operations and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, a majority of our borrowings have fixed interest rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the potential reduction of annual pretax earnings over the next twelve months due to a one percentage-point (100 basis points) increase in floating interest rates on long-term debt totaled approximately 9 million taking into account the interest rate swaps discussed in Note 10 to Financial Statements. The inflationary environment continues to drive elevated interest rates, resulting in increased recently completed and expected refinancing or borrowing costs. See Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations Significant Activities and Events, and Items Influencing Future Performance Macroeconomic Conditions. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk relates to the risk of loss associated with nonperformance by counterparties. We minimize credit risk by evaluating potential counterparties, monitoring ongoing counterparty risk and assessing overall portfolio risk. This includes review of counterparty financial condition, current and potential credit exposures, credit rating and other quantitative and qualitative credit criteria. We also employ certain risk mitigation practices, including utilization of standardized master agreements that provide for netting and setoff rights, as well as credit enhancements such as margin deposits and customer deposits, letters of credit, parental guarantees and surety bonds. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of this exposure. 
 
 Credit Exposure 
 
 Our gross credit exposure (excluding collateral impacts) associated with retail and wholesale trade accounts receivable and net derivative assets arising from commodity contracts and hedging and trading activities totaled 2.919 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Retail segment credit exposure totaled approximately 1.913 billion, including 1.902 billion of trade accounts receivable and 11 million related to derivatives. Cash deposits and letters of credit held as collateral for these receivables totaled 69 million, resulting in a net exposure of 1.844 billion. Allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable are established for the expected loss from nonpayment by these customers based on historical experience, market or operational conditions and changes in the financial condition of large business customers. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, aggregate Texas, East, Sunset and Asset Closure segments credit exposure totaled 1.006 billion including 889 million related to derivative assets and 117 million of trade accounts receivable, after taking into account master netting agreement provisions but excluding collateral impacts. 
 
 Including collateral posted to us by counterparties, our net Texas, East, Sunset and Asset Closure segments exposure was 744 million, as seen in the following table that presents the distribution of credit exposure by counterparty credit quality as of September 30, 2024. Credit collateral includes cash and letters of credit but excludes other credit enhancements such as guarantees or liens on assets. 
 Exposure Before Credit Collateral Credit Collateral Net Exposure (in millions) Investment grade 706 172 534 Below investment grade or no rating 300 90 210 Totals 1,006 262 744 
 
 Significant i.e. , 10 or greater) concentration of credit exposure exists with one counterparty, which represents an aggregate 250 million, or 34 , of our total net exposure as of September 30, 2024. We view exposure to this counterparty to be within an acceptable level of risk tolerance due to the counterparty's credit ratings, the counterparty's market role and deemed creditworthiness and the importance of our business relationship with the counterparty. An event of default by one or more counterparties could subsequently result in termination-related settlement payments that reduce available liquidity if amounts such as margin deposits are owed to the counterparties or delays in receipts of expected settlements owed to us.

Table of Contents 

 Contracts classified as "normal" purchase or sale and non-derivative contractual commitments are not marked-to-market in the financial statements and are excluded from the detail above. Such contractual commitments may contain pricing that is favorable considering current market conditions and therefore represent economic risk if the counterparties do not perform. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) in effect at September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation performed, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, other than additional controls associated with the integration of Energy Harbor due to the Energy Harbor Merger, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Reference is made to the discussion in Note 14 to the Financial Statements regarding legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. We could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. 
 
 We may suffer material losses, costs and liabilities due to operation risks, regulatory risks, and the risk of nuclear accidents arising from the ownership and operation of the nuclear generation facilities. 
 
 We own and operate nuclear generation facilities in Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities involves certain risks. These risks include: 
 
 unscheduled outages or unexpected costs due to equipment, mechanical, structural, cybersecurity, insider threat, third-party compromise or other problems; 
 inadequacy or lapses in maintenance protocols; 
 the impairment of reactor operation and safety systems due to human error or force majeure; 
 the costs of, and liabilities relating to, storage, handling, treatment, transport, release, use and disposal of radioactive materials; 
 the costs of procuring nuclear fuel, including impacts from restrictions on imports from Russia or China (see Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations Significant Activities and Events, and Items Influencing Future Performance Macroeconomic Conditions ); 
 the costs of storing and maintaining spent nuclear fuel at our on-site dry cask storage facility; 
 terrorist or cybersecurity attacks by nation-states or other threat actors and the cost to protect and recover against any such attack; 
 the impact of a natural disaster; 
 financial risk associated with retrospective insurance premium that could become due under secondary coverage required by the Price Anderson Act; 
 limitations on the amounts and types of insurance coverage commercially available; and 
 uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of modifying or decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their useful lives. 
 
 Our financial performance could be materially and negatively affected by matters arising from our ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, including any prolonged unavailability of any of our nuclear generation facilities. The following are among the more significant related risks: 
 
 Operational Risk Operations at any generation facility could degrade to the point where the facility would have to be shut down. If such degradations were to occur at a nuclear generation facility, the process of identifying and correcting the causes of the operational downgrade to return the facility to operation could require significant time and expense, resulting in both lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. Furthermore, a shut-down or failure at any other nuclear generation facility could cause regulators to require a shut-down or reduced availability at our nuclear generation facilities. 
 
 Regulatory Risk The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under it or the terms of the licenses of nuclear generation facilities. Unless extended, as to which no assurance can be given, the NRC operating license for the unit at the Perry Facility will expire in 2026, and is pending a license renewal application subject to review by the NRC. Changes in regulations by the NRC could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or result in increased operating or decommissioning costs.

Table of Contents 

 Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage. Our nuclear operations produce various types of nuclear waste materials, including spent nuclear fuel. The availability of a national repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and the timing of that facility opening will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of spent nuclear fuel and the ultimate amounts received from the DOE to reimburse us for these costs. Any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for spent nuclear fuel could adversely affect our ability to decommission fully our nuclear units. We cannot predict whether a fee may be established or to what extent in the future for spent nuclear fuel disposal. 
 
 Decommissioning Obligation and Funding . NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. 
 
 Actual costs to decommission our nuclear facilities may substantially exceed our estimates as a result of changes in the approach and timing of decommissioning activities, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory requirements, other changes in our estimates or ability to effectively execute on our planned decommissioning activities. 
 
 Forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results could differ significantly from current estimates. In addition, financial market performance directly affects the asset values in the NDT trust funds. If the investments held by our PJM NDT funds are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of our nuclear units, we could be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future NRC minimum funding requirements are met. 
 
 Nuclear Accident Risk Although the safety record of our nuclear generation facilities generally has been very good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred at nuclear stations both in the U.S. and elsewhere. The consequences of an accident can be severe and include loss of life, injury, lasting negative health impacts and property damage. Any accident, or perceived accident, could result in significant liabilities that may exceed our resources, including insurance coverages, and could damage our reputation. Such liabilities to third parties are currently covered by a primary layer of financial protection required by the Price Anderson Act in the form of insurance carried by the owners of each nuclear facility and by a secondary layer of insurance coverage into which each nuclear licensee in the country is required to contribute in the event of an accident at any facility which exceeds the primary level of coverage for that facility. Our potential exposure for the secondary layer of coverage is currently capped at 165.9 million per reactor but is subject to adjustment for inflation, and the total retrospective premium per reactor per incident is capped at 24.7 million in any one year. Any such resulting liability from a nuclear accident could exceed our resources, including insurance coverage, and could ultimately result in the suspension or termination of power generation from the impacted facility. Such accidents could also result in property damage to our nuclear plant and equipment, which could exceed coverage available under insurance provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited. If a serious nuclear incident were to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

 In October 2021, we announced that the Board had authorized a share repurchase program (Share Repurchase Program) under which up to 2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock may be repurchased. The Share Repurchase Program became effective on October 11, 2021. In August 2022, March 2023, February 2024 and October 2024, the Board authorized incremental amounts of 1.25 billion, 1.0 billion, 1.5 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively, for repurchases to bring the total authorized under the Share Repurchase Program to 6.75 billion as of November 4, 2024. We expect to complete repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program by the end of 2026. 
 
 See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more information concerning the Share Repurchase Program. 

Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 
 None. 

Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 
 Vistra currently owns and operates, or is in the process of reclaiming, 12 surface lignite coal mines in Texas to provide fuel for its electricity generation facilities. Vistra also owns or leases, and is in the process of reclaiming, two waste-to-energy surface facilities in Pennsylvania. These mining operations are regulated by the MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the Mine Act), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies such as the RCT and Office of Surface Mining. The MSHA inspects U.S. mines, including Vistra's mines, on a regular basis, and if it believes a violation of the Mine Act or any health or safety standard or other regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation or order, generally accompanied by a proposed fine or assessment. Such citations and orders can be contested and appealed, which often results in a reduction of the severity and amount of fines and assessments and sometimes results in dismissal. Disclosure of MSHA citations, orders and proposed assessments are provided in Exhibit 95.1 to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors or any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement".

Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) , will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to 

 41 

Section 2.13 , release or diminish the Borrower s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice. 
 (d) Alternate Rate of Interest . 
 (i) Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this Section 2.10(d) , if 
 (1) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a SOFR Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Term SOFR Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, Daily Simple SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR (including because the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Daily Simple SOFR is not available or published on a current basis) for such Interest Period or 
 (2) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a SOFR Borrowing, the Term SOFR Rate or Daily Simple SOFR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Borrowings (or its Borrowings) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period 
 then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant benchmark rate and (y) the Borrower delivers a Notice of Conversion or Continuation in accordance with the terms of Section 2.6, any Notice of Conversion or Continuation that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Borrowing of SOFR Loans of the applicable Type may be revoked by the Borrower and, failing that, shall instead be deemed to be a Notice of Conversion or Continuation for an ABR Loan. Furthermore, if any SOFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 2.10(d)(i) with respect to the Term SOFR Rate or Daily Simple SOFR, as applicable, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant benchmark rate and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Notice of Conversion or Continuation in accordance with the terms of Section 2.6, any such SOFR Loan of the applicable Type shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such SOFR Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan. 
 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Credit Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5 00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party 

 42 

to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 
 (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including in Section 13.1 of this Agreement) or in any other Credit Document, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document.

Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) . 
 (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate) and either (a) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (b) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (a) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (b) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (vi) The Borrower may revoke any request for a Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans, or a conversion to or continuation of a Term SOFR Loan to be converted or continued, during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to an ABR Loan. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Term SOFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Term SOFR Rate, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) , any Term SOFR Loan shall on the 

43 

last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Revolving Credit Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, a ABR Loan. 
 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.10 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in substantially the same manner as applied to other similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities.

If (i) any payment of principal of any Term SOFR Loan is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such SOFR Loan as a result of a payment or conversion pursuant to Section 2.5 , 2.6 , 2.10 , 5.1 , 5.2 or 13.7 , as a result of acceleration of the maturity of the Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 11 or for any other reason, (ii) any Borrowing of SOFR Loans is not made as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Borrowing, (iii) any ABR Loan is not converted into a SOFR Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation, (iv) any SOFR Loan is not continued as a SOFR Loan, in each case, as the case may be, as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (v) any prepayment of principal of any SOFR Loan is not made as a result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2 , the Borrower shall, after receipt of a written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, failure to convert, failure to continue or failure to prepay, including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such SOFR Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in substantially the same manner as applied to other similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities. For the avoidance of doubt, the reallocation of SOFR Loans on the First Amendment Effective Date as contemplated by the First Amendment shall not require the payment of any compensation under this Section 2.11 . For the avoidance of doubt, the reallocation of SOFR Loans on the Second Amendment Effective Date, Third Amendment Effective Date, Fourth Amendment Effective Date, Fifth Amendment Effective Date and , Seventh Amendment Effective Date and Eighth Amendment Effective Date as contemplated by the Second Amendment, Third Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and , Seventh Amendment and Eighth Amendment , respectively, shall not require the payment of any compensation under this Section 2.11 .

Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 2.10 or 5.4 . 
 2.13. Notice of Certain Costs . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10 , 2.11 or 5.4 is given by any Lender more than 180 days after such Lender has knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts described in such Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to compensation under Section 2.10 , 2.11 or 5.4 , as the case 

 44 

may be, for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the 181st day prior to the giving of such notice to the Borrower.

If the Borrower or any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall be required by Applicable Law to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable by the Borrower or any Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that after making all such required deductions and withholdings (including such deductions or withholdings of Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.4 ), the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) the Borrower or such Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority within the time allowed and in accordance with Applicable Law.

A Lender s obligation under the prior sentence shall apply only if the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has made a request for such documentation. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4(d) , the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.4(e)(i)-(iv) , 5.4(i) and 5.4(j) below) by a Lender shall not be required if in such Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to Sections 5.4(d) , 5.4(e) , 5.4(i) and 5.4(j) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Credit Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Sections 5.4(d) , 5.4(e) , 5.4(i) and 5.4(j) . 
 (e) Each Non-U.S. Lender with respect to any Revolving Credit Loan made to the Borrower shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable

 (iv) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner or

 If in any such case any Change in Law has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders any such form inapplicable or would prevent such Non-U.S. Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it, such Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly so advise the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 
 (f) If any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of an Indemnified Tax (including an Other Tax) for which a payment of additional amounts or indemnification payments has been made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, then the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such amount (net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other than any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) as the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the 

 49 

Collateral Agent, as the case may be, determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be the proportion of the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position (taking into account reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) imposed on the refund) than it would have been in if the payment had not been required provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in the event the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. A Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall claim any refund that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its sole discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim. None of any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be obliged to disclose any information regarding its tax affairs or computations to any Credit Party in connection with this clause (f) or any other provision of this Section 5.4 . 
 (g) If the Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists for contesting a Tax, each Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request in challenging such Tax.

The Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Lender and Agent harmless against any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Person in connection with any request made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.4(g) . Nothing in this Section 5.4(g) shall obligate any Lender or Agent to take any action that such Person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in a material detriment to such Person.

 2.4. Disbursement of Funds . 
 (a) No later than 2 00 p.m. on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing (including Borrowings of Revolving Credit Loans to reimburse Unpaid Drawings under Revolving Letters of Credit), each Lender will make available its pro rata portion, if any, of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any such Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available such amount to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender.

 108 

the then-applicable rate of interest or fees, calculated in accordance with Section 2.8 , for the Loans of the applicable Class.

 (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Term SOFR Loans (other than any increase or reduction attributable to (i) Indemnified Taxes or Taxes indemnifiable under Section 5.4 and (ii) Excluded Taxes) because of (x) any change since the Closing Date in any Applicable Law (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new Applicable Law), such as, for example, without limitation, a change in official reserve requirements, and or (y) other circumstances affecting the interbank SOFR market or the position of such Lender in such market or 
 (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Term SOFR Loans has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Applicable Law (or would conflict with any such Applicable Law not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date that materially and adversely affects the interbank SOFR market 
 then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice (if by telephone, confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders).

 115 

(1) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Term SOFR Rate (including because the Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis) for such Interest Period or 
 (2) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Borrowing, the Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Borrowings (or its Borrowings) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period 
 then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant benchmark rate and (y) the Borrower delivers a Notice of Conversion or Continuation in accordance with the terms of Section 2.6 , any Notice of Conversion or Continuation that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term SOFR Borrowing may be revoked by the Borrower and, failing that, shall instead be deemed to be a Notice of Conversion or Continuation for an ABR Loan. Furthermore, if any Term SOFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 2.10(f)(i) with respect to the Term SOFR Rate, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant benchmark rate and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Notice of Conversion or Continuation in accordance with the terms of Section 2.6 , any such Term SOFR Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Term SOFR Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan.

 116 

not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.

Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Revolving Credit Lender or Term Loan Lender, as applicable (or group of Revolving Credit Lenders or Term Loan Lenders, as applicable), pursuant to this Section 2.10(f) , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.10(f) . 
 (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate) and either (a) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (b) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (a) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (b) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (vi) The Borrower may revoke any request for a Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans, or a conversion to or continuation of a Term SOFR Loan to be converted or continued, during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to an ABR Loan. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, 
 
 117

 148 

such Revolving L C Participant to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Revolving L C Participant such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Revolving L C Participant for such increased cost or reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that any Letter of Credit Issuer or a Revolving L C Participant shall not be entitled to such compensation as a result of such Person s compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any such Applicable Law as in effect on the Closing Date.

After any resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer s resignation or replacement as Letter of Credit Issuer, the provisions of this Agreement relating to a Letter of Credit Issuer shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it (A) while it was a Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement or (B) at any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer. 
 (b) To the extent that there are, at the time of any resignation or replacement as set forth in clause (a) above, any outstanding Letters of Credit, nothing herein shall be deemed to impact or impair any rights and obligations of any of the parties hereto with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit (including, without limitation, any obligations related to the payment of Fees or the reimbursement or funding of amounts drawn), except that the Borrower, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer and the successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall have the obligations regarding outstanding Letters of Credit described in clause (a) above.

None of the Letter of Credit Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective affiliates nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Letter of Credit Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Required Lenders (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Letter of Credit Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective affiliates nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Letter of Credit Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 3.3(d) provided that anything in such Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against a Letter of Credit Issuer, and such Letter of Credit Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such Letter of Credit Issuer s willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith or a material breach by such Letter of Credit Issuer of any Credit Document (as determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) or such Letter of Credit Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Letter of 
 
 150 

Credit Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no Letter of Credit Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

 151 

obligations to such Term Letter of Credit Issuer in respect of the Term Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Term Letter of Credit Issuer, and may transfer all or any portion of the funds in any Term C Loan Collateral Account to any other Term C Loan Collateral Account, subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set forth in this Section 3.9 (and each Term Letter of Credit Issuer and the Collateral Agent agrees to (or shall instruct the Collateral Trustee to) instruct the applicable Depositary Bank to transfer such funds at the discretion of the Borrower within one (1) Business Day after the Borrower has provided notice to make such transfer) provided that each Term Letter of Credit Issuer may require that the Depositary Bank for the Term C Loan Collateral Account corresponding to its Term L C Obligations is such Term Letter of Credit Issuer or an Affiliate thereof. The Borrower agrees that at all times, and shall immediately cause additional funds to be deposited and held in the Term C Loan Collateral Accounts from time to time in order that (A) the Term C Loan Collateral Account Balance for all Term C Loan Collateral Accounts shall at least equal the Term Letters of Credit Outstanding with respect to all Term Letters of Credit and (B) the Term C Loan Collateral Account Balance of each Term C Loan Collateral Account established for the benefit of a Term Letter of Credit Issuer shall equal at least the Term Letters of Credit Outstanding of such Term Letter of Credit Issuer (the Term L C Cash Coverage Requirement provided that in the case of clause (B), such requirement shall be deemed to have been met at such time if the Borrower shall have instructed that funds held in one Term C Loan Collateral Account be transferred to the Term C Loan Collateral Account established for the benefit of another Term Letter of Credit Issuer so long as after giving effect to such transfer, the Term L C Cash Coverage Requirement shall have been met. The Borrower hereby grants to the Collateral Representative, for the benefit of all Term Letter of Credit Issuers, a security interest in the Term C Loan Collateral Accounts and all cash and balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing, as security for the Term L C Obligations (including the Term Letter of Credit Reimbursement Obligations) (and, in addition, grants a security interest therein, for the benefit of the Secured Parties as collateral security for the RCT Reclamation Obligations and the other First Lien Obligations provided that amounts on deposit in any Term C Loan Collateral Account shall be applied, first, to repay the corresponding Term L C Obligations (including Term Letter of Credit Reimbursement Obligations) owing to the applicable Term Letter of Credit Issuer, second, to repay the Term L C Obligations in respect of all other Term Letters of Credit and, then, to repay the RCT Obligations and all other First Lien Obligations as provided in Section 11.12 ).

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to Sections 5.4(d) , 5.4(e) , 5.4(i) and 5.4(j) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(f) If any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of an Indemnified Tax (including an Other Tax) for which a payment of additional amounts or indemnification payments has been made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, then the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such amount (net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other than any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) as the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be the proportion of the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position (taking into account reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) imposed on the refund) than it would have been in if the payment had not been required provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in the event the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

Document 

Exhibit 95.1 
 
 Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
 Safety is a top priority in all our businesses, and accordingly, it is a key component of our focus on operational excellence, our employee performance reviews and employee compensation. Our health and safety program objectives are to prevent workplace accidents and ensure that all employees return home safely and comply with all regulations. 
 
 Vistra currently owns and operates, or is in the process of reclaiming, 12 surface lignite coal mines in Texas to provide fuel for its electricity generation facilities. Vistra also owns or leases, and is in the process of reclaiming, two waste-to-energy surface facilities in Pennsylvania. These mining operations are regulated by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the Mine Act), as well as other regulatory agencies such as the RCT. The MSHA inspects U.S. mines, including Vistra's, on a regular basis and if it believes a violation of the Mine Act or any health or safety standard or other regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation or order, generally accompanied by a proposed fine or assessment. Such citations and orders can be contested and appealed to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (FMSHRC), which often results in a reduction of the severity and amount of fines and assessments and sometimes results in dismissal. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size of the mine as well as other factors. 
 
 Disclosures related to specific mines pursuant to Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K sourced from data documented at October 11, 2024 in the MSHA Data Retrieval System for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (except pending legal actions, which are at September 30, 2024), are as follows
