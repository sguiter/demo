 CATALYST BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) full-service locations. The Company was incorporated by the Bank in February 2021 as part of the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization (the Conversion ). The Conversion was completed on October 12, 2021, at which time the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank and became the holding company for the Bank. Shares of the Company s common stock were issued and sold in an offering to certain depositors of the Bank and others. The Company was not engaged in operations and had not issued any shares of stock prior to the completion of the Conversion. As used in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms we, our, us, or the Company refer to Catalyst Bancorp, and the term the Bank refers to Catalyst Bank, the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, unless the context otherwise requires, references to the operations of the Company include the operations of the Bank. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the entire fiscal year. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain amounts reported in prior periods may have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported equity or net income. Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements During the three months ended June 30, 2024, it was discovered that the rate of interest paid on one interest-bearing checking account did not reconcile with the contract with the customer. The checking account is a public fund deposit with a negotiated arrangement managed by a lead financial institution that billed the Bank periodically for interest then owed to the municipality. The Bank is a party to the agreement with the municipality but participated in only a portion of the total funds deposited by the municipality and did not deal directly with the municipality with respect to the funds deposited or the interest paid. These responsibilities are handled indirectly through the lead institution. During June of 2024, the Bank became aware of the additional interest owed by it pursuant to the agreement. As a result of the error, of total interest expense was not properly accrued or paid by the Bank during the period beginning August 1, 2022 and ending March 31, 2024. In accordance with the guidance set forth in SEC Staff Bulletin 99, Materiality , and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 108, Considering Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financials , the Bank concluded that the error was not material to any prior periods, the current period or the trend in earnings from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. However, correcting the cumulative effect of the error in the current period would have resulted in a material misstatement in the current period. Accordingly, management revised the prior period financial statements, related disclosures, and supplemental information presented in this filing to correct the misstatement. We will also revise previously reported financial information for these immaterial errors in our future filings, as applicable. The Company s previously issued financial statements and related disclosures were not amended and can still be relied upon.

Management and the Audit Committee also assessed the error s impact on internal controls over financial reporting and did not identify any material weaknesses. For further information on Management s evaluation of the Company s internal controls, see Item 4 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could reflect materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Methodologies the Company uses when applying critical accounting policies and developing critical estimates are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our accounting policies for allowance for credit losses, investment securities, and income taxes comprise those that management believes involve the most critical estimates and aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the measurement of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities was identified as a critical accounting estimate. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. At September 30, 2024, the Company s net deferred tax asset totaled million and is included in other assets on the statement of financial condition. According to Subtopic 740-10 of the Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740-10 ), the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not

 and , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted one loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that resulted in a more than minor change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. The maturity date was extended by for a residential mortgage loan with a balance of . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not grant any loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that resulted in a more than minor change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. The Company was not committed to lend any additional funds to borrowers with modified terms and experiencing financial difficulty at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Loans are categorized by credit quality indicators based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Credit quality classifications follow regulatory guidelines and can generally be described as follows: Pass Loans in this category have strong asset quality and liquidity along with a multi-year track record of profitability. Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loss Loans classified as loss have been identified as uncollectible and are generally charged-off in the period identified. The information for each of the credit quality indicators is updated at least quarterly in conjunction with the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.

Overview Catalyst Bancorp, Inc. Catalyst Bancorp or the Company is the holding company for Catalyst Bank (the Bank ), formerly known as St. Landry Homestead Federal Savings Bank. The Company was incorporated by the Bank in February 2021 as part of the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization (the Conversion ). The Conversion was completed on October 12, 2021, at which time the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank, which became the wholly-owned subsidiary of Catalyst Bancorp. The Bank officially changed its name to Catalyst Bank in June 2022. Founded in 1922, the Bank is a community-oriented savings bank serving the banking needs of customers in the Acadiana region of south-central Louisiana. We are headquartered in Opelousas, Louisiana and serve our customers through six full-service branches located in Carencro, Eunice, Lafayette, Opelousas, and Port Barre. Our primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds together with funds we borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Dallas, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and other sources to originate loans to our customers and invest in securities.

 Historically, we operated as a traditional thrift relying on long-term, single-family residential mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in St. Landry Parish and adjoining areas to generate interest income. In 2021, we re-focused our business strategy to a relationship-based community bank model targeting small- to mid-sized businesses and business professionals in our market areas while continuing to serve our traditional customer base. The Conversion and offering were important factors in our efforts to become a more dynamic, profitable and growing institution. The following is an overview of financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: Total assets of 280.6 million at September 30, 2024, up 9.7 million, or 3.6 , from December 31, 2023 Loans of 165.9 million at September 30, 2024, up 21.0 million, or 14.5 , from December 31, 2023 Non-performing assets of 1.6 million at September 30, 2024, down 440,000, or 21.5 , from December 31, 2023 Investment securities of 45.6 million at September 30, 2024, down 38.4 million, or 45.7 , from December 31, 2023 Deposits of 167.4 million at September 30, 2024, up 1.8 million, or 1.1 , from December 31, 2023 Borrowings of 29.5 million at September 30, 2024, up 10.1 million, or 52.3 , from December 31, 2023 Total shareholders equity of 81.7 million at September 30, 2024, down 2.9 million, or 3.4 , from December 31, 2023 Net interest income of 2.5 million and net interest margin of 3.86 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 584,000, or 30.0 , and up 77 basis points bps ), respectively, compared to the same period in 2023 Net interest income of 7.1 million and net interest margin of 3.56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 1.3 million, or 22.8 , and up 52 bps, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023 Loss on the sales of investment securities of 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Non-interest expense of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 179,000, or 8.6 , compared to the same period in 2023 Non-interest expense of 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 662,000, or 10.3 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to expenses related to the Company s upgrade to a new core processing system Net income of 447,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 296,000, or 196.0 , compared to the same period in 2023 A net loss of 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 219,000 for the same period in 2023 
 Our results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Results of operations are also affected by our provisions for credit losses, fee income and other non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest expense principally consists of compensation, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, and other expense. Our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could reflect materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Methodologies the Company uses when applying critical accounting policies and developing critical estimates are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our accounting policies for allowance for credit losses, investment securities, and income taxes comprise those that management believes involve the most critical estimates and aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the measurement of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities was identified as a critical accounting estimate. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. At September 30, 2024, the Company s net deferred tax asset totaled 1.4 million and is included in other assets on the statement of financial condition. According to Subtopic 740-10 of the Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740-10 ), the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. At September 30, 2024, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets. Realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors. We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change, which may impact total income tax expense in future periods. Additionally, as discussed in detail in Note 1 to the Company s financial statements reported in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, during June of 2024, the Bank became aware of interest owed by it to a deposit customer that was not properly accrued or paid by the Bank during the period beginning August 1, 2022 and ending March 31, 2024. Accordingly, management revised the prior period financial statements, related disclosures and supplemental information presented in this filing to correct the misstatement. The Company will also revise previously reported financial information for these immaterial errors in its future filings, as applicable. The information in this Item 2 and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been adjusted to reflect these revisions as described in Note 1 to the Company s financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There were no other material changes from the significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In preparing the financial statements, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial condition, results of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature and include appropriate estimated provisions.

 Rate/Volume Analysis. The following tables show the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in rate, which is the change in rate multiplied by prior year volume, and (2) changes in volume, which is the change in volume multiplied by prior year rate. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.

The average loan yield was 6.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up from 5.45 for the same period in 2023. Average loans were 161.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 26.6 million, or 19.7 , compared to the same period in 2023. At September 30, 2024, approximately 50 of our total loans have adjustable rates and approximately 51 of total loans are scheduled to re-price or mature during the next 12 months. The decrease in interest income on investment securities was primarily due to the decrease in the average balance of total investment securities due to the sales executed during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The average rate earned on our investment securities portfolio was 2.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 47 basis points compared to the same period 2023 primarily due to investment securities purchased during 2024.

Our net interest margin was 3.86 and 3.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net interest margin and net interest income over the comparable periods was primarily the result of increased yields on our interest-earning assets, partially offset by the rising cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Provision for Credit Losses. The total provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments was 337,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to zero provision for the same period in 2023.

 months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to losses on the sales of investment securities. Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was up 662,000, or 10.3 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to expenses associated with the Company s upgrade to a new core processing system.

The average rate earned on our investment securities portfolio was 1.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 23 basis points compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to investment securities purchased during 2024. Interest income on other interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest-earning cash and deposits at other financial institutions, increased mainly due to the re-investment of proceeds from investment securities sales executed during the first three months of 2024.

Our net interest margin was 3.56 and 3.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net interest margin and net interest income over the comparable periods was primarily the result of increased yields on our interest-earning assets, partially offset by the rising cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Provision for Credit Losses. The total provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments was 531,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to no provision for the same period in 2023. In 2024, the provision for credit losses was largely attributable to commercial loan growth and an increase in the allowance for credit losses on individually evaluated loans. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was down 5.1 million compared to 917,000 for the same period in 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives. Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities or sales of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and our primary correspondent bank. At September 30, 2024, our borrowed funds consisted of a 20 million BTFP advance and FHLB advances with a total net carrying value of 9.5 million. The table below summarizes our unused and available liquidity sources as of September 30, 2024. 

(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas 43,237 Line of credit with primary correspondent bank 17,800 Unpledged available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value 10,634 Total unused and available liquidity 71,671 The Company also has a 25.0 million custodial letter of credit outstanding from the FHLB as of September 30, 2024, which is included in the calculation of our available capacity with the FHLB indicated above. The Company can allocate portions of this letter of credit to collateralize certain deposit balances in excess of the FDIC s insurance limit as an alternative to pledging investment securities for the same purpose. At September 30, 2024, the Company used 19.0 million of the FHLB custodial letter of credit to collateralize public fund deposits. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The most significant uses and sources of cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included: 46.4 million in proceeds from maturities, paydowns, and sales of investment securities, 21.5 million net outflow due to an increase in total loans, 10.0 million in proceeds from BTFP advances, and 7.9 million net outflow due to purchases of investment securities. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position daily and anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that the majority of maturing time deposits will be retained. We also anticipate continued use of our secondary funding sources.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES During the three months ended June 30, 2024, management identified a deficiency in the Company s system of internal controls which led to the misstatement described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. After implementing a process to resolve the deficiency and assess its cause and resulting impact on our disclosure controls and procedures, Management and the Audit Committee concluded that the deficiency did not represent a material weakness in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting since the deficiency was isolated to a unique deposit account that required certain controls that were not required for oversight of any other of the Bank s deposit accounts at June 30, 2024. Therefore, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of the date of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, other than the identified deficiency, were effective as of that date. The control deficiency was remediated in July 2024. An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act )) as of September 30, 2024, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of our senior management. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Except for the previously identified deficiency that was remediated in July 2024, there have been no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
