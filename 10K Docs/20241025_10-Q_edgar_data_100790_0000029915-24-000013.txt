Union Carbide Corporation and Subsidiaries 
 
 Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as otherwise indicated by the context, the terms "Corporation" or "UCC" as used herein mean Union Carbide Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements in this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements often address expected future business and financial performance, financial condition, and other matters, and often contain words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, opportunity, outlook, plan, project, seek, should, strategy, target, will, will be, will continue, will likely result, would and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words or phrases. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that are beyond the Corporation s control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements and speak only as of the date the statements were made. These factors include, but are not limited to: sales of UCC's products; UCC's expenses, future revenues and profitability; any global and regional economic impacts of a pandemic or other public health-related risks and events on the Corporation s business; any sanctions, export restrictions, supply chain disruptions or increased economic uncertainty related to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; capital requirements and need for and availability of financing; unexpected barriers in the development of technology, including with respect to UCC s contemplated capital and operating projects; significant litigation and environmental matters and related contingencies and unexpected expenses; the success of competing technologies that are or may become available; the ability to protect UCC's intellectual property in the United States and abroad; developments related to contemplated restructuring activities and proposed divestitures or acquisitions such as workforce reduction, manufacturing facility and/or asset closure and related exit and disposal activities, and the benefits and costs associated with each of the foregoing; fluctuations in energy and raw material prices; management of process safety and product stewardship; changes in public sentiment and political leadership; increased concerns about plastics in the environment and lack of a circular economy for plastics at scale; changes in consumer preferences and demand; changes in laws and regulations, political conditions or industry development; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, market uncertainty, interest and currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices; business, logistics, and supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; weather events and natural disasters; disruptions in the Corporation s information technology networks and systems, including the impact of cyberattacks; and, since The Dow Chemical Company ("TDCC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. (together, with TDCC and its consolidated subsidiaries, "Dow"), is the primary customer of UCC: Dow's ability to realize its commitment to carbon neutrality on the contemplated timeframe; the size of the markets for Dow s products and services and its ability to compete in such markets; Dow's failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; the rate and degree of market acceptance of Dow s products; and changes in relationships with Dow s significant customers and suppliers. 
 
 Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. A detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled "Risk Factors" contained in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Corporation faces. There may be other risks and uncertainties that the Corporation is unable to identify at this time or that it does not currently expect to have a material impact on its business. If any of those risks or uncertainties develops into an actual event, it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s business. The Corporation assumes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by securities and other applicable laws.

 to days. The vendor negotiates the terms of the agreements directly with the financial intermediary and the Corporation is not a party to that agreement. The financial intermediary may allow the participating vendor to utilize TDCC's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which may provide the vendor with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither TDCC nor the Corporation provide guarantees related to the SCF program. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under the SCF program were million million at December 31, 2023), included in Accounts payable Trade in the consolidated balance sheets.

 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs million at December 31, 2023), including million for the remediation of Superfund sites million at December 31, 2023). This is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Corporation has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Corporation's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Corporation s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Corporation s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. As new or additional information becomes available and/or certain spending trends become known, management will evaluate such information in determination of the current estimate of the environmental liability. 
 
 Litigation 
 Asbestos-Related Matters 
 Each quarter, the Corporation reviews asbestos-related claims filed, settled and dismissed, as well as average settlement and resolution costs by disease category. The Corporation also considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as the nature of pending claims, trial experience of the Corporation and other asbestos defendants, current spending for defense and processing costs, significant appellate rulings and legislative developments, trends in the tort system, and their respective effects on expected future resolution costs. UCC management considers these factors in conjunction with the most recent actuarial study and determines whether a change in the estimate is warranted. Based on the Corporation's review of 2024 activity, it was determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Corporation s total asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims and defense and processing costs was million at September 30, 2024 million at December 31, 2023). At September 30, 2024, approximately percent of the recorded claim liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims.

 1. In the fourth quarter of 2023, UCC divested certain non-product producing infrastructure assets to another TDCC subsidiary ("Infrastructure Divestment"), resulting in an increase in activity-based costs, as certain site infrastructure-related costs previously administered independently by the Corporation are now performed by another TDCC subsidiary and billed to the Corporation. The Infrastructure Divestment also resulted in certain changes in other cost flows, which also resulted in increased activity-based costs. Activity-based costs include short-term lease cost of million and million related to pipeline and site services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, included in Lease Cost in Note 8. 
 2. Period-end balances on hand are included in inventory. The decrease in purchase costs was primarily due to lower feedstock costs and the changes in cost flows resulting from the Infrastructure Divestment. 

Additionally, the Corporation experienced an unplanned shutdown of its manufacturing site in Seadrift, Texas, in October 2023, resulting in lost sales and margins in the fourth quarter of 2023. These losses are covered, in part, by an insurance program purchased by TDCC from its insurance affiliate, which is included in the Corporation's master services agreement with TDCC. In the first quarter of 2024, the Corporation recorded insurance recoveries of million from TDCC for covered losses, which is included in "Cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

These amounts were reclassified from "Income taxes receivable" and settled through the Corporation's cash management process with TDCC and are reflected in "Related company receivables" and "Other assets and liabilities" in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Pursuant to General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) for Form 10-Q "Omission of Information by Certain Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries," the Corporation is filing this Form 10-Q with a reduced disclosure format. 
 
 References to "TDCC" refer to The Dow Chemical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated by the context. Union Carbide Corporation (the "Corporation" or "UCC") has been a wholly owned subsidiary of TDCC since 2001. TDCC has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. since 2019. 
 
 TDCC conducts its worldwide operations through global businesses. UCC's business activities comprise components of TDCC s global businesses rather than stand-alone operations. Because there are no separate reportable business segments for UCC and no detailed business information is provided to a chief operating decision maker regarding the Corporation s stand-alone operations, the Corporation s results are reported as a single operating segment. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Sales 
 Total net sales were 3,253 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 3,378 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 4 percent. Net sales to related companies, principally to TDCC, were 3,166 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 3,284 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 4 percent. Selling prices to TDCC are determined in accordance with the terms of an agreement between UCC and TDCC. 
 
 Average selling price for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 10 percent compared with the first nine months of 2023. Price decreased in most product lines in response to lower raw material and feedstock costs, with the most significant decreases in plastics used for wire and cable applications, vinyl acetate monomers and oxo alcohols. Volume for the first nine months of 2024 increased 6 percent compared with the first nine months of 2023. Volume increased in most product lines, with the most significant increases in polyethylene, vinyl acetate monomers, plastics used for wire and cable applications, oxo alcohols and glycol ethers, partially offset by volume decreases in ethylene oxide and ethanolamines. Volume increases were primarily due to increased demand, improved internal and external raw material supply availability and decreased impact of planned maintenance turnaround activity for certain products compared with 2023. Ethylene oxide volume for the first nine months of 2024 was negatively impacted by lost production due to a freeze event and a steam outage in the first quarter of 2024, planned 
 15 

Table of Contents 

maintenance turnaround activity in the second quarter of 2024 and the proactive response to hurricane threats in the third quarter of 2024. Volume for ethanolamines for the first nine months of 2024 was negatively impacted by downtime due to planned maintenance turnaround activity in the third quarter of 2024, which was extended due to equipment failures and other unplanned maintenance; and raw material, power and steam limitations. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales was 3,000 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2,913 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 3 percent. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 92.2 percent for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 86.2 percent for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Cost of sales exceeded net sales in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased spending on planned maintenance turnaround activities; spending for unplanned events, including equipment failure, additional discovery during planned maintenance turnaround activities, and preparation, start-up and recovery from hurricane threats and impacts; and a one-time materials disposal charge related to a divested business. These factors that impacted operations also negatively impacted sales volume for the quarter, resulting in reduced overall sales margins. 
 
 Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Corporation recorded pretax restructuring charges of 14 million, included in "Restructuring and asset related charges - net" in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Corporation's restructuring activities and related charges. 
 
 The Corporation expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities. Future costs are expected to include demolition costs related to closed facilities and restructuring plan implementation costs; these costs will be recognized as incurred. The Corporation also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits, related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 
 Sundry Income (Expense) Net 
 Sundry income (expense) net includes a variety of income and expense items such as charges for management services provided by TDCC, non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit plan credits or costs, commissions and gains and losses on sales of investments and assets and on foreign currency exchange. 
 
 Sundry income (expense) net in the first nine months of 2024 was expense of 70 million compared with 67 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily the result of higher non-operating defined benefit pension costs resulting from lower expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by lower benefit interest costs. The increase in non-operating pension costs was partially offset by a decrease in charges for services provided by TDCC and a 2 million gain on the sale of the Corporation's ownership interest in a TDCC joint venture to a TDCC subsidiary. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Corporation's service agreements with TDCC. 
 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 104 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 30 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in interest income primarily resulted from interest earned on a term loan receivable from a related party, received on December 1, 2023, in exchange for UCC's interest in a TDCC subsidiary that manages certain site infrastructure assets for UCC and TDCC on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount 
 Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was 7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 13 million in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting reduced interest expense resulting from the maturity and payment of 129 million of long-term debt in April 2023. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Corporation is subject primarily to U.S. federal and state taxes. For the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation reported a tax provision of 55 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.2 percent compared with a tax provision of 79 million for the first nine months of 2023, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.0 percent.

 Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 were 262 million compared with 203 million in the first nine months of 2023, as the Corporation continues to invest in production assets, primarily on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
 
 Pension Plans 
 As announced in 2021, UCC s pension plans were frozen for substantially all employees who participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension programs effective December 31, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation spun off a portion of its existing tax-qualified U.S defined benefit pension plan into a new tax-qualified pension plan, which inclu des the tax-qualified benefit obligations for substantially all employees hired after January 1, 2008. These employees earned benefits based on a set percentage of annual pay, plus interest, and the spin of this plan provides the Corporation the ability to separately manage the assets and obligations of plans with like benefits. In the second quarter of 2024, as part of its ongoing pension de-risking initiatives, the Corporation initiated the termination of the new tax-qualified pension plan. As part of the plan termination process, the Corporation will offer participants of this plan annuity or lump sum distribution options. Final asset distributions are expected to be paid from plan assets in the fourth quarter of 2025, with minimal additional funding, if any, required from the Corporation, and are anticipated to result in pension settlement charges, with the amounts dependent on various factors, including interest rates, plan asset returns, annuity pricing and participant distribution elections. 
 
 See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K for additional information related to the Corporation s pension plans. 

OTHER MATTERS 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Corporation s critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 10-K. Since December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes in the Corporation s accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates. 
 
 Asbestos-Related Matters 
 The Corporation is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that UCC sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on UCC s premises, and UCC s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former UCC subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. ("Amchem"). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to UCC s products. 
 
 The table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against the Corporation and Amchem based on criteria developed by UCC and its external consultants: 
 
 Asbestos-Related Claim Activity 2024 2023 Claims unresolved at Jan 1 6,367 6,873 Claims filed 3,472 3,097 Claims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved (4,469) (3,428) Claims unresolved at Sep 30 5,370 6,542 Claimants with claims against both UCC and Amchem (963) (1,452) Individual claimants at Sep 30 4,407 5,090 
 17 

Table of Contents 

Plaintiffs' lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to UCC, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. For these reasons and based upon the Corporation's litigation and settlement experience, the Corporation does not consider the damages alleged against it and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability. 
 
 For additional information, see Asbestos-Related Matters in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings; and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K. 
 
 Debt Covenants and Default Provisions 
 The Corporation s outstanding public debt has been issued under indentures which contain, among other provisions, covenants that the Corporation must comply with while the underlying notes are outstanding. Such covenants are typically based on the Corporation s size and financial position and include, subject to the exceptions and qualifications contained in the indentures, obligations not to (i) allow liens on principal U.S. manufacturing facilities, (ii) enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to principal U.S. manufacturing facilities, or (iii) merge into or consolidate with any other entity or sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets. Failure of the Corporation to comply with any of these covenants could, after the passage of any applicable grace period, result in a default under the applicable indenture which would allow the note holders to accelerate the due date of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the subject notes. Management believes the Corporation was in compliance with the covenants referred to above at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Dividends 
 On a quarterly basis, the Corporation's Board of Directors ("the Board") reviews and determines if there will be a dividend distribution to its parent company and sole shareholder, TDCC. The Board takes into consideration the level of earnings and cash flows, among other factors, in determining the amount of the dividend distribution. For the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation declared and paid cash dividends of 228 million to TDCC 394 million for the first nine months of 2023). 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Omitted pursuant to General Instruction H of Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation's Disclosure Committee and the Corporation's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that was conducted during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.
