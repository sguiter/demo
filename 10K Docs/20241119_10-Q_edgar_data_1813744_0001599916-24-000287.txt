Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate
their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization. 

ASC
820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an
entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

-
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets
or liabilities. 

 -
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest
rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

 -
Level 3 Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

, a decrease of (-9 as compared to working capital of as
of October 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company recorded cash and cash equivalents of , a decrease of as compared to
 in the prior year ended October 31, 2023. The Company s decreased liquidity as compared to prior year is due to
a nearly 6 million increase in advance payments and prepaid expenses. As stated in the consolidated financial statements, the Company,
for the period ended January 31, 2024, recorded a net loss of (-115.24 y-o-y) and used (+3.80 y-o-y) in cash
flows from operating activities, as compared to the same period in 2023. The change in net profit(loss), use of cash from operations,
and decrease in working capital is mainly related to increased advance payments and prepaid expenses and decrease in revenue. 

Having
reviewed the above, the Company realizes that whether we should be able to continue the positive trends demonstrated in our previous financial
statements lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated
financial statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal
course of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s)
in the future and procure any required funds needed to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated the estimated
impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will
need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of
COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales, which is currently the Company s
primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically,
as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this
time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation and considering the positive financials trends the Company has experienced for many previous quarters,
management believes that the one-time R D expense this quarter will not adversely impact the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern (see Note 8). 

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

Japan 

The Company
conducts its major businesses in Japan through WSP Japan and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities,
the Company files tax returns that are subject to examination by the local tax authority. 

The realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in future periods. The
Company regularly assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including
its earnings history and results of recent operations, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. 

The amount of
the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward
period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional
weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company s projections for growth. The adjustments of a valuation allowance
against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in the effective tax rate in the periods in which the valuation allowance is
adjusted. For the year ended October 31, 2021, a full valuation allowance was provided. For the year ended October 31, 2022, certain valuation
allowance was released for WSP Japan considering the collectability of deferred tax assets. 

As of

Lease ROU assets
and liabilities are recognized at commencement date of the lease, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The
lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. When readily determinable, we use the implicit
rate in determining the present value of lease payments. When leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including the lease term.

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives,
and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These
forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, 
 will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar
expressions. 

Forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies
is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis
include but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates,
competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking
statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

Mr. Uetaki gifted to the Company, at no cost, 300 shares of common stock of World Scan Project Corporation, a Japan corporation WSP

WSP

On
February 19, 2020, Ryohei Uetaki gifted 7,000,000 shares of our Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which

In

647,350 shares of common stock in total to these shareholders and received 323,675 as aggregate consideration. At the time of purchase
the price paid per share by each shareholder was the equivalent of about 0.50 USD. 

These
shares were sold pursuant to the Company s effective S-1 Registration Statement deemed effective on August 28, 2020 at 4pm EST. 

We
operate through our wholly owned subsidiary, World Scan Project Corporation, a Japanese Company. The Company is an industrial automation
equipment manufacturer, designing/developing robots, drones, Web3 infrastructure, IoT equipment and other related products. 

Our
principal executive offices are located at 2-18-23, Nishiwaseda, Shinjuku-Ku, Tokyo, 169-0051, Japan. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As of January 31, 2024 we
had cash and cash balance in the amount of 767,210. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations without the need
for additional funding. 

Revenues 

We
recorded revenues of 6,635,195 for the three months ended January 31, 2024. We recorded revenues of 7,743,164 for the three months ended
January 31, 2023. 

Net
Income 

We
recorded a net loss of 308,261 for the three months ended January 31, 2024. We recorded a net income of 2,022,241 for the three months
ended January 31, 2023. 

Cash
flow 

For
the three months ended January 31, 2024, we had negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of 10,519,502. The decrease in operating
cash flow is attributed to prepaid manufacturing services during this period and the decrease in net income. For the three months ended
January 31, 2024, we had negative cash flows used investing activities. This decrease in cash flows it attributed the purchase of fixed
and long term intangible assets. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, we no cash flows financing activities totaling 5,832,000
due to receipts of deposits for share subscriptions prior to registration. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern
that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
Company demonstrates some mixed trends, compared with the previous fiscal years, in our financial statements as in below: 

As
of January 31, 2024, the Company recorded cash and cash equivalents of 767,210, a decrease of 783,343 as compared to 1,550,553 in the
prior year period ended January 31, 2023. For the period ended, the Company s major sources of liquidity is derived from product
sales. The main cause of the decrease in cash from October 31, 2023 to January 31, 2024 is due to the working capital, which is an increase
in advance payments and prepaid expenses by approximately 6M. The balance mainly consists of advance payments for drone production and
cryptocurrency miners. As stated in the consolidated financial statements for the period ended on January 31, 2024, the Company recorded
a loss of 308,261 (-115.24 y-o-y) and used 10,519,502 (-115.88 y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. As a result, the Company s
working capital was reduced to approximately 6 million compared to October 31, 2023 working capital of approximately 6.6 million. 

Having reviewed the above, the Company
realizes that whether we shall be able to continue demonstrating the positive trends demonstrated in our previous financial statements,
lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated financial
statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal course
of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s)
in the future and procure any required funds needed to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated the estimated
impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will
need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of
COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales, which is currently the Company s
primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically,
as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this
time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based on the
Company s evaluation and considering the positive financials trends the Company has experienced for many previous quarters, management
believes that the 9 reduction in working capital this quarter will not adversely impact the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. 

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
chief executive officer and our chief financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer
and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of January 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, with the participation of our
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to material
weaknesses identified below. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls,
lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of an audit
committee. These material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer in
connection with the above evaluation. 

Inherent
limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for
advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization,
and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject
to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented
by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024,
that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
