Going Concern The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of (7,871,228), and an accumulated deficit of 82,044,527. The Company has not yet generated any significant revenues, and has incurred net losses since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve-month period since the date of the financial statements were issued. The Company believes that its current cash on hand will not be sufficient to fund its projected operating requirements for the next twelve months since the date of the issuance of the financial statements. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of its common stock in order to implement the Company s business plan or by using outside financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these situations in order to continue as a going concern. The Company is funding its operations by additional borrowings and some shareholder advances. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to an investment in its securities. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies, estimates and judgments that management believes are most significant in the application of GAAP used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These accounting policies, among others, may involve a high degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Further, these estimates and other factors, including those outside of our control could have significant adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 46 Table of Contents Income taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Refer to Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Loss contingencies Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. Refer to Note 18 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Research and development costs The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ASC 730-10 ). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. Refer to Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses identified to date include (i) policies and procedures which are not yet adequately documented. We retain a third party with relevant expertise to support us and assist us in enhancing our policies and procedures, (ii) insufficient GAAP experience regarding complex transactions and reporting, and (iii) an insufficient number of staff to maintain optimal segregation of duties and levels of oversight resulting from our small size and testing of the operating effectiveness of the controls. As of September 30, 2024, based on evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this quarterly report. Changes in Internal Controls There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 47 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
