Forward-looking Statements 
 Certain of the statements contained herein are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates, intends, plans, seeks, believes, estimates, expects, projects, and similar references to future periods. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding future economic, competitive, legislative and other developments and their potential effect upon The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "The Hartford"). Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from expectations depending on the evolution of various factors, including the risks and uncertainties identified below, as well as factors described in such forward-looking statements, the Risk Factors of The Hartford's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Risks Relating to Economic, Political and Global Market Conditions: 
 challenges related to the Company s current operating environment, including global political, economic and market conditions, and the effect of financial market disruptions, economic downturns, changes in trade regulation including tariffs and other barriers or other potentially adverse macroeconomic developments on the demand for our products and returns in our investment portfolios; 
 market risks associated with our business, including changes in credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, inflation rate, foreign currency exchange rates and market volatility; 
 the impact on our investment portfolio if our investment portfolio is concentrated in any particular segment of the economy; 
 the impacts of changing climate and weather patterns on our businesses, operations and investment portfolio including on claims, demand and pricing of our products, the availability and cost of reinsurance, our modeling data used to evaluate and manage risks of catastrophes and severe weather events, the value of our investment portfolios and credit risk with reinsurers and other counterparties; 
 Insurance Industry and Product-Related Risks: 
 the possibility of unfavorable loss development, including with respect to long-tailed exposures; 
 the significant uncertainties that limit our ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for asbestos and environmental claims; 
 the possibility of a pandemic, civil unrest, earthquake, or other natural or man-made disaster that may adversely affect our businesses; 
 weather and other natural physical events, including the intensity and frequency of thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, wildfires, flooding, winter storms, hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as climate change and its potential impact on weather patterns; 
 the possible occurrence of terrorist attacks and the Company s inability to contain its exposure as a result of, among other factors, the inability to exclude coverage for terrorist attacks from workers' compensation policies and limitations on reinsurance coverage from the federal government under applicable laws; 
 the Company s ability to effectively price its products and policies, including its ability to obtain regulatory consents to pricing actions or to non-renewal or withdrawal of certain product lines; 
 actions by competitors that may be larger or have greater financial resources than we do; 
 technological changes, including usage-based methods of determining premiums, advancements in certain emerging technologies, including machine learning, predictive analytics, big data analysis or other artificial intelligence functions, advancements in automotive safety features, the development of autonomous vehicles, and platforms that facilitate ride sharing; 
 the Company's ability to market, distribute and provide insurance products and investment advisory services through current and future distribution channels and advisory firms; 
 the uncertain effects of emerging claim and coverage issues; 
 political instability, politically motivated violence or civil unrest, which may increase the frequency and severity of insured losses; 
 the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including exposure to COVID-19 business interruption property claims and the possibility of a resurgence of COVID-19 related losses in Group Benefits; 
 Financial Strength, Credit and Counterparty Risks: 
 risks to our business, financial position, prospects and results associated with negative rating actions or downgrades in the Company s financial strength and credit ratings or negative rating actions or downgrades relating to our investments; 
 capital requirements which are subject to many factors, including many that are outside the Company s control, such as National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") risk based capital formulas, rating agency capital models, Funds at Lloyd's 
 4 

and Solvency Capital Requirement, which can in turn affect our credit and financial strength ratings, cost of capital, regulatory compliance and other aspects of our business and results; 
 losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including credit risk with counterparties associated with investments, derivatives, premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and indemnifications provided by third parties in connection with previous dispositions; 
 the potential for losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance to protect the Company against losses; 
 state and international regulatory limitations on the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends; 
 Risks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations: 
 risks associated with the use of analytical models in making decisions in key areas such as underwriting, pricing, capital management, reserving, investments, reinsurance and catastrophe risk management; 
 the potential for differing interpretations of the methodologies, estimations and assumptions that underlie the Company s fair value estimates for its investments and the evaluation of intent-to-sell impairments and allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities and mortgage loans; 
 the potential for impairments of our goodwill; 
 Strategic and Operational Risks: 
 the Company s ability to maintain the availability of its systems and safeguard the security of its data in the event of a disaster, cyber or other information security incident or other unanticipated event; 
 the potential for difficulties arising from outsourcing and similar third-party relationships; 
 the risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with capital management plans, expense reduction initiatives and other actions; 
 risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures, including the challenges of integrating acquired companies or businesses, which may result in our inability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies and may result in unintended consequences; 
 difficulty in attracting and retaining talented and qualified personnel, including key employees, such as executives, managers and employees with strong technological, analytical and other specialized skills; 
 the Company s ability to protect its intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement; 
 Regulatory and Legal Risks: 
 the cost and other potential effects of increased federal, state and international regulatory and legislative developments, including those that could adversely impact the demand for the Company s products, operating costs and required capital levels; 
 unfavorable judicial or legislative developments; 
 the impact of changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws; 
 regulatory requirements that could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests; and 
 the impact of potential changes in accounting principles and related financial reporting requirements. 
 Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this document speaks only as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. Factors or events that could cause the Company s actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. 
 Hartford, Connecticut 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), and changes in stockholders' equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding a change in accounting principle for the measurement and disclosure of long-duration contracts issued by insurance companies. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 and less than , respectively. 
 The table above excludes certain securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. As of September 30, 2024, significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.

 Estimated maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions. Due to the potential for variability in payment speeds (i.e., prepayments or extensions), mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are not categorized by contractual maturity. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 The Company aims to maintain a diversified investment portfolio including issuer, sector and geographic stratification, where 

applicable, and has established certain exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures to mitigate credit risk. The Company had investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10 of the Company's stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 other than U.S. government securities and certain U.S. government agencies.

 As of September 30, 2024, fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position consisted of instruments and were primarily depressed due to higher interest rates and/or wider credit spreads since the purchase date. As of September 30, 2024, of these fixed maturities were depressed less than 20 of cost or amortized cost. The decrease in unrealized losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. 
 Most of the fixed maturities depressed for twelve months or more relate to the corporate sector, RMBS, municipal bonds, and CMBS, which were primarily depressed because current rates are higher and/or market spreads are wider than at the respective purchase dates. The Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the fixed maturities outlined in the preceding discussion. The decision to record credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS in the form of an ACL requires us to make qualitative and quantitative estimates of expected future cash flows. 

Mortgage Loans 
 ACL on Mortgage Loans 
 The Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to estimate the ACL with changes in the ACL recorded in net realized gains and losses. Apart from an ACL recorded on individual mortgage loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company records an ACL on the pool of mortgage loans based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Company utilizes a third-party forecasting model to estimate lifetime expected credit losses at a loan level under multiple economic scenarios. The scenarios use macroeconomic data provided by an internationally recognized economics firm that generates forecasts of varying economic factors such as GDP growth, unemployment and interest rates. The economic scenarios are projected over 10 years. The first two to four years of the 10-year period assume a specific modeled economic scenario (including moderate upside, moderate recession and severe recession scenarios) and then revert to historical long-term assumptions over the remaining period. Using these economic scenarios, the forecasting model projects property-specific operating income and capitalization rates used

LTV ratios compare the loan amount to the value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan with property values based on appraisals updated no less than annually. Factors considered in estimating property values include, among other things, actual and expected property cash flows, geographic market data and the ratio of the property's net operating income to its value. DSCR compares a property s net operating income to the borrower s principal and interest payments and are updated no less than annually through reviews of underlying properties.

 t hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary. 
 Non-Consolidated VIEs 
 The Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company s maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was limited to the total carrying value of billion and billion, respectively, which are a portion of the investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets that are primarily recorded using the equity method of accounting. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling billion and billion, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management. For further discussion of these investments, see Equity Method Investments within Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 Furthermore, the Company makes investments in entities that sponsor affordable housing projects. Similarly, for these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the 

investments. The Company applies the proportional amortization method to subsequently measure its investments in such qualified affordable housing projects, where costs are amortized over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized amortization of and , respectively, and related tax benefits of and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized amortization of and less than , respectively, and related tax benefits of less than for both periods. The income tax credits and other income tax benefits are recognized in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has outstanding commitments related to affordable housing projects of and , respectively, that are contingent on various conditions precedent to funding. 
 In addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CLOs, CMBS, and RMBS and are reported in fixed maturities, AFS, and FVO securities on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the Company s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs, and, where applicable, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits. The Company s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company s investment. 
 Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Other Collateral Transactions and Restricted Investments 
 Reverse Repurchase Agreements 
 From time to time, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements where the Company purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same or substantially the same securities. The maturity of these transactions is generally within one year. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred to the Company under specified conditions and the Company has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities received. The Company accounts for reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reported and , respectively, within short-term investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets representing a

 Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates. 
 Non-qualifying Strategies 
 Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting non-qualifying strategies primarily include hedges of interest rate, foreign currency, equity, and commodity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities. In addition, hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include: 
 Credit Contracts 
 Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty or the Company should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. The Company also enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.

 As of September 30, 2024, the before tax deferred net losses on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are . This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities and long-term debt that will occur over the next twelve months. At that time, the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to net investment income or interest expense, as applicable, over the term of the hedged instrument cash flows. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.

 Credit Risk Assumed through Credit Derivatives 
 The Company enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk of a single entity or referenced index in order to synthetically replicate investment transactions that are permissible under the Company's investment policies. The Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security issuer s debt obligation after the occurrence of the credit event. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The 

credit default swaps in which the Company assumes credit risk may reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include standard diversified portfolios of corporate and CMBS issuers.

 Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods. Premiums receivable and agents' balances, excluding receivables for loss sensitive business, are primarily comprised of premiums due from policyholders, which are typically collectible within one year or less. For these balances, the ACL is estimated based on an aging of receivables and recent historical credit loss and collection experience, adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when appropriate. 

A portion of the Company's Commercial Lines business is written with large deductibles or under retrospectively-rated plans (referred to as "loss sensitive business"). Under some commercial insurance contracts with a large deductible, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim and the Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. As such, the Company is subject to credit risk until reimbursement is made. Retrospectively-rated policies are utilized primarily for workers' compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is adjusted based on actual losses incurred. Although the premium adjustment feature of a retrospectively-rated policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it presents credit risk to the Company. The Company s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such policyholders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the amount of additional premium owed under retrospectively-rated policies. The Company manages these credit risks through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and oversight. 
 The ACL for receivables for loss sensitive business is estimated as the amount of the receivable exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each policyholder's credit rating, or a rating is estimated if no external rating is available. Credit ratings are reviewed and updated at least annually. The exposure amount is estimated net of collateral and other credit enhancement, considering the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, and historical loss information for the type of collateral obtained. The probability of default factors are historical corporate defaults for receivables with similar durations estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The loss given default factors are based on a study of historical recovery rates for general creditors through multiple economic cycles. The Company's evaluation of the required ACL for receivables for loss sensitive business considers the current economic environment as well as the probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used for estimating the ACL for mortgage loans.

 Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods, generally 30, 60 or 90 days. To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and 

operational quality of each potential reinsurer. In placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.

 Re-estimates of prior accident year reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Workers compensation reserves were decreased within the 2016 to 2020 accident years primarily in small commercial, driven by lower than previously estimated claim severity. In addition, the 2020 accident year includes a reduction of COVID-19 related reserves driven by favorable claim count emergence. 
 General liability reserves were increased primarily in response to higher frequency of large losses in the 2016 to 2019 accident years as well as increases in more recent accident years, with the increase in reserves for the three months ended September 30, 2024, focused more toward the recent accident years. In addition, reserves for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims were increased for older accident years. Lastly, reserves for extra contractual liability claims and other miscellaneous run-off lines were reduced in response to recent favorable loss activity. 

Professional liability reserves decreased modestly due to favorable development on directors' and officers' ("D O") claims driven by the 2020 to 2022 accident years, partially offset by deterioration in older accident years. 
 Bond reserves decreased due to favorable development on commercial and contract surety driven by accident years 2019 and prior. 
 Assumed reinsurance reserves were increased due to higher reserve estimates in the Latin America surety and Latin America P C businesses related to the 2020 to 2023 accident years. 
 Automobile liability reserves - Commercial Lines increased primarily due to adverse loss development within accident years 2022 and 2023 driven by higher severity than estimated. 
 Automobile liability reserves - Personal Lines were decreased primarily in response to better than anticipated accident year 2023 claim severity for property damage liability. 
 Homeowners reserves were decreased primarily due to favorable severity impacting accident year 2023. 
 Catastrophes reserves were decreased primarily within Commercial Lines driven by a reduction in reserves in accident years 2021 to 2022 related to favorable emergence related to various hail events, as well as favorable development in accident year 2022 related to Hurricane Ian. 
 Other reserve re-estimates, net, included a decrease in reserves due to lower severity than expected on Personal Lines automobile physical damage for accident year 2023, offset by an increase in reserves related to unfavorable development from participation in involuntary market pools. 
 Re-estimates of prior accident year reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Workers compensation reserves were decreased within the 2014 to 2019 accident years primarily in small commercial, driven by lower than previously estimated claim severity. In addition, the 2020 accident year reflects a reduction of COVID-19 related reserves. 
 General liability reserves were increased driven by higher frequency and estimated cost to settle large individual claims for the 2016 to 2019 accident years, partially offset by a decrease in reserves for the 2020 accident year due to favorable experience. In addition, reserves for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims were increased for older accident years. Also included was a decrease in reserves for extra contractual liability claims and other miscellaneous run-off lines. 
 Package business reserves decreased primarily due to lower than previously estimated property severity for accident year 2019 and 2021. Package liability is flat overall with reserve increases related to higher severity across multiple accident years offset by improvement in accident year 2020 due to favorable claim count emergence.

Settlement Agreement with Boy Scouts of America 
 On February 14, 2022, the Company executed a final settlement agreement (the Settlement with the Boy Scouts of America BSA ), the Local Councils, and the attorneys representing a majority of the alleged victims, pursuant to which The Hartford agreed to pay for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims associated with liability policies issued by various Hartford Writing Companies in the 1970s and early 1980s. In exchange for its payment, the Company receives a complete release of its policies issued to BSA and the Local Councils, as well as an injunction against further abuse claims involving BSA. All conditions precedent to the Settlement have been satisfied, including approval by the bankruptcy court and the district court, and on April 20, 2023, The Hartford paid the Settlement amount of . Certain objecting parties have appealed the district court s ruling and that appeal is pending before the Third Circuit. If the court approvals for the BSA s plan of reorganization are not affirmed on appeal, it is possible that adverse outcomes, if any, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results.

 Litigation 
 The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties related to sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims, including those discussed in Note 9 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of this Form 10-Q and in Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in the following discussion under the caption COVID-19 Pandemic Business Income Insurance Litigation and under the caption Run-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims, management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford. 
 The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. In addition to the matter described below, these actions include putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper sales or underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile and property. The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims or other allegedly unfair or improper business practices. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic Business Income Insurance Litigation 
 Like many others in the property and casualty insurance industry, beginning in April 2020, various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company (collectively the "Hartford Writing Companies ), and in some instances the Company itself, were named as defendants in lawsuits seeking insurance coverage 

under commercial insurance policies issued by the Hartford Writing Companies for alleged losses resulting from the shutdown or suspension of their businesses due to the spread of COVID-19. More than 300 such lawsuits were filed, including numerous lawsuits purportedly filed on behalf of broad nationwide or statewide classes of policyholders. Although the allegations vary, the plaintiffs generally seek a declaration of insurance coverage, damages for breach of contract in unspecified amounts, interest, and attorneys' fees. Many of the lawsuits also allege that the insurance claims were denied in bad faith or otherwise in violation of state laws and seek extra-contractual or punitive damages. Some of the lawsuits also allege that the Hartford Writing Companies engaged in unfair business practices by collecting or retaining excess premium. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries deny the allegations and maintain that based on the terms of the applicable insurance policies, they have no coverage obligations with respect to these suits for business income allegedly lost by the plaintiffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the policies generally require direct physical loss or damage to insured property and/or contain exclusions for any loss caused directly or indirectly by the presence, growth, proliferation, spread or activity of a virus, subject to a narrow set of exceptions not applicable in connection with this pandemic, and which often contain a pollution and contamination exclusion that, among other things, expressly excludes from coverage any loss caused by material that threatens human health or welfare. 
 The Company has obtained numerous dismissals in its favor and affirmances on appeal and continues to vigorously defend the remaining suits in the trial and appellate courts. Nevertheless, given the inherent difficulty in predicting litigation outcomes, the COVID-19 pandemic business income coverage lawsuits still present uncertainties and contingencies that are not yet fully known, including whether additional claims or lawsuits could be filed, the extent to which any state or nationwide classes will be certified, and the size and scope of any such classes. In addition, business income calculations depend upon a wide range of factors that are particular to the circumstances of each individual policyholder and, here, almost none of the plaintiffs have submitted proofs of loss or otherwise quantified or factually supported any allegedly covered loss to allow management to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any. Thus, despite the high percentage of favorable outcomes to date in both the trial and appellate courts, given the lack of certainty around the remaining lawsuits, the indeterminate amounts sought, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that adverse outcomes, if any, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated operating results or liquidity.

 of net A E reserves, including the benefit of losses ceded to an A E ADC with NICO (collectively the "A E ADC"). In addition, the Company has recorded a deferred gain within other liabilities for losses economically ceded to NICO but for which the benefit is not recognized in earnings until later periods. While the Company believes that its current Run-off A E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit our ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not reasonably estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results or liquidity. 
 The Company s A E ADC reinsurance agreement reinsures substantially all A E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years, including Run-off A E and A E reserves included in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The A E ADC has a coverage limit of billion above the Company s existing net A E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately billion. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has incurred in cumulative adverse development on A E reserves that have been ceded under the A E ADC treaty, leaving of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any.

Based on derivative contractual terms as of September 30, 2024, a downgrade of the current financial strength ratings by either Moody's or S P would t require additional assets to be posted as collateral. This requirement could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.

 Item 2. 
 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (Dollar amounts in millions except for per share data, unless otherwise stated) 
 The Hartford provides projections and other forward-looking information in the following discussions, which contain many forward-looking statements, particularly relating to the Company s future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the Company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to the cautionary statements set forth on pages 4 and 5 of this Form 10-Q. Actual results are likely to differ, and in the past have differed, materially from those forecast by the Company, depending on the outcome of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the following discussion; Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in The Hartford s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report; and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Hartford undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. 
 The Hartford defines increases or decreases greater than or equal to 200 , or changes from a net gain to a net loss position, or vice versa, as NM or not meaningful.

 Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A"), we use certain terms and abbreviations, the more commonly used are summarized in the Acronyms section. 
 
 KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND RATIOS 
 The Company considers the measures and ratios in the following discussion to be key performance indicators for its businesses. Management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the underlying trends in The Hartford s businesses. However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the results presented in the reportable segment and corporate operating summaries that follow in this MD A. These ratios and measures may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company s competitors. 
 Definitions of Non-GAAP and Other Measures and Ratios 
 Assets Under Management ("AUM")- Include mutual fund and exchange-traded fund ("ETF") assets. AUM is a measure used by the Company's Hartford Funds segment because a significant portion of the segment s revenues and expenses are based upon asset values. These revenues and expenses increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Book Value per Diluted Share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI")- This is a non-GAAP per share measure that i s calculated by dividing (a) common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes that excluding AOCI from the numerator is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. 
 Combined Ratio- The sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ("LAE") ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expenses for every 100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting losses. 
 Core Earnings- The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the Company s operating performance. The Hartford believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Company s ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain items. Therefore, the following items are excluded from core earnings: 
 Certain realized gains and losses - Generally realized gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income. 
 Restructuring and other costs - Costs incurred as part of a restructuring plan are not a recurring operating expense of the business. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt - Largely consisting of make-whole payments or tender premiums upon paying debt off before maturity, these losses are not a recurring operating expense of the business. 

Gains and losses on reinsurance transactions - Gains or losses on reinsurance, such as those entered into upon sale of a business or to reinsure loss reserves, are not a recurring operating expense of the business. 
 Integration and other non-recurring M A costs - These costs, including transaction costs incurred in connection with an acquired business, are incurred over a short period of time and do not represent an ongoing operating expense of the business. 
 Change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business - These changes in loss reserves are excluded from core earnings because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition. 
 Deferred gain resulting from retroactive reinsurance and subsequent changes in the deferred gain - Retroactive reinsurance agreements economically transfer risk to the reinsurers and excluding the deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance and related amortization of the deferred gain from core earnings provides greater insight into the economics of the business. 
 Change in valuation allowance on deferred taxes related to non-core components of before tax income - These changes in valuation allowances are excluded from core earnings because they relate to non-core components of before tax income, such as tax attributes like capital loss carryforwards. 
 Results of discontinued operations - These results are excluded from core earnings for businesses sold or held for sale because such results could obscure the ability to compare period over period results for our ongoing businesses. 
 In addition to the above components of net income available to common stockholders that are excluded from core earnings, preferred stock dividends declared, which are excluded from net income, are included in the determination of core earnings. Preferred stock dividends are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding. 
 Net income (loss) and net income (loss) available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to core earnings. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or net income (loss) available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company s business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, and core earnings when reviewing the Company s performance.

 [1] During 2024, the Company collected recoveries from National Indemnity Company ("NICO ), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. related to the Navigators adverse development cover ("Navigators ADC") and as a result amortized 26 and 87 of the deferred gain within benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the three and nine month periods, respectively. For additional information regarding the ADC reinsurance agreement, refer to Note 9 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 [2] Primarily represents the federal income tax expense (benefit) related to before tax items not included in core earnings. 
 Core Earnings Margin- The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it is an important measure of, the Group Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income margin, calculated by dividing net income by revenues, is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of Group Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses) as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. Core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Group Benefits. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD A - Group Benefits. 
 Current Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio- A component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current accident year ("CAY") (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums. For U.S. events, a catastrophe is an event that causes 25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers, as defined by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk. For international events, the Company's approach is similar, informed, in part, by how Lloyd's of London defines major losses. Lloyd's of London is an insurance market-place operating worldwide ("Lloyd's"). Lloyd's does not underwrite risks. The Company accepts risks as the sole member of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 ("Lloyd's Syndicate"). The current accident year catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums. 
 Expense Ratio- For Commercial Lines and Personal Lines is the ratio of underwriting expenses less fee income, to earned premiums. Underwriting expenses include the amortization of 

deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and insurance operating costs and other expenses, including certain centralized services costs and bad debt expense. DAC includes commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other incremental direct underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term. 
 The expense ratio for Group Benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses including amortization of intangibles and amortization of DAC, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. 
 The expense ratio for Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits does not include integration and other transaction costs associated with an acquired business. 
 Fee Income- Is largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of AUM in our Hartford Funds business. These fees are generally earned on a daily basis. Therefore, this fee income increases or decreases with the rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows. 
 Gross New Business Premium- Represents the amount of premiums charged, before ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Gross new business premium plus gross renewal written premium less ceded reinsurance equals total written premium. 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio- A measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the Company to achieve its targeted return on equity (" ROE ") fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company s practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the rate-making process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage. 
 Current Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio Before Catastrophes- A measure of the cost of non-catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. Management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development ("PYD"). 
 Loss Ratio, excluding Buyouts- Utilized for the Group Benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, excluding those related to buyout premiums, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. Since Group Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the profitability of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. Buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts. 
 Mutual Fund and Exchange-Traded Fund Assets- Are owned by the shareowners of those products and not by the Company and, therefore, are not reflected in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, except in instances where the Company seeds new investment products. 
 Mutual fund and ETF assets are a measure used by the Company primarily because a significant portion of the Company s Hartford Funds segment revenues and expenses are based upon asset values. These revenues and expenses increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows. 
 Net New Business Premium- Represents the amount of premiums charged, after ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Net new business premium plus renewal written premium equals total written premium. 
 Policy Count Retention- Represents the number of renewal policies issued during the current year period divided by the new and renewal policies issued in the prior period. Policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce 

premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by us and competitors. 
 Effective Policy Count Retention- Represents the number of policies expected to renew in the current year period, based on contract effective dates, divided by the new and renewal policies effective in the prior period. Effective policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Effective policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by us and competitors, as well as the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals by customers. Effective policy count retention statistics are subject to change from period to period based on the effect of differences between actual and expected policy cancellations throughout the policy period. 
 Policies in Force- Represents the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. The number of policies in force is a growth measure used for Personal Lines as well as small commercial within Commercial Lines and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention. 
 Policyholder Dividend Ratio- The ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium. 
 Premium Retention- For middle large commercial, represents the ratio of prior period premiums that were successfully renewed divided by premiums associated with policies available for renewal in the current period. Premium retention excludes premium amounts from annual audits, renewal written price increases and changes in exposure, including amount of insurance. Premium retention statistics are subject to change from period to period based on a number of factors, including the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals . 
 Prior Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio- Represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums. 
 Reinstatement Premiums- Represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of the Company ceding losses to reinsurers. 
 Renewal Earned Price Increase (Decrease)- Written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain Personal Lines automobile business and twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company s Property and Casualty ("P C") business. Since the Company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months. 

57

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Renewal Written Price Increase (Decrease)- For Commercial Lines, represents the combined effect of rate changes and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure on policies that renewed and includes amount of insurance. For Personal Lines, renewal written price increases represent the total change in premium per policy since the prior year on those policies that renewed and includes the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and other changes in exposure. For Personal Lines, other changes in exposure include, but are not limited to, the effect of changes in number of drivers, vehicles and incidents, as well as changes in customer policy elections, such as deductibles and limits. The rate component represents the change in rate impacting renewal policies as previously filed with and approved by state regulators during the period. Amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for automobiles, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers compensation. A number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the Company s pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company s underwriters and marketplace competition. Renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. Renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved. 
 Return on Assets ROA ), Core Earnings- The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the Hartford Funds segment s operating performance. ROA, core earnings is calculated by dividing annualized core earnings by a daily average AUM. ROA is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that ROA, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Hartford Funds segment because it reveals trends in our business that may be obscured by the effect of items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. ROA, core earnings, should 

not be considered as a substitute for ROA and does not reflect the overall profitability of our Hartford Funds business. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both ROA, and ROA, core earnings when reviewing the Hartford Funds segment performance. A reconciliation of ROA to ROA, core earnings is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD A - Hartford Funds. 
 Underlying Combined Ratio- This non-GAAP financial measure of underwriting results represents the combined ratio before catastrophes, prior accident year development and current accident year change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development. The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are excluded from underlying combined ratio because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our investors' ability to assess the Company's financial performance. 
 A reconciliation of combined ratio to underlying combined ratio is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD A - Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. 
 Underwriting Gain (Loss)- The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Commercial and Personal Lines segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax non-GAAP measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the Company's investing activities.

 Written and Earned Premiums- Written premium represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Management believes that written premium is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company s sale of property and casualty insurance products. Written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded reinsurance premium. 

Traditional life and disability insurance type products, such as those sold by Group Benefits, collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. These premiums together with net investment income earned are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts. Two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. Sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, customer demand for the Company s product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the Company s reputation and ratings. Persistency refers to the percentage of premium remaining in-force from year-to-year.

 THE HARTFORD S OPERATIONS 
 The Hartford conducts business principally in five reportable segments including Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Property Casualty Other Operations, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. The Company includes in the Corporate category reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, restructuring costs, capital raising activities (including equity financing, debt financing and related interest expense), transaction expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition, certain M A costs, purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and other expenses not allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate also includes investment management fees and expenses related to managing third-party assets. 
 The Company derives its revenues principally from: (a) premiums earned for insurance coverage provided to insureds; (b) management fees on mutual fund and ETF assets; (c) net investment income; (d) fees earned for services provided to third parties; and (e) net realized gains and losses. Premiums charged for insurance coverage are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in-force. 
 The profitability of the Company's property and casualty insurance businesses over time is greatly influenced by the Company s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance, the size of its in force block, making reliable estimates of actual mortality and morbidity, and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments and the Lloyd's Syndicate's ability to write business is subject to Lloyd's approval for its premium capacity each year. Most of Personal Lines written premium is associated with our exclusive licensing agreement with AARP, which is effective through December 31, 2032. This agreement provides an important competitive advantage given the size of the 50 plus population and the strength of the AARP brand. 
 Similar to property and casualty, profitability of the group benefits business depends, in large part, on the ability to evaluate and price risks appropriately and make reliable estimates of mortality, morbidity, disability and longevity. To manage the pricing risk, Group Benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy 

terms in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, loss costs, declining interest rates and other factors. However, as policies are typically sold with rate guarantees an average of three years, pricing for the Company s products could prove to be inadequate if loss and expense trends emerge adversely during the rate guarantee period or if investment returns are lower than expected at the time the products were sold. For some of its products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments. New and renewal business for group benefits business, particularly for long-term disability (" LTD") , are priced using an assumption about expected investment yields over time. While the Company employs asset-liability duration matching strategies to mitigate risk and may use interest-rate sensitive derivatives to hedge its exposure in the Group Benefits investment portfolio, cash flow patterns related to the payment of benefits and claims are uncertain and actual investment yields could differ significantly from expected investment yields, affecting profitability of the business. In addition to appropriately evaluating and pricing risks, the profitability of the Group Benefits business depends on other factors, including the Company s response to pricing decisions and other actions taken by competitors, its ability to offer voluntary products and self-service capabilities, the persistency of its sold business and its ability to manage its expenses which it seeks to achieve through economies of scale and operating efficiencies. 
 The financial results of the Company s mutual fund and ETF businesses depend largely on the amount of AUM and the level of fees charged based, in part, on asset share class and fund type. Changes in AUM are driven by the two main factors of net flows and the market return of the funds, which are heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity and bond markets. Net flows are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund and ETF shareowners. Financial results are highly correlated to the growth in AUM since these funds generally earn fee income on a daily basis. 
 The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses are paid. Due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations, the majority of the Company s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale ("AFS") securities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities ("ABS") and collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs"). The Company also invests in commercial mortgage loans as well as limited partnerships and alternative investments, which are private investments that are less liquid, but have the potential to generate higher returns. The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient net of tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Consolidated Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes as well as with the reportable segment and corporate operating summaries within the MD A. 

Consolidated Results of Operations

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income available to common stockholders increased by 116, primarily driven by: 
 Lower net realized losses of 77, before tax; 
 Higher net investment income of 62, before tax, primarily driven by a higher yield on fixed maturities and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by lower income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments and; 
 A slight increase in the P C underwriting gain of 5, before tax, driven by the effect of earned premium growth, a lower CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes in Personal Lines and a higher level of favorable prior accident year reserve development, partially offset by higher CAY catastrophe losses, a higher CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes in Commercial Lines, and a higher expense ratio. 

These increases were partially offset by: 
 In Group Benefits, a higher expense ratio, a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products, and a higher group disability loss ratio, partially offset by a lower group life loss ratio and the effect of higher fully insured ongoing premiums. 
 For a discussion of the Company's operating results by segment, see MD A - Reportable Segment and Corporate Operating Summaries.

 REVENUE 
 Earned Premiums 

Earned premiums increased by 424 primarily due to: 
 An increase in P C reflecting a 10 increase in Commercial Lines and a 13 increase in Personal Lines. 
 Contributing to the increase in Commercial Lines was the effect of an increase in new business across most lines of business, earned pricing increases, and higher insured exposures, principally in workers compensation and property lines. 
 For Personal Lines, earned premium increased primarily due to the effect of earned pricing increases, partially offset by non-renewals. 
 An increase in Group Benefits earned premium of 2 , including an increase in exposure on existing accounts, new business sales, and persistency in excess of 90 , though slightly below the prior year periods. 
 Fee income increased primarily driven by higher daily average assets within Hartford Funds resulting from an increase in equity market levels, partially offset by net outflows over the preceding twelve months. 

Net Investment Income 

Net investment income increased primarily due to the impact of reinvesting at higher interest rates and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by a lower level of income on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. 
 Net realized losses improved primarily due to: 
 Gains on interest rate derivatives in the 2024 period compared to losses in the 2023 period due to lower interest rates; and 
 Valuation improvements on equity securities in the 2024 period compared to declines in the 2023 period. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 Higher net losses on sales of fixed maturities; and 
 Losses on transactional foreign currency revaluation in the 2024 period compared to gains in the 2023 period. 
 For further discussion of investment results, see MD A - Investment Results, Net Realized Gains and MD A - Investment Results, Net Investment Income.

 Losses and LAE Incurred for P C 
 
 Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased due to: 
 An increase in Property Casualty of 265 which was attributable to: 
 An increase in P C CAY loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes of 209, before tax, primarily due to the effect of higher earned premiums and a slightly higher CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes in Commercial Lines, partially offset by a lower CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes in Personal Lines. 
 An increase in CAY catastrophe losses of 63, before tax. Catastrophe losses in the 2024 period included losses from hurricanes, including a loss of 104 from Hurricane Helene, and tropical storms primarily in the Southeast and South regions, and to a lesser extent, tornado, wind and hail events primarily in the Midwest, Northeast and Mountain West regions. Catastrophe losses in the 2023 period included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, losses from hurricanes and tropical storms in the Southeast and West Coast. 
 Partially offset by: 
 Net favorable prior accident year reserve development of 50, before tax, in P C compared to 43 in the prior year period. Favorable prior year reserve development in the 2024 period was primarily driven by decreases in reserves related to workers' compensation and Personal Lines automobile physical damage, partially offset by increases in reserves for general liability and Commercial Lines automobile liability. The 2024 period also included a benefit of 26 related to amortization of the Navigators ADC deferred gain. Prior accident year reserve development in the 2023 period was a net favorable 43, before tax, primarily driven by decreases in reserves related to workers

 compensation and package business, partly offset by an increase in reserves for general liability. 
 For further discussion, see Note 9 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 A slight increase in Group Benefits of 15, before tax, primarily driven by the effect of higher earned premiums, a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products, and a higher loss ratio on paid family and medical leave products, partially offset by lower group life mortality and a favorable change in the long-term disability recovery rate assumption. 
 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased from the prior year period driven by Commercial Lines, reflecting an increase in earned premiums across all commercial lines of business. 
 Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased due to: 
 Increased expense from higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, partly in response to increased business volume; and 
 Higher direct marketing costs in Personal Lines. 
 Income tax expense increased primarily due to an increase in income before tax. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 12 - Income Taxes of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income available to common stockholders increased by 525 primarily driven by: 
 An increase in P C underwriting gain of 250, before tax, driven by the effect of earned premium growth, a higher level of favorable prior accident year reserve development, and lower CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes in Personal Lines, partially offset by higher CAY catastrophe losses; 

Higher net investment income of 202, befo re tax, primarily driven by a higher yield on fixed maturities and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by lower income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments; 
 Lower net realized losses of 117, before tax; and 
 In Group Benefits, a lower group life loss ratio and the effect of higher fully insured ongoing premiums, partially offset by a higher expense ratio, a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products, and a higher group disability loss ratio. 
 For a discussion of the Company's operating results by segment, see MD A - Reportable Segment and Corporate Operating Summaries. 

REVENUE 
 Earned Premiums 

Earned premiums increased by 1,165, or 7 , primarily due to: 
 An increase in P C reflecting a 9 increase in Commercial Lines and a 12 increase in Personal Lines. 
 Contributing to the increase in Commercial Lines was the effect of an increase in new business across most lines of business, earned pricing increases, and higher insured exposures, principally in workers compensation and property lines. 
 For Personal Lines, earned premium increased primarily due to the effect of earned pricing increases, partially offset by non-renewals. 

Net Investment Income 
 
 An increase in Group Benefits earned premium of 2 , including an increase in exposure on existing accounts, new business sales, and persistency in excess of 90 , though slightly below the prior year periods. 
 Fee income increased, primarily due to a 33 increase in Hartford Funds driven by higher daily average assets resulting from an increase in equity market levels, partially offset by net outflows over the preceding twelve months. 
 Net investment income increased primarily due to the impact of reinvesting at higher interest rates, a higher level of invested asset s, and, to a lesser extent, a higher yield on variable-rate securities, partially offset by a lower level of income on limited partnerships and other alternative investments.

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Net realized losses improved primarily due to: 
 Gains on interest rate derivatives in the 2024 period compared to losses in the 2023 period due to lower interest rates; 
 No losses on credit derivatives in the 2024 period compared to losses in the 2023 period; and 
 Valuation improvements on equity securities in the 2024 period compared to valuation declines and sales in the 2023 period. 

These increases were partially offset by: 
 Higher net losses on sales of fixed maturities. 
 For further discussion of investment results, see MD A - Investment Results, Net Realized Gains and MD A - Investment Results, Net Investment Income. 

BENEFITS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES 
 Losses and LAE Incurred for P C 
 
 Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased 490, due to: 
 An increase in Property Casualty of 509, which was attributable to: 
 An increase in P C CAY loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes of 555, before tax, primarily due to the effect of higher earned premiums, partially offset by a lower CAY loss and LAE ratio in Personal Lines; and 
 An increase in CAY catastrophe losses of 93, before tax. Catastrophe losses in the 2024 period included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, as well as losses from hurricanes and tropical storms mainly in the Southeast and South regions, and, to a lesser extent, from winter storms, mainly in the Pacific, Northeast, and South regions. Catastrophe losses in the 2023 period included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, and losses from winter storms along the East and West Coasts. 

Losses and LAE Incurred for Group Benefits 
 
 Partially offset by: 
 Net favorable prior accident year reserve development of 221, before tax, in P C compared to net favorable prior accident year reserve development in the 2023 period of 82. Favorable prior year reserve development in the 2024 period was primarily driven by decreases in reserves related to workers' compensation, catastrophes, bond, Personal Lines automobile physical damage, homeowners, and Personal Lines automobile liability, partially offset by increases in reserves for general liability, Commercial Lines automobile liability, and assumed reinsurance. The 2024 period also included a benefit of 87 related to amortization of the Navigators ADC deferred gain. Prior accident year reserve development in the 2023 period was a net favorable 82, before tax, primarily driven by decreases in reserves related to workers' compensation and catastrophes, offset by increases in reserves for general liability, Personal Lines automobile physical damage, assumed reinsurance and bond.

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Partially offset by: 
 A decrease in Group Benefits of 19, before tax, primarily driven by lower group life mortality, favorable long-term disability claim recoveries and incidence, and a favorable change in the long-term disability recovery rate assumption, partially offset by the effect of higher earned premiums and a higher loss ratio on paid family and medical leave products. 
 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased from the prior year period driven by Commercial Lines, reflecting an increase in earned premiums across all commercial lines of business. 

Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased due to: 
 Increased expense from higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, and commissions in Group Benefits, partly in response to increased business volume; and 
 Higher direct marketing costs in Personal Lines. 
 Income tax expense increased primarily due to an increase in income before tax. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 12 - Income Taxes of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 
 Total investments increased primarily due to an increase in fixed maturities, AFS, at fair value. 

Fixed maturities, AFS, at fair value increased primarily due to net additions of corporate bonds, high-quality residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") and CLOs, partially offset by net reductions to U.S. treasuries, tax-exempt municipal bonds, and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"). The increase was also due to higher valuations as a result of lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads.

 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Total net investment income increased primarily due to the impact of reinvesting at higher interest rates and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by a lower level of income on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. 
 Annualized net investment income yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, was up primarily due to the impact of reinvesting at higher rates. 
 Average reinvestment rates, on fixed maturities and mortgage loans, excluding certain U.S. Treasury securities, for 

the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 5.5 and 6.0 , respectively, which were above the average yield of sales and maturities of 4.4 and 4.7 , respectively. Average reinvestment rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were 6.0 and 5.7 , respectively, which were above the average yield of sales and maturities of 4.5 and 4.2 , respectively. 
 For the 2024 calendar year, we expect the annualized net investment income yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, to be above the portfolio yield earned in 2023 due to the higher rate environment. The estimated impact on annualized net investment income yield is subject to variability including the impact of evolving market conditions.

 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Gross gains and losses on sales were primarily due to sales of U.S. treasuries, corporate securities, and tax-exempt municipals to fund purchases of higher-yielding investments. 
 Equity securities net gains were primarily driven by an increase in value due to higher equity market levels. 
 Other, net gains for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 primarily included gains of 12 and 9, respectively, on interest rate derivatives driven by changes in interest rates, gains of 11 and 6 on equity derivatives driven by changes in equity market levels, and losses of 11 and 5, respectively, on transactional foreign currency revaluation. 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Gross gains and losses on sales were primarily due to sales of corporate securities and tax-exempt municipals, in addition to sales of U.S. treasuries for duration and/or liquidity management. 
 Equity securities net losses for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by a decline in value due to lower equity market levels. Equity securities net gains for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by an increase in value due to higher equity market levels. 
 Other, net losses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 primarily included losses of 71 and 53, respectively, on interest rate derivatives driven by an increase in interest rates and losses of 3 and 55, on credit derivatives primarily due to changes in valuations. Also included for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 were gains of 16 on FVO securities due to changes in credit spreads and gains of 13 on transactional foreign currency revaluation.

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates. 
 The Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: 
 property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; 
 group benefit LTD reserves, net of reinsurance; 
 evaluation of goodwill for impairment; 
 valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and ACL on mortgage loans; and 
 contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters. 
 In developing these estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements. Certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Company s critical accounting estimates are discussed in Part II, Item 7 MD A in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. In addition, - Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report should be read in conjunction with this section to assist with obtaining an understanding of the underlying accounting policies related to these estimates. The following discussion updates certain of the Company s critical accounting estimates as of September 30, 2024. 

| PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCT RESERVES, NET OF REINSURANCE 
 P C Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves, Net of Reinsurance, by Segment as of September 30, 2024 
 
 Based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the Company determines the appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. Recorded reserve estimates represent the Company's best estimate of the ultimate settlement amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Company does not use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels in the process of determining its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges. Assumptions used in arriving at the selected actuarial indications consider a number of factors, including the immaturity of emerged claims in recent accident years, emerging trends in the recent past, and the level of volatility within each line of business. In general, adjustments are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Such adjustments of reserves are referred to as prior accident year development . Increases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either an increase in prior accident year reserves or as unfavorable reserve development. Decreases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either a decrease in prior accident year reserves or as favorable reserve development. Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and is set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow.

 Net Income 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to higher net investment income and lower net realized losses, partially offset by a lower underwriting gain. Net income for the nine month period increased primarily due to a higher underwriting gain, higher net investment income and lower net realized losses. For further discussion of investment results, see MD A - Investment Results. 

Underwriting Gain 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Underwriting gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased due to higher CAY catastrophe losses, a higher CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes and less favorable prior accident year development, including 26 of a benefit for amortization of a deferred gain on the Navigators ADC in the current year period, partially offset by the effect of earned premium growth. Underwriting gain for the nine month period increased due to the effect of earned premium growth and higher favorable prior accident year development, including 87 of a benefit for amortization of a deferred gain on the Navigators ADC in the current year period, partially offset by higher CAY catastrophe losses. 
 Expense ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased driven by higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premium. Expense ratio for the nine month period was flat as the impact of higher earned premium was offset by higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefits costs.

 Earned Premiums 
 
 [1] Other earned premiums of 14 and 14, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively and 40 and 43 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively. 
 
 Written Premiums 
 
 [1] Other written premiums of 14 and 14 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively and 40 and 42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Earned premiums for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to written premium increases over the prior twelve months, including the effect of higher insured exposures, principally in workers compensation and property lines. 
 Written premiums for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased driven by growth across small commercial, middle large commercial and global specialty. 
 Small commercial written premium increased driven by double-digit new business growth, renewal written price increases in all lines and higher insured exposures. Written premium grew in nearly all lines of business, including package business, excess and surplus and automobile. 
 Middle large commercial written premium increased driven by double-digit new business growth, renewal written price increases in all lines and higher insured exposures. Written premium grew in nearly all lines across industry verticals, specialty markets, general industries and large property. 
 Global specialty written premium increased driven by written price increases across almost all lines as well as an increase in gross new business, primarily in casualty lines. Written premiums grew across most U.S. lines, global reinsurance and international lines. 
 Renewal written price increases were recognized in nearly all lines in both the three and nine month periods, with price increases across most lines other than directors and officers ("D O"). 
 In small commercial, renewal written price increases were higher in 2024, with accelerating year to date double-digit price increases in package business and automobile and moderating double-digit price increases in excess and surplus lines. Workers' compensation pricing year to date was slightly positive and consistent with 2023. 
 In middle market, renewal written price increases were generally flat to 2023, with year to date high single-digit to low double-digit price increases in most lines other than workers compensation, which was slightly positive. Property pricing has moderated from elevated levels in 2023 while automobile pricing has accelerated. 
 In global specialty, U.S. price increases were higher than prior year levels and we achieved mid single-digit renewal written price increases overall, with high single to low double-digit increases in marine, casualty and auto lines. D O pricing continues to be negative, but to a lesser extent than the prior year.

 Current Accident Year Loss and LAE Ratio before Catastrophes 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Current accident year loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 deteriorated primarily due to a higher general liability loss ratio, partially offset by lower net non-catastrophe property losses. 
 Catastrophes and Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Accident Year Development 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Current accident year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included losses from hurricanes, including a loss of 55 from Hurricane Helene, and tropical storms primarily in the Southeast and South regions and, to a lesser extent, tornado, wind and hail events primarily in the Midwest and Northeast regions. 
 Current accident year catastrophe losses for the nine month period included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, hurricanes and tropical storms primarily in the Southeast and South regions and, to a lesser extent, winter storms mainly in the Pacific, Northeast and South regions. 
 Current accident year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, and to a lesser extent, losses from hurricanes and tropical storms. Current accident year catastrophe losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, and losses from winter storms along the East and West coasts. 
 Prior accident year development was net favorable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and included reserve decreases for workers' compensation and, for the nine month period, catastrophes and bond, partially offset by reserve increases for general liability, automobile liability and, for the nine month period, assumed reinsurance. Also included are benefits of 26 and 87 related to amortization of the Navigators ADC deferred gain for the three and nine month periods, respectively. For additional information regarding the ADC reinsurance agreement, refer to Note 9 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Prior accident year development was net favorable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and included reserve decreases for workers' compensation and package business, partially offset by reserve increases for general liability and assumed reinsurance. In addition, the nine month period included a reserve decrease for catastrophes.

 Net Income (Loss) 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Income changed to a net gain for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss for the prior year periods, largely driven by improved underwriting results and an increase in net investment income. 

Underwriting Loss 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Underwriting loss decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by a decrease in the CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes, the effect of an increase in earned premium due to renewal written price increases, and a change from unfavorable to favorable prior accident year development, partially offset by an increase in current accident year catastrophe losses, and an increase in underwriting expenses. 
 Expense ratio increased in the three month period primarily due to an increase in direct marketing costs, higher commissions, and higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premium driven by earned pricing increases. For the nine month period, the increase was primarily due to higher commissions, higher direct marketing costs, and higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premium.

 Earned Premiums 
 
 Written Premiums 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Earned premiums increased in both the three and nine month periods due to higher written premium over the prior twelve months in both automobile and homeowners. 
 Written premiums increased in both the three and nine month periods driven by the effect of written pricing increases and by an increase in new premium in both automobile and homeowners. 
 Renewal written pricing increases were higher for both automobile and homeowners in the three and nine month periods, primarily in response to recent elevated loss cost trends as well as higher insured values in homeowners. 
 Policy count retention decreased both for automobile and for homeowners in the three month period, and decreased for automobile and was stable for homeowners in the nine month period, in response to renewal written pricing increases. 
 Effective Policy count retention decreased for automobile and was stable for homeowners in the three month period, and decreased both for automobile and homeowners in the nine month period, in response to renewal written pricing increases. 
 Policies in-force as of September 30, 2024 declined since September 30, 2023 for both automobile and homeowners, reflecting the level of new business in relation to non-renewed policies.

 Current Accident Year Loss and LAE Ratio before Catastrophes 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Current accident year Loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes decreased in automobile and homeowners for both the three and nine month periods. The decrease in automobile was primarily due to the impact of earned pricing increases as well as lower physical damage claim frequency, partially offset by higher automobile claim severities. The automobile physical damage claim severity trend has moderated from the prior year. The automobile liability severity increases continue to recognize the inflationary effects and higher attorney representation rates on bodily injury claims. For homeowners, the decrease in the CAY loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes was primarily due to the impact of earned pricing increases and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher claim severities. Contributing to the higher homeowners severity was the effect of higher rebuilding costs. 

Current Accident Year Catastrophes and Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Accident Year Development 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Current accident year catastrophe losses increased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year. CAY catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included losses from hurricanes and tropical storms, primarily in the Southeast region, including a loss of 49 for Hurricane Helene, and to a lesser extent, tornado, wind and hail events, mainly in the Midwest, Mountain West and Northeast regions. CAY catastrophe losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included losses from tornado, wind and hail events in several regions of the United States, and to a lesser extent, from hurricanes and tropical storms primarily in the Southeast region. CAY catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, and to a lesser extent, wildfire events and hurricanes and tropical storms. The nine month period also included losses from winter storms primarily on the East and West coasts. 
 Prior accident year development was favorable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower estimated severity on automobile physical damage and homeowners, and for the nine month period, automobile liability. Prior accident year development was an unfavorable 1 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net unfavorable prior accident year development in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by automobile physical damage.

 Net income 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to a lower underwriting loss and no net realized gains or losses in the 2024 period compared to net realized losses in the 2023 period. Net income increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to higher net investment income and lower net realized losses. The increases to net income in both periods were partially offset by an increase in other expense relating to a one-time contract settlement charge on a claims servicing arrangement. 
 Underwriting loss decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to unfavorable prior accident year reserve development in the 2023 period. Underwriting loss decreased slightly in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in underwriting expenses.

 Net Income 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to a lower group life loss ratio and higher fully insured ongoing premiums, partially offset by a higher expense ratio , a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products, and a higher group disability loss ratio. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2024, benefitted from no net realized gain or loss in the 2024 period compared to net realized losses in the 2023 period, while the nine month period benefitted from lower net realized losses in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. 
 Insurance operating costs and other expenses were higher for both the three and nine month periods, prim arily due to the effect of higher fully insured ongoing premium, including higher staffing costs and commissions, as well as higher incentive compensation and benefits costs. 

Fully Insured Ongoing Premiums 
 
 [1] Other of 102 and 107 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 respectively, and 304 and 318 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively which includes other group coverages such as retiree health insurance, critical illness, accident and hospital indemnity coverages. 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Fully insured ongoing premiums increased in both the three and nine month periods over prior year and included an increase in exposure on existing accounts, new business sales, and persistency in excess of 90 , though slightly below the prior year periods. 
 Fully insured ongoing sales decreased in both the three and nine months periods compared to prior year driven by lower group life and group disability sales.

 Ratios 
 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Loss ratio was flat in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compa red to the prior year period driven by a lower group life loss ratio offset by a higher disability loss ratio, as well as a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products. The group life loss ratio decreased 2.7 points driven by lower mortality. The group disability loss ratio increased 0.6 points driven by a higher loss ratio on paid family and medical leave products, partially offset by a favorable change in the long-term disability recovery rate assumption of 2.2 points. 

Total loss ratio improved 1.7 points in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting a lower group life loss ratio. The group life loss ratio decreased 5.4 points driven by a lower level of mortality. The group disability loss ratio was essentially flat driven by favorable long-term disability claim recoveries, incidence, and changes in the long-term disability recovery rate assumption of 0.7 points, offset by higher loss ratio on paid family and medical leave products. 
 Expense ratio increased for the three and nine month periods primarily due to the impact of higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, and increased investments in technology.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT 
 The Company s Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in our Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of the Company s risks. 
 The Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee ERCC oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. 
 The Company's enterprise risk management ("ERM") function supports the ERCC and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things: 
 risk identification and assessment; 
 the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits; 
 risk monitoring; and 
 internal and external risk reporting. 
 The Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk. Insurance risk and financial risk are described in more detail below. Operational risk, including cybersecurity, and specific risk tolerances for natural catastrophes, terrorism and pandemic risk are described in the ERM section of the MD A in The Hartford s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 
 | INSURANCE RISK 
 Insurance risk is the risk of losses of both a catastrophic and non-catastrophic nature on the P C and Group Benefits products the Company has sold. Catastrophe insurance risk is the exposure arising from both natural catastrophes (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, pandemics) and man-made catastrophes (e.g., terrorism, cyber-attacks) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios. 
 Sources of Insurance Risk Non-catastrophe insurance risks exist within each of the Company's segments except Hartford Funds and include: 
 Property- Risk of loss to personal or commercial property from automobile related accidents, weather, explosions, smoke, shaking, fire, theft, vandalism, inadequate installation, faulty equipment, collisions and falling objects, and/or machinery mechanical breakdown resulting in physical damage, losses from PV T and other covered perils. 
 Liability- Risk of loss from automobile related accidents, uninsured and underinsured drivers, lawsuits from accidents, defective products, breach of warranty, negligent acts by professional practitioners, environmental claims, latent exposures, fraud, coercion, forgery, failure to fulfill obligations per contract surety, liability from errors and omissions, losses from CPRI coverages, losses from 

derivative lawsuits, and other securities actions and covered perils. 
 Mortality- Risk of loss from unexpected trends in insured deaths impacting timing of payouts from group life insurance, personal or commercial automobile related accidents, and death of employees or executives during the course of employment, while on disability, or while collecting workers compensation benefits. 
 Morbidity- Risk of loss to an insured from illness incurred during the course of employment or illness from other covered perils. 
 Disability- Risk of loss incurred from personal or commercial automobile related losses, accidents arising outside of the workplace, injuries or accidents incurred during the course of employment, or from equipment, with each loss resulting in short-term or long-term disability payments. 
 Longevity- Risk of loss from increased life expectancy trends among policyholders receiving long-term benefit payments. 
 Cyber Insurance - Risk of loss to property, breach of data and business interruption from various types of cyber-attacks. 
 Catastrophe risk primarily arises in the property, automobile, workers' compensation, casualty, group life, and group disability lines of business but could also arise from other coverages such as losses under PV T and CPRI policies. Not all insurance losses arising from catastrophe risk are categorized as catastrophe losses within the segment operating results. For example, losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic were not categorized as catastrophe losses within either the P C or Group Benefits segments as the pandemic was not identified as a catastrophe event by the Property Claim Service in the U.S. See the term Current Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio within the Key Performance Measures section of MD A for an explanation of how the Company defines catastrophe losses in its financial reporting. 
 Impact Non-catastrophe insurance risk can arise from unexpected loss experience, underpriced business and/or underestimation of loss reserves and can have significant effects on the Company s earnings. Catastrophe insurance risk can arise from various unpredictable events and can have significant effects on the Company's earnings and may result in losses that could constrain its liquidity. 
 Management The Company's policies and procedures for managing these risks include disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk-based pricing, risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. The Company has established underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and risks in the aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. The Company uses both internal and third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the Company's financial position and results of operations across its businesses.

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 The Hartford closely monitors scientific literature on climate change to help identify climate change risks impacting our business. We use data from the scientific community and other outside experts including partnerships with third-party catastrophe modeling firms to inform our risk management activities and stay abreast of potential implications of climate-related impacts that we incorporate into our risk assessment. We regularly study these climate change implications and incorporate these risks into our catastrophe risk assessment and management strategy through product pricing, underwriting and management of aggregate risk to manage implications of severe weather and climate change in our insurance portfolio. 
 In addition, certain insurance products offered by The Hartford provide coverage for losses incurred due to cyber events and the Company has assessed and modeled how those products would respond to different events in order to manage its aggregate exposure to losses incurred under the insurance policies we sell. The Company models numerous deterministic scenarios including losses caused by malware, data breach, distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of cloud environments and attacks of power grids. 
 Among specific risk tolerances set by the Company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk. 
 
 Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy 
 The Company uses reinsurance to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company's risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that reinsure property and workers' compensation exposures, and individual risk (including facultative reinsurance) or quota share arrangements that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The Company has no significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund FHCF ), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act TRIPRA") and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business. 

Reinsurance for Catastrophes - The Company utilizes various reinsurance programs to mitigate catastrophe losses including excess of loss occurrence-based treaties covering property and workers compensation, a catastrophe bond, an aggregate property catastrophe treaty, and individual risk agreements (including facultative reinsurance) that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The occurrence property catastrophe treaty and workers compensation catastrophe treaties beginning with the January 1, 2021 renewal do not cover pandemic losses, as most industry reinsurance programs exclude communicable disease. The Company has reinsurance in place to cover individual group life losses in excess of 1 per person.

 [1] These agreements do not cover the assumed reinsurance business which purchases its own retrocessional coverage. 
 [2] In addition to the Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty, for Florida homeowners wind events, The Hartford has purchased the mandatory FHCF reinsurance for the annual period starting June 1, 2024. Retention and coverage varies by writing company. For the 2024 - 2025 period, the writing company with the largest coverage under FHCF is Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest, with coverage of 35 in per event losses in excess of a 19 retention (estimates are based on best available information at this time and are periodically updated as information is made available by Florida). 
 [3] Named hurricanes and tropical storms are defined as any storm or storm system declared to be a hurricane or tropical storm by the US National Hurricane Center, US Weather Prediction Center, or their successor organizations (being divisions of the US National Weather Service). 
 [4] Portions of this layer of coverage extend beyond a traditional one year term. 
 [5] For further information on the Company's catastrophe bond, see MD A - Enterprise Risk Management, Insurance Risk included in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K Annual report. 
 [6] Tropical cyclones are defined as a storm or storm system that has been declared by National Weather Service or any division or agency thereof (including the National Hurricane Center or the Weather Prediction Center) or any of their successors to be a hurricane, tropical storm, or tropical depression. 
 [7] The aggregate treaty is not limited to a single event; rather, it is designed to provide reinsurance protection for the aggregate of all catastrophe events (up to 350 per event), either designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk or, for international business, net losses arising from two or more risks involved in the same loss occurrence totaling at least 500 thousand. All catastrophe losses, except assumed reinsurance business losses, apply toward satisfying the 750 attachment point under the aggregate treaty. 
 [8] In addition to the limits shown, the workers' compensation reinsurance includes a non-catastrophe, industrial accident layer, providing coverage for 80 of 25 in per event losses in excess of a 25 retention. 
 In addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the Company has other reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses, some of which provide for reinstatement of limits in the event of a loss with reinstatement provisions varying depending on the layer of coverage. The Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty, and Workers' Compensation Catastrophe Treaty include a provision to reinstate one limit in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties. 
 Reinsurance for Terrorism- For the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As such, the Company's principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA to the end of 2027. 
 TRIPRA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any act of terrorism , which is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, for losses that exceed a threshold of industry losses of 200. Under the 

program, in any one calendar year, the federal government will pay a percentage of losses incurred from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer's losses exceed 20 of the Company's eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of 100 billion. The percentage of losses paid by the federal government is 80 . The Company's estimated deductible under the program is 2.0 billion for 2024. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the 100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of 100 billion will be paid. 
 Reinsurance for A E and Navigators Group Reserve Development - The Company has two adverse development covers ("ADC") reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. One agreement covers substantially all A E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years (the A E ADC up to an aggregate limit of 1.5 billion and the other covered substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (the Navigators ADC up to an aggregate limit of 300, for which the Company

 had previously ceded the available limit. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had paid claims related to the Navigators ADC in excess of the 1.816 billion acquisition date reserves plus the 100 retention. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company collected recoveries from NICO and as a result amortized 87 of the 209 deferred gain within benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deferred gain on the Navigators ADC was 122 and 209, respectively, and is included in other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 For more information on the A E ADC and the Navigators ADC, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in The Hartford's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 
 | FINANCIAL RISK 
 Financial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives from events that impact financial market conditions and the value of financial assets. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's invested assets. 
 Consistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored and managed, with risks mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including limiting aggregation of risk, portfolio re-balancing and hedging with over-the-counter ("OTC") and exchange-traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives may be used to achieve the following Company-approved objectives: (1) hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; (2) managing liquidity; (3) controlling transaction costs; and (4) engaging in income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company s compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management. The Company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity, and foreign currency exchange. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due. 
 Sources of Liquidity Risk Sources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value of the investment portfolio. 

Impact Inadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. 
 Management The Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquid assets among legal entities. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact operating cash flows or liquid assets. The liquidity requirements of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("HFSG Holding Company") have been and will continue to be met by the HFSG Holding Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from its subsidiaries, principally from its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities, as needed. The Company maintains multiple sources of contingent liquidity including a revolving credit facility, an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates, and access to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (" FHLBB ") for certain affiliates. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk. 
 
 Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor s or counterparty s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spreads. 
 Sources of Credit Risk The majority of the Company s credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings and use of derivatives, but it is also present in the Company s ceded reinsurance activities and various insurance products. 
 Impact A decline in creditworthiness is typically reflected as an increase in an investment s credit spread and an associated decline in the investment's fair value, potentially resulting in recording an ACL and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. In certain instances, counterparties may default on their obligations and the Company may realize a loss on default. Premiums receivable, including premiums for retrospectively rated plans, reinsurance recoverable and deductible losses recoverable are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty s inability to pay. 
 Management The objective of the Company s enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify and manage credit risk in aggregate and to limit potential losses in accordance with the Company's credit risk management policy. The Company manages its credit risk by managing aggregations of risk, holding a diversified mix of issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance and insurance

 portfolios and limiting exposure to any specific reinsurer or counterparty. Potential credit losses can be mitigated through diversification (e.g., geographic regions, asset types, industry sectors), hedging and the use of collateral to reduce net credit exposure. 
 The Company manages credit risk through the use of various surveillance, analyses and governance processes. The investment and reinsurance areas have formal policies and procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish criteria defining minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability for eligible counterparties. Potential investments are subject to underwriting reviews and management approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include: 
 Investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities; 
 Selling investments subject to heightened credit risk; 
 Hedging through use of credit default swaps; 
 Clearing derivative transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin; 
 Entering into derivative and reinsurance contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions; 
 Requiring collateral; and 
 Non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties. 
 The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10 of the Company s stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Credit Risk of Derivatives 
 The Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction. 
 Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require additional collateralization before entering into any new trades. 

The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company s exposure to credit risk. Credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day s net fair value, including income accruals, of all derivative positions transacted with a single counterparty for each separate legal entity. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not necessarily reflective of credit risk. The Company enters into collateral arrangements in connection with its derivatives positions and collateral is pledged to or held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the exposure is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual requirements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Use of Credit Derivatives 
 The Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield. 
 Credit Risk Reduced Through Credit Derivatives 
 The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. 
 Credit Risk Assumed Through Credit Derivatives 
 The Company may also enter into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company s investment policies. These swaps primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers and indexes. 
 For further information on credit derivatives, see Note 6 - Derivatives of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Credit Risk of Business Operations 
 The Company is subject to credit risk related to the Company's Commercial Lines business that is written with large deductible policies or retrospectively-rated plans (referred to as "loss sensitive business"). The Company s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such contract holders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the retrospectively rated policyholders failed to pay additional premiums owed. While the Company attempts to manage the risks discussed above through underwriting, credit analysis, collateral requirements, provision for bad debt, and other oversight mechanisms, the Company s efforts may not be successful. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses 

95 

| Table of Contents 
 Index to MD A 
 
 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads. 
 Sources of Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from investments in fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, issuances by the Company of debt securities, preferred stock and similar securities, discount rate assumptions associated with the Company s claim reserves and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and assets that support the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
 Impact Changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the Company. 
 Management The Company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that seek to protect the Company from the economic impact associated with changes in interest rates by setting portfolio duration targets that are aligned with the duration of the liabilities that they support. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flow simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and the associated liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration. 
 The Company may also use interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, futures to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or liabilities and to manage portfolio duration. 
 
 Equity Risk 
 Equity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices. 
 Sources of Equity Risk The Company has exposure to equity risk from invested assets, assets that support the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and fee income derived from Hartford Funds AUM. 
 Impact The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, which could negatively impact the Company's reported earnings. In addition, investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments generally have a level of correlation to domestic equity market levels and can expose the Company to losses in earnings if valuations decline; however, earnings impacts are recognized on a lag as results from private equity investments and other funds are generally reported on a three-month delay. For assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. Hartford Funds earnings are 

also significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of average daily AUM and the amount of fee income generated from those assets. Increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact. 
 Management The Company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, and, at times, hedging of changes in equity indices. For assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies. 
 Sources of Currency Risk The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities, and derivative instruments. In addition, the Company has non-U.S. subsidiaries, some with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar, and which transact business in multiple currencies resulting in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. 
 Impact Changes in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities. 
 Management The Company manages its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through asset-liability matching and through the use of derivative instruments. However, legal entity capital is invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations. The foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using foreign currency swaps and forwards. 
 
 Investment Portfolio Risk 
 The following table presents the Company s fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality. The credit ratings referenced throughout this section are based on availability and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody s, S P, and Fitch. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used. Accrued investment income related to fixed maturities is not included in the amortized cost or fair value of the fixed maturities. For further information refer to Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The fair value of fixed maturities, AFS increased as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to net additions of corporate bonds, high-quality RMBS and CLOs, partially offset by net reductions to U.S. treasuries, tax-exempt municipal bonds, and CMBS. The increase was also due to higher valuations as a result of lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads.

 [1] Includes securities with pools of loans issued by the Small Business Administration which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. 
 The Company also has exposure to commercial mortgage loans. These loans are collateralized by real estate properties that are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These commercial loans are originated by the Company as high quality whole loans, and the Company may sell participation interests in one or more loans to third parties. A loan participation interest represents a pro-rata share in interest and principal payments generated by the participated loan, and the relationship between the Company as loan originator, lead participant and servicer and the third party as a participant are governed by a participation agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of 6.5 billion and carrying value of 6.4 billion, with an ACL of 44. As of December 31, 2023, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of 6.1 billion and carrying value of 6.1 billion, with an ACL of 51. The release in the allowance reflects write- 

offs, improved economic scenario forecasts and property specific reductions, partially offset by net additions of new loans. 
 The Company funded 462 of commercial mortgage loans, primarily industrial properties, with a weighted average loan-to-value LTV ratio of 58 and a weighted average yield of 7.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company continues to originate commercial mortgage loans on institutional-quality properties with strong LTV ratios. There were no mortgage loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.

 [2] Leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality, or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the largest issuer concentrations were the State of Illinois, the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, and CommonSpirit Health, which each comprised less than 3 of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. As of December 31, 2023, the largest issuer concentrations were the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, the State of Illinois, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which each comprised less than 3 of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds.

 Fixed Maturities, AFS Unrealized Loss Aging 
 The total gross unrealized losses were 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, and have decreased 0.8 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. As of September 30, 2024, 1.3 billion of the gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed less than 20 of amortized cost. The remaining 0.2 billion of gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed greater than 20 . The fixed maturities, AFS depressed more than 20 primarily related to corporate fixed maturities, municipal bonds, and U.S. treasuries, that are mainly depressed because current interest rates are higher and/or market spreads are wider than at the respective purchase dates. 

As part of the Company s ongoing investment monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these fixed maturities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the investments approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position where an ACL has not been recorded, the Company s best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the investment. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these investments. For further information regarding the Company s ACL analysis, see the Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments section below.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, unrealized losses on securities with an ACL recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI") were 0 and less than 1, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 There were no intent-to-sell impairments. 
 The Company incorporates its best estimate of future performance using internal assumptions and judgments that are informed by economic and industry specific trends, as well as our expectations with respect to security specific developments. 
 Future intent-to-sell impairments or credit losses may develop as the result of changes in our intent to sell specific securities that are in an unrealized loss position or if modeling assumptions, such as macroeconomic factors or security specific developments, change unfavorably from our current modeling assumptions, resulting in lower cash flow expectations. 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded net credit losses of 5 and 13, respectively. The net credit losses were primarily attributable to increases in the ACL of 5 and 11, respectively, related to three below investment grade corporate issuers. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, unrealized losses on securities with an ACL recognized in OCI were 0 and 4, respectively. 
 There were no intent-to-sell impairments. 

ACL on Mortgage Loans 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 The Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to estimate the ACL with changes in the ACL recorded in net realized gains and losses. Apart from an ACL recorded on individual mortgage loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company records an ACL on the pool of mortgage loans based on lifetime expected credit losses. For further information, refer to Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no credit loss adjustments on mortgage loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a credit loss reversal of 3 primarily attributable to improved economic scenario forecasts and property specific improvements, partially offset by net additions of new loans. 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an increase in the ACL on mortgage loans of 5 and 10, respectively. The increase in the allowance is primarily attributable to lower property valuations and overall weaker real estate fundamentals.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 The following section discusses the overall financial strength of The Hartford and its insurance operations including their ability to generate cash flows from each of their business segments, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. 
 
 | SUMMARY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 Capital available to the holding company as of September 30, 2024: 
 Approximately 1.2 billion in fixed maturities, short-term investments, investment sales receivable and cash at the HFSG Holding Company; 
 A senior unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for borrowing capacity up to 750 of unsecured credit through October 27, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding; and 
 An intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to 2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, 1.9 billion was available, 105 was outstanding between certain affiliates and there were no amounts outstanding at the HFSG holding company. 
 
 Dividends and other sources of capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 The future payment of dividends from our subsidiaries is dependent on several factors including the business results, capital position and liquidity of our subsidiaries. 
 P C - HFSG Holding Company received 967 of net dividends from the Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries through September 30, 2024; 
 Group Benefits - HFSG Holding Company received 533 in dividends from Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (" HLA ") through September 30, 2024; 
 Hartford Funds - HFSG Holding Company received 98 in dividends from Hartford Funds through September 30, 2024; and 
 Other - HFSG Holding Company received 28 in dividends from other non-insurance subsidiaries through September 30, 2024. 
 
 Expected liquidity requirements for the next twelve months as of September 30, 2024: 
 194 of interest on debt. See Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in The Hartford's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 

21 dividends on preferred stock, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors; and 
 595 of common stockholders' dividends, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and before share repurchases. 
 
 Expected liquidity requirements for beyond the next twelve months as of September 30, 2024: 
 Interest on and repayments of debt. See Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in The Hartford's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report; and 
 Preferred stock and common stock dividends, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Equity repurchase program: 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 11.0 million common shares for 1.1 billion under the 3.0 billion share repurchase authorization that is effective until December 31, 2024 as authorized by the Board of Directors. In addition to this authorization, in July 2024, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization for up to 3.3 billion effective from August 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026. While the Company anticipates using a portion of the new authorization over the remainder of 2024, it expects to use the vast majority of the new authorization in 2025 and 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 3.5 billion remaining for equity repurchases under both these share repurchase programs. During the period October 1, 2024 through October 23, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.0 million common shares for 115. 
 The timing of any repurchases is dependent on several factors, including the market price of the Company's securities, the Company's capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company's financial strength or credit ratings, the Company's blackout periods, and other considerations. 
 
 | LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL 
 The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (" HFSG Holding Company") 
 The liquidity requirements of HFSG Holding Company will primarily be met by HFSG Holding Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from its subsidiaries, principally its insurance operations . The Company maintains sufficient liquidity and has a variety of contingent 

103 

| Table of Contents 
 Index to MD A 
 
 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 liquidity resources to manage liquidity across a range of economic scenarios. 
 The HFSG Holding Company expects to continue to receive dividends from its operating subsidiaries in the future and manages capital in its operating subsidiaries to be sufficient under significant economic stress scenarios. Dividends from subsidiaries and other sources of funds at the holding company may be used to repurchase shares under the authorized share repurchase program at the discretion of management. 
 Under significant economic stress scenarios, the Company has the ability to meet short-term cash requirements, if needed, by borrowing under its revolving credit facility or by having its insurance subsidiaries take collateralized advances under a facility with the FHLBB. The Company could also choose to have its insurance subsidiaries sell certain highly liquid, high quality fixed maturities or the Company could issue debt in the public markets under its shelf registration. 
 
 | DIVIDENDS 
 The Hartford's Board of Directors declared the following quarterly dividends since July 1, 2024: 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 Declared Record Payable Amount per share July 17, 2024 September 3, 2024 October 2, 2024 0.470 October 24, 2024 December 2, 2024 January 3, 2025 0.520 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 Declared Record Payable Amount per share July 17, 2024 November 1, 2024 November 15, 2024 375.00 
 There are no current restrictions on the HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. 
 For a discussion of restrictions on dividends to the HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries, see the following "Dividends from Subsidiaries" discussion. For a discussion of potential restrictions on the HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends, see the risk factor "Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations" in Item 1A of Part I of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 | DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES 
 Dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. For a discussion of restrictions on dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries see Part II, Item 7, MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity - Dividends from Subsidiaries in The Hartford s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 Through the first nine months of 2024, HFSG Holding Company received 1.6 billion of net dividends from its subsidiaries, including 533 from HLA, 98 from Hartford Funds, 28 from other non-insurance subsidiaries and 967 from its P C 

subsidiaries, excluding 50 of P C dividends that were subsequently contributed to P C subsidiaries and 37 of P C dividends related to interest payments on an intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. ("HHI") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company. 
 
 | OTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL FOR THE HFSG HOLDING COMPANY 
 The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the "Ratings" section below for further discussion), and stockholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of debt, common equity, preferred stock, equity-related debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. The issuance of debt, common equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of stockholder interests or reduced net income to common stockholders due to additional interest expense or preferred stock dividends. 
 Shelf Registrations 
 The Hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2024 that permits it to offer and sell debt and equity securities during the three-year life of the registration statement. 
 For further information regarding shelf registrations, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Hartford has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") that provides up to 750 of unsecured credit through October 27, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding and no letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants. For further information regarding the Credit Facility, see Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 Intercompany Liquidity Agreements 
 The Company has 2.0 billion available under an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to 2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Department of Insurance ("CTDOI") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1.9 billion was available, 105 was outstanding between certain affiliates, and there were no amounts outstanding at the HFSG Holding Company.

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston 
 The Company s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company Hartford Fire and HLA, are members of the FHLBB. Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. Advances may be used to support general corporate purposes, which would be presented as short- or long-term debt, or to earn incremental investment income, which would be presented in other liabilities consistent with other collateralized financing transactions. As of September 30, 2024, there were no advances outstanding. 
 For further information regarding collateralized advances with FHLBB, see Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 Lloyd's Letter of Credit Facility 
 The Hartford has a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the "Lloyd's Facility"). On October 21, 2024, The Hartford amended and restated its Lloyd s Facility agreement. The amended and restated Lloyd's Facility has two tranches with one tranche extending a 74 commitment and the other tranche extending a 79 million 106 as of September 30, 2024) commitment. As of September 30, 2024, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of 74 and 73 million, or 98, were outstanding under the Lloyd's Facility. 
 
 Among other covenants, the Lloyd's Facility contains financial covenants regarding The Hartford's consolidated net worth and financial leverage. As of September 30, 2024, The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility. 
 For further information regarding the Lloyd's Facility, see Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 
 | PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 
 The Company does not have a 2024 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. Based on the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, the Company does not anticipate contributing to the plan in 2024. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 17 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 | DERIVATIVE COMMITMENTS 
 Certain of the Company s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could terminate agreements and demand immediate settlement of the outstanding net derivative positions transacted under each 

agreement. For further information, refer to Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, no derivative positions would be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings. This could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. 
 
 | INSURANCE OPERATIONS 
 While subject to variability period to period, underwriting and investment cash flows continue to provide sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated demands. 
 The principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from insurance and administrative service agreements and investment income, while investing cash flows primarily originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. 
 The Company s insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as Property Casualty Operations and Group Benefits products. 
 The Company's insurance operations hold fixed maturity securities, including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase), to meet liquidity needs. Liquidity requirements that are unable to be funded by the Company's insurance operations' short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating funds, including premiums or investing cash flows, which includes proceeds received through the sale of invested assets. A sale of invested assets could result in significant realized losses. 
 The following tables represent the fixed maturity holdings, including the aforementioned cash and short-term investments available to meet liquidity needs, for each of the Company s insurance operations. 
 Property Casualty Operations 
 As of September 30, 2024 Fixed maturities 34,591 Short-term investments 2,225 Cash 184 Less: Derivative collateral 65 Total 36,935 
 Property Casualty operations invested assets also include 268 in equity securities, 4.8 billion in mortgage loans and 4.0 billion in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. 
 Group Benefits 
 As of September 30, 2024 Fixed maturities 8,266 Short-term investments 264 Cash 30 Less: Derivative collateral 15 Total 8,545

 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Group Benefits invested assets also include 49 in equity securities, 1.7 billion in mortgage loans and 1.1 billion in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. 
 The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting and insurance operating costs, to pay taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the HFSG Holding Company. 
 Property Casualty reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of September 30, 2024 were 35.7 billion and net of reinsurance were 29.2 billion. Reserves for Property Casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include case reserves and incurred but not reported (" IBNR" reserves. The ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case and IBNR reserves is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future. For a discussion of The Hartford s judgment in estimating reserves for Property Casualty see Part II, Item 7, MD A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report, and for historical payments by reserve line net of reinsurance, see Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. The timing of future payments for the next twelve months and for beyond twelve months could vary materially from historical payment patterns due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of A E claims. 
 Group Benefits reserves as of September 30, 2024 were 8.9 billion and net of reinsurance were 8.6 billion. Group life and disability obligations are estimated using assumptions based on the Company s historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. For a discussion of The Hartford s judgment in estimating reserves for Group Benefits see Part II, Item 7, MD A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Group Benefit Reserves, Net of Reinsurance, in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. For additional information about future policy benefits and other policyholder funds and benefits payable, see Note 10 - Reserve for Future Policy Benefits and Note 11 - Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For historical 

payments by reserve line, net of reinsurance, see Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, payments for the next twelve months and beyond twelve months could materially differ from historical patterns. 
 Corporate includes reserves as of September 30, 2024 were 382 and net of reinsurance were 156. These reserves related to retained run-off liabilities of its former life and annuity business. For additional information about future policy benefits and other policyholder funds and benefits payable, see Note 10 - Reserve for Future Policy Benefits and Note 11 - Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Hartford Funds 
 Hartford Funds' principal sources of operating funds are fees earned from basis points on AUM with uses primarily for payments to subadvisors and other general operating expenses. As of September 30, 2024, Hartford Funds cash and short-term investments were 281. 
 
 | PURCHASE AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS 
 The Hartford s unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, private placements, and mortgage loans are disclosed in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in The Hartford's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. It is anticipated that these unfunded commitments will be funded through the Company s normal operating and investing activities. 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, and information technology. The Company s operating lease commitments are disclosed in Note 21 - Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in The Hartford's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. It is anticipated that these purchase commitments and operating lease obligations will be funded through the Company s normal operating and investing activities.

 Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by an increase in P C and Group Benefits premiums received, a decrease in P C loss and loss adjustment expenses paid due to the 787 payment to the Boy Scouts of America in the prior year, partially offset by higher operating expenses, including increased commissions and staffing costs, an increase in Group Benefits loss and loss adjustment expenses paid, and taxes paid. 
 Cash used for investing activities increased in 2024 as compared to the prior year driven by a decrease in net proceeds from equity securities at fair value, a decrease in net proceeds from short term investments, and an increase in net payments for mortgage loans, partially offset by a change from net payments for to net proceeds from derivatives and a decrease in net payments for partnerships. 

Cash used for financing activities increased in 2024 as compared to the prior year period driven by an increase in treasury stock acquired, an increase in dividends paid on common stock, and an increase in net outflows on investment and universal life type contracts, partially offset by a decrease in net issuance of shares under incentive and stock compensation plans. 
 Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 has been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.

| RATINGS 
 Ratings are an important factor in establishing a competitive position in the insurance marketplace and impact the Company's ability to access financing and its cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the Company s ratings will continue for any given period of time, or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company s ratings are downgraded, the Company s competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted. 
 These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of The Hartford's securities and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the rating organization. Each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating. The system and the number of rating categories can vary across rating agencies. 
 Among other factors, rating agencies consider the level of statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as well as the level of GAAP capital held by the Company in determining the Company's financial strength and credit ratings. Rating agencies may implement changes to their capital formulas that have the effect of increasing the amount of capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. See Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 For a discussion regarding legislative and regulatory developments, see Part II, Item 7, MD A - Capital Resources and Liquidity, Contingencies in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report. 
 Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has issued final rules to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures for investors. The SEC rules are being challenged in the courts, and on April 4, 2024 the SEC voluntarily stayed the rules pending judicial review. If they become operative in their current form, the rules will require extensive narrative and quantitative reporting on climate change and decarbonization in SEC filings and financial statements and pose potential compliance and regulatory risks to the Company, beginning in fiscal year 2025. The State of California has enacted laws that impose similarly extensive compliance burdens on the Company, entailing like compliance and regulatory risks. Other jurisdictions may follow suit. However, the California laws are facing legal challenges as well and the overall state of these types of climate related disclosure regimes, whether at the state or federal level, remains uncertain.
