ITEM 2. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

We have made forward-looking statements in this document, and in documents that we may incorporate by reference, that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information concerning
 possible or expected future results of operations of Citizens Financial Services, Inc., CZFS Acquisition Company, LLC, First Citizens Community Bank, First Citizens Insurance Agency, Inc., 1 st Realty of PA LLC or the combined Company. When we use words such as believes, expects, anticipates, or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. For a variety of reasons, actual results
 could differ materially from those contained in or implied by forward-looking statements. The Company cautions readers that the following important factors, among others, could in the future affect the Company s actual results and could cause the
 Company s actual results for subsequent periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement:

Interest rates could change more rapidly or more significantly than we expect or the yield curve could remain inverted for a longer period than anticipated.

The economy could change significantly in an unexpected way, which would cause the demand for new loans and the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans to change in ways that our models do not anticipate.

The financial markets could suffer a significant disruption, which may have a negative effect on our financial condition and that of our borrowers, and on our ability to raise money by issuing new securities.

It could take us longer than we anticipate implementing strategic initiatives, including expansions, designed to increase revenues or manage expenses, or we may be unable to implement those initiatives at all.

Acquisitions and dispositions of assets and companies could affect us in ways that management has not anticipated.

We may become subject to new legal obligations or the resolution of litigation may have a negative effect on our financial condition or operating results.

We may become subject to new and unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory or compliance practices or requirements. Failure to comply with any one or more of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations.

We could experience greater loan delinquencies than anticipated, adversely affecting our earnings and financial condition.

We could experience greater losses than expected due to the ever-increasing volume of information theft and fraudulent scams impacting our customers and the banking industry.

We could lose the services of some or all of our key personnel, which would negatively impact our business because of their business development skills, financial expertise, lending experience, technical expertise and market area
 knowledge.

The agricultural economy is subject to extreme swings in both the costs of resources and the prices received from the sale of products as a result of weather , government regulations, international trade
 agreements and consumer tastes, which could negatively impact certain of our customers. 

Loan concentrations in certain industries could negatively impact our results, if financial results or economic conditions deteriorate.

Companies providing support services related to the e xploration and drilling of the natural gas reserves in our market area may be affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations such as
 restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes and environmental protection, which could negatively impact our customers and, as a result, negatively impact our loan and deposit volume and loan quality. Additionally, the
 activities the companies providing support services related to the exploration and drilling of the natural gas reserves may be dependent on the market price of natural gas. As a result, decreases in the market price of natural gas could
 also negatively impact these companies, our customers. 

34 

Index 

Additional factors that may affect our results are discussed under Part II Item 1A Risk Factors in this report and in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1.A/ Risk Factors. Except as
 required by applicable law and regulation, we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date on which they are made.

Critical Accounting Policies 

See Note 1, "Basis of Presentation" for additional information on the adoption of ASC 326, which changes the methodology under which management calculates its reserve for loans and investment securities, now referred
 to as the allowance for credit losses. Management considers the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting policy.

Introduction 

The following is management's discussion and analysis of the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations at the dates and for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
 statements for the Company. Our consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. Management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
 the preceding financial statements presented under Part I and the Company s audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for the
 three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results you may expect for the full year.

The Company engages in the general business of banking throughout our service area of Potter, Tioga, Clinton, Bradford, Lycoming and Centre counties in north central Pennsylvania, Lebanon, Berks, Schuylkill, Lancaster
 and Chester counties in south central Pennsylvania and Allegany County in southern New York and with the MidCoast acquisition, the Cities of Wilmington and Dover, Delaware. We also have a limited branch office in Union county, Pennsylvania, which
 primarily serves agricultural and commercial customers in the central Pennsylvania market. With the HVBC acquisition, we have expanded further into southeast Pennsylvania, including Montgomery, Bucks and
 Philadelphia Counties as well as Burlington County, New Jersey through the acquisition of five full service branaches, four mortgage centers and one business banking facility. We maintain our central office in Mansfield, Pennsylvania.
 Presently we operate 47 banking facilities, 39 of which operate as bank branches. In Pennsylvania, the Company has full service offices located in Mansfield, Blossburg, Ulysses, Genesee, Wellsboro, Troy, Sayre, Canton, Gillett, Millerton,
 LeRaysville, Towanda, Rome, the Mansfield Wal-Mart Super Center, Mill Hall, Williamsport, Schuylkill Haven, Friedensburg, Mt. Aetna, Fredericksburg, Mount Joy, Ephrata, Fivepointville, State College, Kennett Square, Warrington, Plumsteadville,
 Philadelphia, two branches near the city of Lebanon and two branches in Huntington Valley. The limited branch office is located in Winfield, Pennsylvania. In New York, our office is in Wellsville. In Delaware, we have three branches in Wilmington
 and one in Dover. The mortgage centers acquired as part of the acquisition are located in Huntington Valley, PA, Philadelphia, PA and Mount Laurel, NJ. The business banking facility is located in Philadelphia, PA. The Company received regulatory
 approval to open a limited purpose banking office in Georgetown, Delaware that was opened in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, the mortgage center located in Montgomeryville, PA was closed.

Risk Management 

Risk identification and management are essential elements for the successful management of the Company. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various types of risk, including interest rate,
 credit, liquidity, reputational and regulatory risk.

35 

Index 

Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of financial instruments to the direction, frequency and magnitude of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk results from
 various re-pricing frequencies and the maturity structure of the financial instruments owned by the Company. The Company uses its asset/liability and funds management policy to control and manage interest rate risk.

Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk results from loans with customers and the purchase of securities from an issuer. The Company s
 primary credit risk is in the loan portfolio. The Company manages credit risk by adhering to an established credit policy and through a disciplined evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Also, the investment policy limits
 the amount of credit risk that may be taken in the investment portfolio.

Liquidity risk represents the inability to generate or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers and obligations to depositors. The Company has established guidelines within its
 asset/liability and funds management policy to manage liquidity risk. These guidelines include, among other things, contingent funding alternatives.

Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and
 regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information, including fraudulent activity outside the Company s control. We expend significant resources to comply
 with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our
 earnings and liquidity.

Regulatory and compliance risk represents the possibility that a change in law, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the business of the Company. We cannot predict what legislation might be
 enacted or what regulations might be adopted, or if adopted, the effect thereof on our operations.

Competition 

The banking industry in the Bank s service areas continue to be extremely competitive for loans and deposits, both among commercial banks and with other financial service providers such as consumer
 finance companies, thrifts, investment firms, mutual funds, insurance companies, credit unions, agricultural cooperatives and internet entities. Competition in our north central Pennsylvania market has increased as a result of other financial
 institutions expanding looking to expand into new markets. With larger population centers in our central, south central and south east Pennsylvania markets, as well as in our Delaware market, we experience more competition to gather deposits and to
 make loans. Mortgage banking firms, financial companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies, brokerage firms, retirement fund management firms and even government agencies provide additional competition for loans, deposits and other
 financial services. Fintech and blockchain entities offering crypto services are also increasing competition for the Company s financial services. The Bank is generally competitive with all competing financial institutions in its service areas with
 respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans.

Trust and Investment Services; Oil and Gas Lease Services 

Our Investment and Trust Services Division offers professional trust administration, investment management services, estate planning and administration, and custody of securities. In

addition to traditional trust and investment services offered, we assist our customers through various oil and gas specific leasing matters from lease negotiations to establishing a successful approach to personal wealth management. Assets

held by the Company in a fiduciary or agency capacity for its customers are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets since such items are not assets of the Company. Revenues and fees of the Trust Department are reflected in trust income in
 the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Trust Department had 181.1 million and 167.9 million of assets under management, respectively.

36 

Index 

Our Investment Representatives offer full service brokerage services and financial planning throughout the Bank s market area. Products such as mutual funds, annuities, health and life insurance are made available
 through our insurance subsidiary, First Citizens Insurance Agency, Inc. The assets associated with these products are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets since such assets are not assets of the Company. Assets owned and invested by
 customers of the Bank through the Bank s Investment Representatives increased from 329.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 388.6 million at September 30, 2024. Fee income from the sale of these products is reflected in brokerage and insurance
 income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Management believes that there are opportunities to increase non-interest income through these products and services, especially in our central, south central and south eastern Pennsylvania markets.

Results of Operations 

Overview of the Income Statement

The Company had net income of 19,835,000 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 10,271,000 for last year s comparable period, an increase of 9,564,000, or 93.1 , primarily due to the absence
 in the current period of one-time costs associated with the HVBC acquisition and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Basic earnings per share for the first nine months of 2024 were 4.18, compared to 2.38 for last year s comparable
 period, representing a 75.6 increase. Annualized return on assets and return on equity for the nine months of 2024 were 0.88 and 8.45 , respectively, compared with 0.53 and 6.56 for last year s comparable period.

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7,536,000 compared to 7,548,000 in the comparable 2023 period, a decrease of 12,000. Basic earnings per share for the three months ended
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.59. Annualized return on assets and return on equity for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 1.00 and 9.53 , respectively, compared with 1.02 and 10.10 for the same 2023 period.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, the most significant component of the Company s earnings, is the amount by which interest income generated from interest-earning assets exceeds interest expense paid on interest-bearing
 liabilities.

Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 63,582,000, an increase of 5,177,000, or 8.9 , compared to the same period in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024 the provision for credit losses was
 2,587,000. The provision for the first nine months of 2023 was 5,328,000, which included 4,591,000 for non-PCD loans acquired as part of the acquisition. Excluding the 4,591,000 related to the acquisition, the provision for credit losses
 increased 1,850,000. Consequently, net interest income after the provision for credit losses was 60,995,000 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 53,077,000 during the first nine months of 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 21,324,000 compared to 22,404,000, a decrease of 1,080,000, or 4.8 , over the comparable period in 2023. The provision for credit losses in the
 third quarter of 2024 was 200,000) compared to 475,000 in 2023. Consequently, net interest income after the provision for credit losses was 21,524,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21,929,000 in 2023.

Income on non-accrual loans is accounted for on a cash basis, and the loan balances are included in interest-earning assets.

(5)

Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.

Tax exempt revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) for proper comparison using a federal statutory income tax rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For purposes of
 the comparison, as well as the discussion that follows, this presentation facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax-free assets by increasing the tax-free income by an amount equivalent to the Federal income taxes that would have
 been paid if this income were taxable at the Company s Federal statutory rate during the corresponding period. The following table represents the adjustment to convert net interest income to net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis
 for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

The portion of the total change attributable to both volume and rate changes, which can not be separated, has been allocated proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to rate prior to allocation.

Tax equivalent net interest income increased from 59,207,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 to 64,324,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of
 5,117,000. The acquisition of HVBC had a substantial impact on the increase. The tax equivalent net interest margin decreased from 3.23 for the first nine months of 2023 to 3.09 for the comparable period in 2024. The decrease is primarily caused
 by the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities due to higher market interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023.

40

Total tax equivalent interest income for the 2024 nine month period increased 25,858,000 as compared to the 2023 nine month period. This increase was a result of an increase of 17,630,000 due to a
 change in volume as average interest-bearing assets increased 345.6 million. As a result of the higher market interest rate environment, the yield on average interest earning assets increased 0.63 from 4.91 to 5.54 resulting in an increase in
 interest income of 8,228,000.

Tax equivalent investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 23,000 over the same period last year. The primary cause of the increase was due to the increase in yield on

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 2,587,000, which represents a decrease of 2,741,000 from the 5,328,000 provision recorded in the corresponding nine
 months of last year. The provision for 2023 includes 4,591,000 associated with the HVBC acquisition and 162,000 as a provision for off-balance sheet items, which is also primarily attributable to the HVBC acquisition. Excluding these items, the
 provision for 2024 is 1,850,000 more than the comparable period in 2023 and is due to an increase in non-performing other commercial loans that were originated by HVBC that subsequent to the acquisition have deteriorated. The provision in 2024 is
 also higher due to an increase in past due and non-accrual loans, the vast majority of which were acquired as part of the HVBC acquisition, and an increase in classified loans. (see Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit
 Quality Risk ).

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 200,000), which represents a decrease of 675,000 from the 475,000 provision recorded in the corresponding three months of

Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 12,062,000, an increase of 3,946,000 when compared to the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30,
 2024, non-interest income increased 93,000 to 3,755,000. During the first nine months of 2024, net equity security gains amounted to 127,000 as a result of market gains associated with general banking stock gains compared with a 223,000 loss
 in the comparable 2023 period associated with market conditions for that period. There were no sales of available for sale securities during the first nine months of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were 51,000 of
 losses from the sale of 10.0 million available for sale municipal securities. Additionally, 76.5 million of securities obtained as part of the acquisition were sold for no gain or loss during the second quarter of 2023.

The increase in gains on loans sold for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is attributable the HVBC acquisition and their residential lending model, which focused on
 originating and selling residential mortgage loans, which includes the use of interest rate locks and other derivative activities, which is included in other income. The increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance is due to the HVBC
 acquisition. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of certain assets acquired as part of the HVB acquisition, which included loans and accrued interest, and software, as well as transferring certain contracts, processes
 and employees of a division internally known as Braavo. The proceeds from the sale totaled approximately 7.2 million and generated a pre-tax gain of approximately 1.1 million.

Non-interest expenses increased 16,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Salaries and employee benefits increased 4,024,000 or 15.7 . The increase
 was due to merit increases effective at the beginning of 2024, additional full time equivalent employees (FTE) of 48.0, which is an increase of 13.9 , and an increase in health care expenses due to higher claims on the Company s partially
 self-funded plan and the additional headcount. 

The decrease in merger and acquisition expenses was due to the absence in the current period of fees associated with the acquisition of HVB that closed in June 2023 and includes severance costs,
 change in control payments, contract termination payments and various professional and consulting fees. The increase in occupancy, furniture and fixtures, amortization of intangibles, and software expenses was due to the HVBC acquisition. The
 increase in FDIC insurance is due to the acquisition and organic growth. Other expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition, with increases experienced in subscriptions, marketing and advertising, postage, printing, data communication
 expenses and FHLB letter of credit fees. Independent of the acquisition, other expenses increased due to insurance reimbursement received in 2023 to cover amounts previously charged-off.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expenses decreased 415,000 when compared to the same period in 2023. Salaries and benefits decreased 290,000 due to a decrease in headcount of 4.4 FTEs and
 commission expense for the comparable periods. The changes in merger and acquisition expenses, FDIC insurance and other expenses correspond to the changes for the nine month period.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was 4,304,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,020,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in income
 before the provision for income taxes of 11,848,000 for the comparable periods due to the one-time costs associated with the HVBC acquisition. Through management of our municipal loan and bond portfolios, management is focused on minimizing our
 effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 17.8 and 16.4 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to the statutory rate of 21 .

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for income taxes was 1,714,000 compared to 1,599,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase is attributable to an increase in income before income tax
 of 103,000 and earnings on bank owned life insurance being exempt from Federal income tax. Our effective tax rate was 18.5 and 17.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We are invested in seven limited partnerships that have established low-income housing projects in our market areas, with our most recent investments made in the second half of 2022. Three projects are currently in
 construction phase with credits being recognized on two of the projects for the first time in 2023 with the expectation that the remaining one will generate credits in the second half of 2024. The remaining four partnership credits are fully
 utilized as of December 31, 2023. We anticipate recognizing an aggregate of 8.2 million of tax credits over the next 12 years.

Index 

Financial Condition 

Total assets were 3.03 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 51.1 million from 2.98 billion at December 31, 2023, due primarily to increases in loans. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 16.1 million to
 36.8 million. Available for sale securities increased 1.6 million. Total deposits increased 128.7 million to 2.45 billion since year-end 2023, while borrowed funds decreased 90.3 million to 231.7 million.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents totaled 36.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 52.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to a decrease in the cash held at the Federal Reserve. Management actively
 measures and evaluates the Company s liquidity position through our Asset Liability Committee and believes the Company s liquidity needs are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional
 funding sources including the Bank s core deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank financing, federal funds lines with correspondent banks, brokered certificates of deposit and the portion of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year. 
 Management expects that these sources of funds will permit us to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they come due.

Our investment portfolio increased by 1.4 million, or 0.3 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. During 2024, we purchased 36.2 million of mortgage-backed securities in U.S government sponsored entities. We
 experienced 8.9 million of principal repayments and 33.8 million of calls and maturities. As a result of decreases in market interest rates, the unrealized loss on available for sale investment portfolio decreased 9.2 million. Excluding our
 short-term investments consisting of monies held primarily at the Federal Reserve for liquidity purposes, our investment portfolio for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 yielded 2.36 , compared to 2.18 in the comparable period in 2023,
 on a tax equivalent basis.

Index 

The investment strategy for 2024 has been to utilize cashflows from the investment portfolio to repay overnight borrowings, while reinvesting certain balances. We continually monitor interest rate trading ranges and
 seek to time investment security purchases when rates are in the top third of the trading range. The Company believes its investment strategy has appropriately mitigated its interest rate risk exposure for various rate environments, including a
 rising rate environment, while providing sufficient cashflows to meet liquidity needs.

Management continues to monitor the earnings performance and the liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis. Through active balance sheet management and analysis of the investment portfolio, the
 Company believes it maintains sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor withdrawal requirements and various credit needs of its customers.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale increased 4.1 million to 13.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 due to the third quarter typically being more active for residential home sales than the fourth quarter.

Lending efforts have historically been focused in north central Pennsylvania, the south central Pennsylvania counties of Lebanon, Schuylkill, Berks and Lancaster, the central Pennsylvania counties of Clinton and
 Centre, and southern New York. We have a limited branch office in Union County that is staffed by a lending team to primarily support agricultural opportunities in central Pennsylvania. In April 2020, we completed the MidCoast acquisition, which
 expanded our markets into the State of Delaware with activity centered around the cities of Wilmington and Dover, Delaware. Since the MidCoast acquisition, we have opened two additional branches in the Delaware market to better serve customers in
 the Wilmington market, as well as the surrounding area of Chester County, Pennsylvania. In June 2023, we completed the HVBC acquisition, which expanded our markets into south east Pennsylvania, including the counties of Montgomery, Bucks and
 Philadelphia. It also includes a Mortgage production office in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we opened an office in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to further our efforts in central Pennsylvania. We originate loans
 primarily through direct loans to our existing customer base, with new customers generated through the strong relationships our lending teams have with their customers and our lenders expertise in certain areas, as well as by referrals from real
 estate brokers, building contractors, attorneys, accountants, corporate and advisory board members, existing customers and the Bank s website. The Bank offers a variety of loans although historically most of our lending has focused on real
 estate loans including residential, commercial, agricultural, and construction loans. All lending is governed by a lending policy that is developed and administered by management and approved by the Board of Directors.

Loan activity picked up slightly during the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in construction loans was due to the underlying projects being completed and transferred to the commercial and agricultural real estate
 portfolios. As part of the Braavo sale, we sold 6.1 million of other commercial loans. Due to timing, student loans increased in the first half of 2024 resulting in an increase in consumer loans.

The federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained
 in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land acquisitions which represent 100 or
 more of an institution s total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300 or more of the institution s total risk-based capital and the institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 
 or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of
 risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has
 experienced growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of September 30, 2024, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represented 301.5 of consolidated
 risk based capital. Construction, land and land development loans represented 62.8 of consolidated risk based capital as of September 30, 2024. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending and has implemented and
 continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. We may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate
 concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company has an extensive Capital Policy and Capital Plan, which includes pro-forma projections including stress testing within
 which the Board of Directors has established internal minimum targets for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios. The Company continues to refine information reviewed related to commercial real estate and to
 implement additional monitoring and testing of commercial real estate loans. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that it has implemented appropriate risk management practices, including risk assessments, board-approved underwriting
 policies and related procedures, which include monitoring loan portfolio performance and stressing of the commercial real estate portfolio under adverse economic conditions.

The Company obtains an appraisal of the real estate collateral securing a CRE loan prior to originating the loan. The appraised value is used to calculate the ratio of the outstanding loan balance to the value of the
 real estate collateral, or loan-to-value ratio ("LTV"). The original appraisal is used to monitor the LTVs within the CRE portfolio unless an updated appraisal is received, which may happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to
 payment delinquency, additional loan requests using the same collateral, and loan modifications. The following table presents the ranges in the LTVs of our CRE loans at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

While the Company lends to companies that service companies that explore for natural gas in our market area, the Company has not originated any loans to companies performing the actual drilling and exploration
 activities. Loans made by the Company are to service industry customers which include trucking companies, stone quarries and other support businesses, favoring customers that have had a relationship with the Company prior to supporting the
 exploration for natural gas. We also have originated loans to businesses and individuals for restaurants, hotels and apartment rentals that have been developed and expanded to meet the housing and living needs of the gas industry workers. Due to
 our understanding of the industry and its cyclical nature, the loans made for natural gas-related activities have been originated in accordance with specific policies and procedures for lending to these entities, which include more stringent loan
 to value thresholds, shortened amortization periods, and expansion of our monitoring of loan concentrations associated with this activity.

For loans sold on the secondary market, the Company recognizes fee income for servicing certain sold loans, which is included in non-interest income.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans

The allowance for credit losses - loans is maintained at a level which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses - loans is charged against
 current income. Loans deemed not collectable are charged-off against the allowance while subsequent recoveries increase the allowance. The allowance for credit losses - loans was 21,695,000 or 0.93 of total loans as of September 30, 2024 as
 compared to 21,153,000 or 0.94 of loans as of December 31, 2023. The 542,000 increase is a result of a 3,086,000 provision for credit losses loans less net charge-offs of 2,544,000. Net charge-offs for 2024 are driven by loans acquired as
 part of the HVBC acquisition due to collateral issues. The following table shows the distribution of the allowance for credit losses - loans and the percentage of loans compared to total loans by loan category as of September 30, 2024 and

The Company believes it utilizes a disciplined and thorough loan review process based upon its internal loan policy approved by the Company s Board of Directors. The purpose of the review is to assess loan quality,
 analyze delinquencies, identify problem loans, evaluate potential charge-offs and recoveries, and assess general overall economic conditions in the markets served. An external independent loan review is performed on our commercial portfolio at
 least semi-annually for the Company. The external consultant is engaged to 1) review a minimum of 50 of the dollar volume of the commercial loan portfolio on an annual basis, 2) a large sample of relationships in
 aggregate over 1,000,000, 3) selected loan relationships over 750,000 which are over 30 days past due, or classified Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss, and 4) such other loans which management or the consultant deems appropriate.
 As part of this review, our underwriting process and loan grading system is evaluated.

Management believes it uses the best information available to make such determinations and that the allowance for credit losses - loans is adequate as of September 30, 2024. However, future adjustments could be
 required if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions and estimates used in making the initial determination. A prolonged downturn in the economy, changes in the economies of various segments of our agricultural and commercial
 portfolios, high unemployment rates, significant changes in the value of collateral and delays in receiving financial information from borrowers could result in increased levels of non-performing assets, charge-offs, credit loss provisions and
 reduction in income. Additionally, bank regulatory agencies periodically examine the Bank s allowance for credit losses. The banking agencies could require the recognition of additions to the allowance for credit losses - loans based upon their
 judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Index 

On a monthly basis, problem loans are identified and updated primarily using internally prepared past due reports. Based on data surrounding the collection process of each identified loan, the loan may be added or
 deleted from the monthly watch list. The watch list includes loans graded special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss, as well as additional loans that management may choose to include. Watch list loans are continually monitored going
 forward until satisfactory conditions exist that allow management to upgrade and remove the loan from the watchlist. In certain cases, loans may be placed on non-accrual status or charged-off based upon management s evaluation of the borrower s
 ability to pay. All commercial loans, which include commercial real estate, agricultural real estate, state and political subdivision loans, other commercial loans and other agricultural loans, on non-accrual are evaluated quarterly for
 impairment.

 outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending upon management's assessment of its ultimate ability to collect principal and interest.

Nonperforming loans increased 8.9 million during 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank placed five large commercial relationships and one large construction
 relationship on non-accrual status, while also foreclosing on one construction loan that was transferred to foreclosed assets held for sale, which accounts for the majority of the change in non-performing loans since year-end. At
 September 30, 2024, approximately 15.7 million, or 72.8 , of the Bank s non-performing loans are associated with the following nine customer relationships:

A commercial loan relationship with 559,000 outstanding, and additional letters of credit of 1.2 million available, secured by undeveloped land, stone quarries and equipment, was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The
 Company services the natural gas industry, as well as local municipalities. As a result, the reduced exploration for natural gas in north central Pennsylvania has significantly impacted the cash flows of the customer, who provides
 excavation services and stone for pad construction related to these activities. During 2020, the Company had the underlying equipment collateral appraised and in the first quarter of 2022, the Company had the quarry appraised. The
 appraisals indicated a decrease in collateral values compared to the appraisal ordered for the loan origination, however, the loan was still considered well secured on a loan to value basis at September 30, 2024. In 2022 and 2023, the
 customer liquidated some excess equipment and the funds have been utilized to pay down a portion of the loans. Management determined that no specific reserve was required as of September 30, 2024.

An agricultural loan customer with a total loan relationship of 1.3 million, secured by real estate, equipment and cattle, was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The customer declared bankruptcy during the fourth quarter
 of 2018 and developed a workout plan that was approved by the bankruptcy court in the fourth quarter of 2019 and resulted in monthly payments resuming in late 2019 that continued through 2023. The customer did miss a portion of required
 payments in 2023, however, in January 2024 the customer modified the bankruptcy plan to account for these missed payments. The customer will exit bankruptcy during the fourth quarter of 2024. Included within these loans to this customer
 are loans which are subject to Farm Service Agency guarantees in excess of 700,000. Depressed milk prices created cash flow difficulties for this customer. Absent a sizable and sustained increase in milk prices, which is not assured, we
 will need to rely upon the collateral for repayment of interest and principal. During 2023, the Company had the underlying collateral appraised. Management determined that no specific reserve was required as of September 30, 2024.

An agricultural loan customer with a total loan relationship of 1.1 million, secured by real estate was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The customer filed bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2023 with the plan approved
 in the second quarter of 2024. The first payment under the plan was received in the second quarter of 2024 with additional payments received in the third quarter. We expect that we will need to rely upon the collateral for repayment of
 interest and principal. During 2023, the Company had the underlying collateral appraised. Management reviewed the collateral and determined that no specific reserve was required as of September 30, 2024.

53 

Index 

A commercial construction loan customer with a total loan relationship of 1.9 million, secured by partially developed real estate, was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The customer has experienced delays in developing
 the real estate for resale resulting in financing difficulties. Management reviewed the collateral and determined that no specific reserve was required as of September 30, 2024.

A commercial and residential real estate customer with a total relationship of 1.2 million secured by a restaurant and residence was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The customer has experienced a slow-down in business
 at the restaurant as well as higher operating costs creating cashflow difficulties. Management reviewed the collateral and determined that a specific reserve of 60,000 was required as of September 30, 2024.

A commercial loan relationship with 1.7 million outstanding secured by residential and commercial real estate, a car collection and gun collection was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The Company lost a contract and has
 gone out of business. We expect that we will need to rely upon the collateral for repayment of interest and principal. Management reviewed the collateral and determined that a specific reserve of 355,000 was required as of September 30,
 2024.

A commercial real estate customer with a total relationship of 3.9 million secured by commercial real estate was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The loan to the customer matured during the second quarter of 2024 and no
 interest payments were made on the loan through September 30, 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, a new loan was underwritten and approved for the customer, which required the payment of all past due payments of principal and
 interest. Management reviewed the collateral and determined that no specific reserve was required as of September 30, 2024.

A commercial real estate customer with a total relationship of 2.9 million secured by commercial real estate was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The loan to the customer matured during the second quarter of 2024. The
 customer has a signed sales agreement that is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Management reviewed the collateral and determined that no specific reserve was required as of September 30, 2024.

A commercial real estate customer with a total relationship of 1.2 million secured by commercial real estate was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. The loan to the customer matured during the second quarter of 2024. An
 extension for this loan is under consideration and being negotiated with the customer that would require the payment of all past due payments of principal and interest and an extending the maturity date. Management reviewed the collateral
 and determined that no specific reserve was required as of September 30, 2024.

Management believes that the allowance for credit losses - loans at September 30, 2024 was adequate at that date, which was based on the following factors:

Nine loan relationships comprise 72.8 of the non-performing loan balance, which required a specific reserve of 415,000 as of September 30, 2024.

The Company has a history of low charge-offs, which were 0.15 of average loans on an annualized basis for 2024 and 0.09 for 2023.

Bank Owned Life Insurance

The Company owns bank owned life insurance policies to offset future employee benefit costs. These policies provide the Bank with an asset that generates earnings to partially offset the current costs of benefits,
 and eventually (at the death of the insureds) provide partial recovery of cash outflows associated with the benefits. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the cash surrender value of the life insurance was 50.1 million and 49.9
 million, respectively. The change in cash surrender value, net of purchases and amounts acquired through acquisitions, is recognized in the results of operations. The amounts recorded as non-interest income totaled 1,334,000 and 941,000 for the
 nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company received proceeds of 1,147,000, which included death benefits of 326,000 on a former employee of the Company. The Company
 evaluates annually the risks associated with the life insurance policies, including limits on the amount of coverage and an evaluation of the various carriers credit ratings.

The Company policies that were purchased directly from insurance companies and acquired as part of the HVBC acquisition are structured so that any death benefits received from a policy while the insured person is an
 active employee of the Bank will be split with the beneficiary of the policy. Under these agreements, the employee s beneficiary will be entitled to receive 50 of the net amount at risk from the proceeds. The net amount at risk is the total
 death benefit payable less the cash surrender value of the policy as of the date of death. The policies acquired as part of the acquisition of FNB provide a fixed split-dollar benefit for the beneficiary s estate, which is dependent on several
 factors including whether the covered individual was a former Director of First National Bank of Fredericksburg FNB or a former employee of FNB and their salary level. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, included in other
 liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was a liability of 566,000 and 610,000, respectively, for the obligation under the split-dollar benefit agreements.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment decreased 147,000 to 21.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 as a result of depreciation.

Other assets

Other assets decreased 11.3 million to 47.7 million. The primary driver of the decrease was an investment security that matured, but did not settle as of December 31, 2023. It subsequently settled in 2024.

Deposits increased 128.7 million since December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits was driven by increases in state and political organizations and timing of their tax receipts and an increase in brokered deposits
 of 32.3 million. We continue to see customer funds being transferred to higher-yielding investment alternatives. Brokered deposits totaled 141.6 million and 109.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Bank estimates that balances held by customers in excess of the FDIC insurance limit 250,000 per insured account) totaled 1.24 billion, or 50.5 of the Bank s total deposits. Included in this balance are balances held through Intrafi, which provides customers with additional FDIC insurance, as well as deposits collateralized by securities 
 or letters of credit (almost exclusively municipal deposits). The total of these items was 695.0 million, or 28.4 of the Bank s total deposits, as of
 September 30, 2024. 

Borrowed Funds

Borrowed funds were 231.7 million and 322.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in borrowed funds was due to the decrease in loans and the seasonal increase in
 deposits.

In April 2020, the Bank entered into two interest rate swap agreements to convert floating-rate debt to fixed rate debt on notional amounts of 15.0 million and 10.0 million. The interest rate swap instruments
 involve an agreement to receive a floating rate and pay a fixed rate, at specified intervals, calculated on the agreed-upon notional amounts. The differentials paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to
 interest expense in the period. The interest rate swap agreements were entered into on April 1, 2020 and expire on April 1, 2025 and April 1, 2027. In April 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert floating-rate
 debt to fixed rate debt on a notional amounts of 7.5 million. The interest rate swap instrument involves an agreement to receive a floating rate and pay a fixed rate, at specified intervals, calculated on the agreed-upon notional amount. The
 differentials paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in the period. The interest rate swap agreements were entered into on April 13, 2020 and expire on June 17, 2027. In May of 2020,
 the Bank entered into three two year forward interest rate swaps that will convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt on notional amounts of 6.0 million each. The interest rate swap instruments involves an agreement to receive a floating
 rate and pay a fixed rate, at specified intervals, calculated on the agreed-upon notional amount. The differentials paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in the period. The interest
 rate swap agreements were entered into on May 14, 2020 and expire on May 14, 2027, 2029 and 2032. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at September 30, 2024 was 3,828,000 and is included within fair value of derivative instruments on the
 consolidated balance sheets.

The Company s current strategy for borrowings is to consider terms and structures to manage interest rate risk and liquidity in a declining rate environment. The Company's daily cash requirements or short-term
 investments are primarily met by using the financial instruments available through the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.

Stockholders Equity

We evaluate stockholders equity in relation to total assets and the risks associated with those assets. The greater the capital resource, the more likely a corporation will meet its cash obligations and absorb
 unforeseen losses. For these reasons, capital adequacy has been, and will continue to be, of paramount importance to the Company. As such, the Company has implemented policies and procedures to ensure that it has adequate capital levels. As part
 of this process, we routinely stress test our capital levels and identify potential risk and alternative sources of additional capital should the need arise.

Total stockholders equity was 298.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 279.7 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 18,988,000, or 6.8 . Excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss, stockholders 
 equity increased 13.0 million, or 4.3 . The accumulated comprehensive loss decreased 6.0 million, which was primarily the result of the increase in fair value of the Company s available for sale investment portfolio caused by the decrease in
 longer term market interest rates. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company had net income of 19.8 million and declared cash dividends of 7.0 million, or 1.46 per share, representing a cash dividend payout ratio of 35.1 .

All of the Company s debt investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, making this portion of the Company s balance sheet more sensitive to the changing market value of investments due to changes in
 market interest rates. As a result of decreases in longer term market interest rates, the defined benefit plan obligations and the interest rate swaps entered into during 2020, accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased approximately 6.0
 million from December 31, 2023.

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory-and possibly additional
 discretionary-actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet
 specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under U.S. GAAP, regulatory reporting requirements, and regulatory capital standards. The Bank s
 capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulatory capital standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital
 (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined) to total risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). As permitted by applicable
 federal regulation, the Bank has opted to use the community bank leverage ratio (the CBLR framework for determining its capital adequacy. Under the CBLR framework a qualifying community bank is considered well-capitalized if its leverage
 ratio (Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets) exceeds 9 . There is a two quarter grace period for a qualifying community bank to return to 9 as long as the CBLR is least 8 . If a qualifying community bank fails to maintain
 the applicable minimum CBLR during the grace period, or if it is unable to restore compliance with the CBLR within the grace period, then it will revert to the Basel III capital framework and the normal Prompt Corrective Action capital categories
 will apply. At September 30, 2024, the Bank leverage ratio under the CBLR framework was 8.96 , which is less than 9.0 requirement to be considered well-capitalized under the CBLR. As such, as of September 30, 2024, and going forward, the Bank
 reverted to the prompt corrective action framework and will no longer utilize the CBLR framework until such time as the CBLR exceeds 9 . The following table provides the Bank s computed risk based capital ratios as of September 30, 2024, which
 reflects the Bank being well capitalized on that date (dollars in thousands):

We also offer limited overdraft protection as a non-contractual courtesy which is available to demand deposit accounts in good standing. Overdraft charges as a result of ATM withdrawals and one-time point of sale
 (non-recurring) transactions require prior approval of the customer. The non-contractual amount of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 13,025,000 and 13,121,000, respectively. The
 Company reserves the right to discontinue this service without prior notice.

Liquidity

Liquidity is a measure of the Company's ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors. To maintain proper liquidity, we use funds management policies, which include
 liquidity target ratios, along with our investment policies to assure we can meet our financial obligations to depositors, credit customers and stockholders. Liquidity is needed to meet depositors' withdrawal demands, extend credit to meet
 borrowers' needs, provide funds for normal operating expenses and cash dividends, and to fund other capital expenditures.

Cash generated by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities influences liquidity management. Our Company's historical activity in this area can be seen in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
 Flows. The most important source of funds is core deposits. Repayment of principal on outstanding loans and cash flows created from the investment portfolio are also factors in liquidity management. Other sources of funding include brokered
 certificates of deposit and the sale of loans or investments, if needed.

58 

Index 

The Company's use of funds is shown in the investing activity section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, where the net loan activity is presented. Other uses of funds include purchasing stock from the
 Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh, as well as capital expenditures. Capital expenditures (including software purchases), during the first nine months of 2024 were 852,000 compared to 2,308,000 during the same time period in 2023.

Short-term debt from the FHLB supplements the Bank s availability of funds. The Bank achieves liquidity primarily from temporary or short term investments in the Federal Reserve and the
 FHLB. The Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity at the FHLB of approximately 1.07 billion, of which 384.8 million was outstanding, at September 30, 2024. The Bank also has two federal funds line with third party providers for 34.0 million as
 of September 30, 2024, which are unsecured and were undrawn upon as of September 30, 2024. The Company also has a borrower in custody line with the Federal Reserve Bank of approximately 14.2 million, which also was not drawn upon as of September
 30, 2024. The Company has a 15.0 million line of credit with a New York community bank, of which 9.6 million was utilized as of September 30, 2024. The Company continues to evaluate its liquidity needs and as necessary finds additional sources.

Citizens Financial Services, Inc. is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, Citizens Financial Services, Inc. is responsible for paying
 any dividends declared to its shareholders. Citizens Financial also has repurchased shares of its common stock. Citizens Financial Services, Inc. s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. Both federal and state laws
 impose restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. In particular, the Bank may not, as a state-chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System, declare a dividend without approval of the Federal Reserve, unless the
 dividend to be declared by the Bank s Board of Directors does not exceed the total of: (i) the Bank s net profits for the current year to date, plus (ii) its retained net profits for the preceding two current years, less any required transfers
 to surplus. The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings, with some exceptions. The
 Prompt Corrective Action Rules, described above, further limit the ability of banks to pay dividends, because banks which are not classified as well capitalized or adequately capitalized may not pay dividends and no dividend may be paid which
 would make the Bank undercapitalized after the dividend. At September 30, 2024, Citizens Financial Services, Inc. (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of approximately 4.2 million.

Interest Rate and Market Risk Management

The objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances
 and the market value risk of assets and liabilities.

Because of the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk and, because we have no trading portfolio, we are not subject to trading risk. At September 30, 2024,
 the Company has equity securities that represent only 0.06 of its total assets and, therefore, equity risk is not significant.

The primary components of interest-sensitive assets include adjustable-rate loans and investments, loan repayments, investment maturities and money market investments. The primary components of interest-sensitive
 liabilities include maturing certificates of deposit, IRA certificates of deposit and short-term borrowings. Savings deposits, NOW accounts and money market investor accounts are considered core deposits and are not short-term interest sensitive
 (except for the top-tier money market investor accounts, typically help by local governments, which are paid current market interest rates).

59 

Index 

Gap analysis, one of the methods used by us to analyze interest rate risk, does not necessarily show the precise impact of specific interest rate movements on our Company's net interest income because the re-pricing
 of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures. In addition, assets and liabilities within the same period may, in fact, be repaid at different times and at different rate levels. We have
 not experienced the kind of earnings volatility that might be indicated from gap analysis.

The Company currently uses a computer simulation model to better measure the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income. We use the model as part of our risk management and asset liability management
 processes that we believe will effectively identify, measure, and monitor the Company s risk exposure. In this analysis, the Company examines the results of movements in interest rates with additional assumptions made concerning prepayment
 speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage securities. Shock scenarios, which assume a parallel shift in interest rates and is instantaneous, typically have the greatest impact on net interest income. The following is a rate shock analysis and the
 impact on net interest income as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

The model makes estimates, at each level of interest rate change, regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities, call activity of other investment securities, and deposit
 selection, re-pricing and maturity structure. Because of these assumptions, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change on net interest income.
 Additionally, the changes above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change. The changes in net interest
 income noted above are in line with Company policy for interest rate risk.

Item 3

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

In the normal course of conducting business activities, the Company is exposed to market risk, principally interest rate risk, through the operations of its banking subsidiary. Interest rate risk arises from market
 driven fluctuations in interest rates that affect cash flows, income, expense and values of financial instruments and was discussed previously in this Form 10-Q. Management and a committee of the Board of Directors manage interest rate risk (see
 also Interest Rate and Market Risk Management ).

Item 4

Control and Procedures

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is
 defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the
 period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with
 the SEC (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal
 financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Exhibit 10.1 

FIRST CITIZENS COMMUNITY BANK

 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN

 (as amended and restated effective January 1, 2024)

I. 

Introduction and Objectives 

The Annual Incentive Plan (the Plan is designed to recognize and reward participants for their collective and individual contributions to the success of First Citizens Community Bank (the Bank and Citizens Financial Services, Inc. (the Company collectively referred to herein as the Employer . The Plan focuses on performance measures that are critical to the Bank s growth and profitability.

The objectives of the Plan are to:

Reward results, not effort.

Align the Employer s strategic plan, budget, and shareholder interests with participant performance.

Motivate and reward participants for achieving /exceeding performance goals.

Align incentive pay with performance.

Enable the Employer to attract and retain talent needed to drive the success of the Bank and the Company.

Encourage teamwork across the Bank and the Company.

II. 

Performance Period/Plan Year 

The performance period and the Plan operate on a calendar year basis (January 1 st - December 31 st ).

III. 

Incentive Award Opportunity 

A. The Company s Compensation/Human
 Resource Committee (the Committee ), in consultation with executive management, determines each participant s Incentive Award Opportunity under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company s named executive officers (as noted in the
 Company s annual proxy statement) do not participate in the determination of their annual Incentive Award Opportunities. As noted in Section III (B) of this Plan, Incentive Award Opportunities are shown as a percentage of base salary as such
 term is defined in Section II (C) of this Plan. Actual awards vary based on Company, Bank and Departmental/Branch performance. (See Section IV Performance Measures.) 

B. Appendix B, attached hereto, sets
 forth the Incentive Award Opportunities for the various positions at the Bank and the Company level. These incentive opportunities are reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure the awards remain competitive, based on industry standards and
 Company objectives. As noted in Section III (A) above, Incentive Award Opportunities are illustrated as a percentage of a participant s base salary (as defined in paragraph C below). 

1 

C. Exclusively for purposes of this Plan,
 base salary is defined as the compensation earned by a Participant during the Plan Year for services rendered to the Employer, excluding the following items : 

Profit sharing contributions 

Other discretionary incentive compensation (such as leadership awards and service awards)

Cash payments received for waiving Employer-paid health insurance 

Cell phone allowances 

Car allowances 

Fringe benefits 

IV. 

Performance Measures 

There are two primary categories in which performance is measured under the Plan: Corporate/Bank goals and Branch/Department goals. Goals and
 weightings will be tailored to each Participant s position, branch or department, as applicable.

The Committee takes into consideration the budget, strategic plan and other relevant items when setting specific performance measures. Weightings
 for the categories are subject to review and adjustment by the Committee on an annual basis. See Appendix C .)

A. Corporate/Bank Performance Measures : The Company/Bank goals focus on overall bank performance such as Company returns, income and other similar measures. These goals
 will reflect core measures of profitability and efficiency of Bank and Company resources. The Committee generally establishes these performance measures based on three-year averages as compared to the Company s peer group. The current peer
 group is set forth on Appendix A to this Plan and is reviewed annually. In calculating performance results, the Compensation Committee reviews public peer data compiled by the President/Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of
 the Bank. 

B. Branch/Department Performance Measures : The Branch/Department goals focus on key discipline areas of the Branch or Department and may include items such as deposit
 growth, asset quality, strategic planning and other similar projects/initiatives. Specific goals are set annually by Executive Management and the Committee . 

V. 

Determining Payouts and the Distribution of Incentive Awards 

A. At the beginning of each performance
 period, Participants will be given a performance scorecard for the Plan Year, setting forth Company/Bank performance goals and Branch or Departmental performance goals, as applicable to each Participant. At the end of the performance period,
 the President/Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company will evaluate the achievement of the Bank/Company performance goals, utilizing peer group performance when applicable, and review the results with the Committee.
 Executive Management, in consultation with Senior Management, will evaluate the achievement of the Department/Branch Performance goals and review such results with the Committee. The Chief Operating Officer will then complete a scorecard for
 each Participant and provide the scorecards to the Committee for final review. 

2 

B. Incentive Award amounts are calculated
 based on a percentage of base salary as defined in Section III (C) as of December 31 st for the applicable Plan Year. Incentive Awards are considered ordinary
 income to Participants in the year distributed and are subject to income tax and other applicable tax withholding. 

C. Incentive Awards may be paid in cash
 or Company common stock Restricted Stock ), as determined by the Committee on an annual basis. Any such Restricted Stock shall be granted under the Citizens Financial Services, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and shall be subject to the terms
 and conditions thereof. (See Appendix D for specific Award allocations.) 

D. The Committee, in its sole discretion,
 determines the payments to be made under this Plan based on the scorecards and the overall financial performance of the Bank and the Company. 

VI. 

Terms and Conditions 

A. Eligibility . Eligible employees are determined annually by the Company, in consultation with executive
 management. Eligibility in the Plan does not guarantee an Incentive Award will be paid. 

B. Effective Date . This Plan was originally effective as of January 1, 2010. The Plan was amended and
 restated in its entirety effective January 1, 2022. 

C. Program Administration . The Program is authorized by the Committee and administered by Executive
 Management. 

D. Program Changes or Discontinuance . The Bank developed the Plan based on current business, market and economic conditions; current services; and staff assignments. If changes occur that affect these
 conditions, services, assignments, or forecasts, the Bank may add to, amend, modify or discontinue any of the terms or conditions of the plan at any time. 

The Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive, change or amend the Plan as it deems appropriate and at any time.

E. Promotions and
 Transfers 

If a Participant changes his/her role or is promoted during the Plan year such that the Incentive Award opportunity changes, he/she will be eligible
 for the new position s incentive award opportunity on a pro rata basis (i.e., the award will be prorated based on the number of months employed in each respective position.)

3 

F. Termination of
 Employment 

Unless otherwise noted in this Plan, a Participant must be actively employed by the Bank or the Company on the date an Incentive Award is paid in
 order to be eligible to receive the award. In addition, if an employee has given notice of termination, any incentive award not yet paid will be forfeited. (See exceptions for death
 and retirement below.) 

G. Death, Retirement
 or a Change in Control 

Death . In the event of a
 Participant s death, the Employer will pay to the Participant s estate an Incentive Award earned for the Plan Year in which the Participant dies. Such award will be determined based on the participant s base salary earned as of his or her date
 of death. In addition, if a Participant dies prior to the distribution of an Incentive Award from a prior Plan Year, the participant s estate will receive the Award that the Participant would have received had the Participant been employed as of
 the date of distribution of the Incentive Award payout. 

Retirement . If a Participant
 retires upon the attainment of Normal Retirement Age or Early Retirement Age (as defined in the Bank s tax-qualified retirement plan), the Participant will receive an Incentive Award earned for the Plan Year in which he or she retires. Such award
 will be determined based on the participant s base salary earned as of his or her retirement date. In addition, if the Participant retires prior to the distribution of an Incentive Award from a prior Plan Year, the Participant will receive the
 award that the Participant would have received had the Participant been employed as of the date of distribution of the Incentive Award payout. 

Change in Control . In the
 event of a Change in Control (as defined herein) followed by a separation from service, Participants will receive a pro rata payout based on the period of active employment with the Employer. Performance results will be determined according to
 the results for the current year on a pro rata period basis and applied to the pro rata base salary earned. Adjustments may be made by Executive Management and/or Committee in their sole discretion. Performance results that are based on peer
 company results not yet reported will be assumed to have been 100 achieved. Incentive Awards will be distributed within ten (10) business days of the date of separation from service. 

For purposes of this Plan, the term Change in Control shall mean: a change in control of a nature that would be required to be reported in
 response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A and any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act if Company or Bank were subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements;
 provided that, without limiting the foregoing, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if the Board of Directors certifies that one of the following has occurred: (a) any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
 of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or Bank or any person who on the date hereof is a director or officer of the Company or Bank is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
 indirectly, of securities of the Company or Bank representing fifty percent (50 or more of the combined voting power of the Company s or Bank s then outstanding securities, or (b) a merger, consolidation or business combination with the Company
 and/or Bank occurs. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, in the event a Participant is determined to be a key employee as that term is defined by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code no payment shall be made until one day
 following six months from the date of separation from service as that term is defined by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

4 

VII. 

Ethics and Interpretation 

If there is any ambiguity as to the meaning of any terms or provisions of this Plan or any questions as to the correct interpretation of any
 information contained therein, the Employer s interpretation expressed by Executive Management and/or Committee will be final and binding.

The altering, inflating, and/or inappropriate manipulation of performance/financial results or any other infraction of recognized ethical business
 standards will subject the employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. In addition, any incentive compensation as provided by the Plan to which the Participant would otherwise be entitled will be revoked.

Participants who have willfully engaged in any activity injurious to the Bank or the Company will, upon termination of service, forfeit any
 incentive award earned during the award period in which the termination occurred.

VIII. 

Miscellaneous 

The Plan will not be deemed to give any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Bank or the Company, nor will the Plan interfere
 with the right of the Bank or the Company to discharge any Participant at any time.

In the absence of an authorized, written employment contract, the relationship between employees and the Bank and the Company is one of at-will
 employment. The Plan does not alter the relationship.

This Plan and the transactions and payments hereunder shall, in all respect, be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Each provision in this Plan is severable, and if any provision is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
 enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not, in any way, be affected or impaired thereby.
