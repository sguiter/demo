 The Company s money market instruments are reported at fair value based upon the daily market price for identical assets in active markets, and are therefore classified as Level 1. 
 The Company s debt securities and forward contracts are reported at fair value based on model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, and are therefore classified as Level 2. Management is responsible for estimating the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities, and in doing so, considers valuations provided by a large, third-party pricing service. For debt securities, this service maintains regular contact with market makers, brokers, dealers, and analysts to gather information on market movement, direction, trends, and other specific data. They use this information to structure yield curves for various types of debt securities and arrive at the daily valuations. The Company's forward contracts are typically traded or executed in over-the-counter markets with a high degree of pricing transparency. The market participants are generally large commercial banks. 
 Non-financial Assets that are Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
 Non-financial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, operating lease assets, goodwill, and intangible assets, are required to be measured at fair value only when an impairment loss is recognized. The Company did not record impairment charges related to non-financial assets during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 or October 1, 2023.

 Management monitors debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position to determine whether a loss exists related to the credit quality of the issuer. When developing an estimate of expected credit losses, management considers all relevant information including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of expected future cash flows. Based on this evaluation, allowance for credit losses on debt securities was recorded as of September 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Management currently intends to hold these securities to full value recovery at maturity.

 to procure inventory from various vendors. Certain of these purchase orders may be canceled by the Company, subject to cancellation penalties. These purchase commitments relate primarily to expected sales in the next twelve months. 
 A significant portion of the Company's outstanding inventory purchase orders as of September 29, 2024, as well as additional preauthorized commitments to procure strategic components based on the Company's expected customer demand, are placed with the Company's primary contract manufacturer for the Company's assembled products. The Company has the obligation to purchase any non-cancelable and non-returnable components that have been purchased by the contract manufacturer with the Company's preauthorization, when these components have not been consumed within the period defined in the terms of the Company's agreement with this contract manufacturer. While the Company typically expects such purchased components to be used in future production of Cognex finished goods, these components are considered in the Company's reserve estimate for excess and obsolete inventory. Furthermore, the Company accrues for losses on commitments for the future purchase of non-cancelable and non-returnable components from this contract manufacturer at the time that circumstances, such as changes in demand, indicate that the value of the components may not be recoverable, the loss is probable, and management has the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. 
 Various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened on behalf of or against the Company. While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that any liability arising from them will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

 Executive Overview 
 Cognex Corporation (the "Company invents and commercializes technologies that address some of the most critical manufacturing and distribution challenges. We are a leading global provider of machine vision products and solutions that seek to improve efficiency and quality in a wide range of businesses across attractive industrial end markets. In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10 of total revenue for all periods presented. 
 25 

Machine vision is used in a variety of industries where technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production, distribution, and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer or distributor can achieve better quality and efficiency by using machine vision. This results in a broad base of potential customers across a variety of industries, including automotive, logistics, consumer electronics, medical-related, semiconductor, consumer products, and food and beverage. 
 Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 234,742,000, representing an increase of 19 over the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to incremental revenue arising from the acquisition of Moritex Corporation ("Moritex") that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023, higher revenue from customers in the logistics and semiconductor industries, and the timing of certain large consumer electronics deployments that were completed late in the second quarter in 2023 compared to early in the third quarter in 2024. These increases were partially offset by continued softness across our broader factory automation business, particularly in the automotive industry. 
 Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 68 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 72 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the contribution of Moritex products with relatively lower gross margins, the amortization of Moritex acquired technologies, and the impact of competitive pricing pressures. 
 Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 14 from the third quarter of 2023. Investments in our Emerging Customer sales initiative, incremental costs related to the acquisition of Moritex, and higher incentive compensation expenses, were partially offset by the impact of disciplined cost management. Cost recoveries recorded in 2023 related to the June 2022 fire at the Company s contract manufacturer also contributed to the increase. 
 Operating income decreased to 13 of revenue for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 16 of revenue for the third quarter of 2023 driven by the lower gross margin percentage and continued investment in our "Emerging Customer" sales initiative. Net income increased to 13 of revenue, or 0.17 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 10 of revenue, or 0.11 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023 due, in part, to foreign currency losses and a higher level of discrete tax expenses in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Results of Operations 
 As foreign currency exchange rates are a factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant-currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. We also use results on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. Constant-currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Results on a constant-currency basis are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 37,501,000, or 19 , for the three-month period and increased by 43,954,000, or 7 , for the nine-month period as compared to the same periods in 2023. Revenue from the acquisition of Moritex that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023 represented approximately 10 of total revenue for the three-month period and 8 of total revenue for the nine-month period in 2024. The third quarter of 2024 included an additional month of Moritex operations to eliminate the one-month lag in consolidating Moritex financial results that had been in place since the acquisition closed. Excluding the contribution of Moritex, revenue increased by 7 for the three-month period and decreased by 2 for the nine-month period as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Revenue from customers in the logistics and semiconductor industries increased for both the three-month and nine-month periods in 2024 from the prior year. Higher revenue in the consumer electronics industry also contributed to the increase for the three-month period due to the timing of certain large deployments that were completed late in the second quarter in 2023 compared to early in the third quarter in 2024; however, revenue from customers in the consumer electronics industry decreased for the nine-month period. In addition, revenue from customers in the automotive industry decreased for both the three-month and nine-month periods in 2024 as compared to the prior year, and we continued to experience softness across our broader factory automation business during these periods.

The following table sets forth our disaggregated revenue information by geographic area based upon the customer's country of domicile (in thousands) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. 
 Three-months Ended Nine-months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change (unaudited) (unaudited) Americas 82,293 80,156 2,137 3 250,590 243,067 7,523 3 Percentage of total revenue 35 41 37 38 Europe 57,246 51,827 5,419 10 166,751 168,529 (1,778) (1) Percentage of total revenue 24 26 24 26 Greater China 45,301 34,485 10,816 31 129,760 139,837 (10,077) (7) Percentage of total revenue 19 17 19 22 Other Asia 49,902 30,773 19,129 62 137,730 89,444 48,286 54 Percentage of total revenue 21 16 20 14 Total revenue 234,742 197,241 37,501 19 684,831 640,877 43,954 7 
 Changes in revenue from a geographic perspective were as follows: 
 Revenue from customers based in the Americas increased by 3 for both the three-month and nine-month periods. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenue from customers in the logistics industry, partially offset by continued softness across our factory automation business, particularly in the automotive industry. 
 Revenue from customers based in Europe increased by 10 for the three-month period and decreased by 1 for the nine-month period. Although logistics revenue was higher for both periods in 2024, this increase was not enough to offset declines in factory automation revenue for the nine-month period. 
 Revenue from customers based in Greater China increased by 31 for the three-month period and decreased by 7 for the nine-month period. The increase for the three-month period was due primarily to higher revenue in the consumer electronics industry due to the timing of certain large deployments that were completed late in the second quarter in 2023 compared to early in the third quarter in 2024. The revenue contribution from the Moritex acquisition that benefited both periods was not enough to offset declines in factory automation revenue for the nine-month period. 
 Revenue from customers based in other countries in Asia increased by 62 for the three-month period and increased by 54 for the nine-month period. The increase was primarily driven by incremental revenue related to the acquisition of Moritex, for which the majority of revenue currently comes from customers based in Japan, as well as higher revenue from customers in the semiconductor and logistics industries. 
 Gross Margin 
 The following table sets forth our gross margin (in thousands) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. 
 Three-months Ended Nine-months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change (unaudited) (unaudited) Gross margin 159,399 142,774 16,625 12 467,935 466,197 1,738 Percentage of total revenue 68 72 68 73 
 27 

Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 68 for both the three-month and nine-month periods in 2024, respectively, as compared to 72 and 73 for the same periods in 2023. The decrease was due to a less favorable revenue mix in 2024 that included products with relatively lower gross margins from the Moritex acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the amortization of Moritex acquired technologies. The third quarter of 2024 included an additional month of Moritex operations to eliminate the one-month lag in consolidating Moritex financial results. Lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures also contributed to the lower gross margin percentage in 2024, and we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The following table sets forth our operating expenses (in thousands) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. Three-months Ended Nine-months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change (unaudited) (unaudited) Research, development, and engineering expenses 35,210 32,580 2,630 8 107,277 104,707 2,570 2 Percentage of total revenue 15 17 16 16 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 92,625 82,307 10,318 13 276,433 248,767 27,666 11 Percentage of total revenue 39 42 40 39 Loss (recovery) from fire (2,750) 2,750 (100) (5,250) 5,250 (100) Percentage of total revenue (1) (1) Total operating expenses 127,835 112,137 15,698 14 383,710 348,224 35,486 10 Percentage of total revenue 54 57 56 54 
 Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses 
 Research, development, and engineering (RD E) expenses increased by 2,630,000, or 8 , for the three-month period and increased by 2,570,000, or 2 , for the nine-month period. The increase for both periods was due primarily to higher incentive compensation expenses in 2024. Disciplined cost management helped to offset the increase in RD E expenses, including a reduction in headcount excluding the addition of Moritex engineers. The additional costs associated with a new team of optical engineers that joined Cognex with the acquisition of Moritex in the fourth quarter of 2023 were offset by lower deferred compensation costs related to the 2019 acquisition of Sualab Co, Ltd. that were fully paid in October 2023. The third quarter of 2024 included an additional month of Moritex operations to eliminate the one-month lag in consolidating Moritex financial results. 
 RD E expenses as a percentage of revenue were 15 and 16 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2024, respectively, as compared to 17 and 16 for the same periods in 2023. We believe that a continued commitment to RD E activities is essential to maintain or achieve product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, as well as to provide engineering support for large customers. In addition, we consider our ability to accelerate the time to market for new products to be critical to our revenue growth and competitive position. These percentages are impacted by revenue levels and investment cycles. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative (SG A) expenses increased by 10,318,000, or 13 , for the three-month period and increased by 27,666,000, or 11 , for the nine-month period as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional sales and marketing resources dedicated to our Emerging Customer sales initiative that was launched in 2023 with the goal to serve a broader customer base and deepen penetration of less served markets. Costs related to the acquisition of Moritex that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023 also contributed to the higher SG A expenses, including additional sales and support personnel-related costs, the amortization of acquired customer relationships and trademarks, and integration costs. The third quarter of 2024 included an additional month of Moritex operations to eliminate the one-month lag in consolidating Moritex financial results. In addition, incentive compensation expenses were higher in 2024. Disciplined cost management helped to offset the increase in SG A expenses, including the realignment of headcount to support the "Emerging Customer" sales initiative. 
 Loss (Recovery) from Fire 
 On June 7, 2022, the Company s primary contract manufacturer experienced a fire at its plant in Indonesia, 
 28 

destroying a significant amount of Cognex inventories. During the nine-month period in 2023, the Company recorded recoveries related to the fire including 2,750,000 for proceeds received from a financial settlement in the third quarter of 2023 and 2,500,000 for proceeds received from business interruption insurance in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Non-operating Income (Expense) 
 The following table sets forth our non-operating income (expense) (in thousands) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. 
 Three-months Ended Nine-months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change (unaudited) (unaudited) Foreign currency gain (loss) 1,221 (8,699) 9,920 (114) 1,086 (9,910) 10,996 (111) Investment income 3,561 4,891 (1,330) (27) 9,797 12,573 (2,776) (22) Other income (expense) 209 173 36 21 581 358 223 62 Total non-operating income (expense) 4,991 (3,635) 8,626 (237) 11,464 3,021 8,443 279 
 The Company recorded foreign currency gains of 1,221,000 and 1,086,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2024, respectively, and foreign currency losses of 8,699,000 and 9,910,000 for the corresponding periods in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of 8,456,000 on the settlement of a foreign currency forward contract entered into to the hedge the purchase price for Moritex, which was paid in Japanese Yen. Remaining foreign currency gains and losses in each period resulted primarily from the revaluation and settlement of assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company, which is the U.S. Dollar, or its subsidiaries. 
 Investment income decreased by 1,330,000, or 27 , for the three-month period and decreased by 2,776,000, or 22 , for the nine-month period in 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower average investment balances, partially offset by higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities. During the fourth quarter of 2023, net cash payments related to the acquisition of Moritex reduced cash available to invest by approximately 257 million, which resulted in lower investment income for 2024. 
 The Company recorded other income of 209,000 and 581,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods in 2024, respectively, and 173,000 and 358,000 for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The following table sets forth income tax information (in thousands) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023.

Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, the Company s effective tax rate was 15 for both nine-month periods in 2024 and 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of 607,165,000 as of September 29, 2024. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments to maintain the liquidity and safety of the investment portfolio. 
 As of September 29, 2024, the Company's portfolio of debt securities was in a net unrealized gain position of 164,000. Although the Company typically holds investments in an unrealized loss position until full value recovery at maturity, if the Company is required to sell debt securities to meet liquidity needs, it may sell these investments at a loss. 
 
 Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 97,677,000 for the nine-month period in 2024. Significant uses of cash consisted of an increase in accounts receivable to support sales initiatives. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities totaled 41,194,000 for the nine-month period in 2024. Investing activities included capital expenditures that totaled 12,970,000 and consisted primarily of continued investments in business systems, manufacturing equipment related to new product introductions and building improvements. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled 62,665,000 for the nine-month period in 2024. 
 In March 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 500,000,000 of the Company's common stock. Under this March 2022 program, the Company repurchased 555,000 shares at a total cost of 23,841,000 during the nine-month period in 2024, leaving a remaining balance of 309,051,000 as of September 29, 2024. The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock awards, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements. The Company is authorized to make repurchases of its common stock through open market purchases, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, or in privately negotiated transactions. 
 The Company s Board of Directors declared and paid cash dividends of 0.075 per share for the first, second and third quarters of 2024, totaling 38,619,000. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on such factors as the Board deems relevant, including, among other things, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flow from operations. 
 Future Cash Requirements 
 The Company's future material cash requirements include contractual obligations related to inventory purchase commitments and leases. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had inventory purchase commitments of 38,153,000, with the majority payable in the next twelve months, and lease payment obligations of 116,702,000, with 13,558,000 payable in the next twelve months. 
 Other significant and/or expected cash outlays for 2024 are as follows: 
 We expect to continue to make significant cash outlays related to our "Emerging Customer" sales initiative as we continue to grow our sales force to serve a broader customer base and deepen penetration of less served markets. 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 subjected unrepatriated foreign earnings to a one-time transition tax. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had a remaining balance payable of 18,338,000 through 2025. 
 We believe that the Company's existing cash and investment balances, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities for the next twelve months. In addition, the Company has no long-term debt. We believe that our balance sheet condition currently gives us a strong position with respect to anticipated longer-term liquidity needs.

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s exposures to market risk since December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, except as described below relating to the acquisition of Moritex Corporation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 
 The Company closed the acquisition of Moritex Corporation on October 18, 2023. The new acquisition's total assets and revenues constituted approximately 5 and 8 , respectively, of the Company s consolidated total assets and revenues as shown on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024. As the acquisition occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company excluded Moritex Corporation from the scope of the assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and, with respect to the portion of disclosure controls and procedures that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting of Moritex Corporation, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently-acquired business may be omitted from the scope for the one-year period following the acquisition if specified conditions are satisfied. 
 Except as described above, there have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company s systems evolve with its business.
