Specifically, the warrant agreement allows for the exercise of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants to be settled in cash upon a tender offer where the maker of the offer owns beneficially more than 50 of the Class A shares following the tender offer. This provision precludes the warrants from being classified as shareholders equity (deficit) as not all of the Company s shareholders need to participate in such a tender offer to trigger the potential cash settlement. As the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants also meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, upon completion of the IPO, the Company recorded these warrants as liabilities on its condensed balance sheets, with subsequent changes in their respective fair values recognized in the condensed statements of operations at each reporting date. In accordance with ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments , the Company has concluded that a portion of the transaction costs, which is directly related to the IPO and Private Placement, would be allocated to the warrants based on their relative fair value against total proceeds, and recognized as transaction costs in the condensed statements of operations.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 5,816,203, which consisted of interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 4,494,841, change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,116,750, gain from extinguishment of deferred underwriting commissions allocated to warrant liabilities of 778,818 and partially offset by a gain from general and administrative expenses of 574,206 which includes a gain for forgiveness of previously recorded liabilities of 695,909. Liquidity and Capital Resources On February 4, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 103,500,000 Units which includes full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 13,500,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 1,035,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 11,350,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 2.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 22,700,000.

Table of Contents 
 Following our IPO, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of 1,035,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 57,010,008 in costs related to our IPO, including 19,800,000 of underwriting fees, net of 900,000 reimbursed from the underwriters, 36,225,000 of deferred underwriting fees and 995,008 of other costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 443,431. Net income of 110,495 was affected by change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 744,500 and interest earned on cash held in Trust Account of 471,143. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 661,717 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 906,192. Net income of 5,816,203 was affected by change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,116,750, relating to the gain from extinguishment of deferred underwriting commissions allocated to derivative warrant liability of 778,818 and interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 4,494,841. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 331,986 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 16,012,716. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company withdrew 7,662,572 from Trust Account in connection with the redemption. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 34,688. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 2.00 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 500,000 and 500,000 outstanding under the Working Capital Loans. On August 8, 2023, the Company issued a promissory note (the Note to the Sponsor. The Note provides up to 500,000 for withdrawal and does not incur interest. The Note is due upon the earlier of the closing of a Business Combination or wind up. The Company borrowed the full 500,000 on August 8, 2023 and no further borrowings are available under this Note as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were amounts of 500,000 and 500,000 outstanding under the Note, respectively. On March 13, 2024, the Company issued another promissory note to the Sponsor (the 2024 Note , and together with the Note, the Notes ). The 2024 Note provides up to 500,000 for withdrawal and does not incur interest. The Company borrowed 125,000 on March 14, 2024 and an additional 235,000 on March 28, 2024. The 2024 Note is due upon the earlier of the closing of a business combination or wind up. On April 15, 2024, the Sponsor assigned the 2024 Note, and all of its right, title, interest in and obligation under the 2024 Note, to Starwood Capital Group Management, LLC. The Company borrowed an additional 140,000 on July 22, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were amounts of 500,000 and 0 outstanding under the 2024 Note, respectively. Going Concern If the Business Combination is not consummated, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans on additional investments from the Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead 

 23

 expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through one year from the date of these financial statements if a Business Combination is not consummated. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40 Going Concern, the Company has until December 4, 2024 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after December 4, 2024. Management intends to complete a Business Combination prior to the mandatory liquidation date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of one of our executive officers a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We began incurring these fees on February 1, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 36,225,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On February 14, 2023 and February 16, 2023, the Company was notified by BofA Securities, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, respectively, waiving their rights to their portion of the deferred underwriting fee. The Company reduced the deferred underwriting fee payable on the balance sheet by 21,735,000, as a result 467,291 is reflected on the Company s statement of operations for the amounts allocated in connection with the Company s warrants at the IPO and 21,267,709 was charged to accumulated deficit for the portion allocated to Class A ordinary shares at the IPO. On August 14, 2023, the Company was notified by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, they were waiving their rights to their portion of the deferred underwriting fee. The Company reduced the deferred underwriting fee payable on the balance sheet by 14,490,000, as a result 311,527 is reflected on the Company s statement of operations for the amounts allocated in connection with the Company s warrants at the IPO and 14,178,473 was charged to accumulated deficit for the portion allocated to Class A ordinary shares at the IPO. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company has not identified any critical accounting estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

 24 

Table of Contents 
 Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our ordinary shares subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity (deficit). Our ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of our balance sheets. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of the redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Net Income per Ordinary Share Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. This presentation contemplates a Business Combination as the most likely outcome, in which case, both classes of shares share pro rata in the income of the Company. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A ordinary shares is excluded from the earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Derivative Warrant Liabilities We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued Class A ordinary share purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. We issued 25,875,000 public warrants to investors in our IPO and issued 11,350,000 Private Placement Warrants. All of our outstanding warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statements of operations. The Company s Public Warrants are values based on quotes market prices and are considered a Level 1 liability. The Company s Private Placement Warrants are classified as a Level 2 liability due to the similarities to the Company s Public Warrants and are valued using the quote market prices of the Public Warrants. Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our IPO, the net proceeds of our IPO, including amounts in the Trust Account, have been invested in certain U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Form 10-K, except for the below risk factors. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. NYSE American delisted the Company s securities from its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in its securities and subject the Company to additional trading restrictions. On February 5, 2024, the Company received a written notice from NYSE American indicating that the staff of NYSE American has determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company s Securities. NYSE American reached its decision to delist the Company s Securities pursuant to Sections 119(b) and 119(f) of the NYSE American Company Guide because the Company failed to consummate a business combination (i) within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement or (ii) such shorter period that the Company specified in its registration statement. The Company has a right to a review of NYSE American s staff s determination to delist the Securities by the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Committee for Review of the Board of Directors of NYSE American (the Panel ). The Company timely requested the hearing before the Panel to request sufficient time to complete a business combination. On October 23, 2024, the Panel convened to consider written submissions made by the Company and the Staff. On November 1, 2024, the Panel issued written notice of its decision stating that the Panel upholds the Staff s determination to initiate delisting proceedings. While the Company could have requested that the full Committee for Review of NYSE American (the Committee for Review reconsider the decision of the Panel, the Company did not have the full Committee for Review reconsider the decision of the Panel. NYSE American announced on November 1, 2024 that the Staff has determined to suspend trading of the Securities. NYSE American completed the delisting by filing a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, on Form 25 with the SEC on November 1, 2024. The Company currently has its Securities quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market. The Company remains subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Since our securities trade on the OTC Pink Open Market, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: the price of our securities will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with NYSE American; a requirement to trade on the OTC Pink Open Market for a year before reapplying for listing on a national securities exchange; holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so; we may become subject to shareholder litigation; we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our securities; we may lose media and analyst coverage; and 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 we would likely lose any active trading market for our securities, as our securities may then only be traded on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all. 
 Additionally, if our securities are delisted from trading on the OTC Pink Open Market our investors ability to make transactions in our securities could be limited and subject us to additional trading restrictions. Because our securities were delisted from NYSE American and are no longer listed on a national securities exchange, we may face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our securities are penny stocks which will require brokers trading in our Public Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (v) a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with an initial business combination. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because our Securities were delisted from NYSE American and trade on the OTC Pink Open Market, our Class A Ordinary Shares, Warrants and Units do not qualify as covered securities under the Securities Act and we are subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Public shareholders who do not elect to redeem their Public Shares in connection with the Shareholder Meeting, or the shareholder meeting to approve the Business Combination, may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our shares on the open market or upon our liquidation or redemption of shares. The price of our shares may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that shareholders will be able to dispose of our shares at favorable prices, or at all. The SEC has recently issued final rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that the Company or others may determine to undertake in connection with such rules may increase our costs and the time needed to complete the Business Combination. On January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the 2024 SPAC Rules ), which became effective on July 1, 2024, that formally adopted some of the SEC s proposed rules for SPACs that were released on March 30, 2022. The 2024 SPAC Rules, among other items, impose additional disclosure requirements in initial public offerings by SPACs and business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amend the financial statement requirements applicable to business combination transactions involving such companies; update and expand guidance regarding the general use of projections in SEC filings, including requiring disclosure of all material bases of the projections and all material assumptions underlying the projections; increase the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and could impact the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete, and the costs associated with, our initial business combination, and results of operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial Business Combination and instead liquidate the Company. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including: restrictions on the nature of our investments; and restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. 
 In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: registration as an investment company with the SEC; adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to. 

28 

Table of Contents 
 In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading investment securities constituting more than 40 of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business is to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not spend a considerable amount of time actively managing the assets in the Trust Account for the primary purpose of achieving investment returns. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. We do not believe that our activities subject us to the Investment Company Act. Initially, the funds in the Trust Account had, since our initial public offering been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. However, to mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we liquidated the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and instructed the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to maintain the funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. Therefore, by restricting the investments of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering that are held in our Trust Account, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Our securities are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with the implementation by the directors of, following a shareholder vote, an amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our Public Shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our Public Shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination by the Termination Date or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination by the Termination Date, our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to holders of our Public Shares as part of our redemption of the Public Shares. In the adopting release for the 2024 SPAC Rules, the SEC provided guidance that a SPAC s potential status as an investment company depends on a variety of factors, such as a SPAC s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities and is a question of facts and circumstances requiring individualized analysis. If we were deemed to be subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. Unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would either register as an investment company or wind down and abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate and dissolve in accordance with our Memorandum and Articles of Association. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures None. Item 5. Other Information .
