a.
Contractual agreements with VIEs 

Power
of Attorney 

Pursuant
to the power of attorney agreements among the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises WFOEs ), the VIEs and their respective nominee
shareholders, each nominee shareholder of the VIEs irrevocably undertakes to appoint the WFOE, as the attorney-in-fact to exercise all
of the rights as a shareholder of the VIEs, including, but not limited to, the right to convene and attend shareholders meeting,
vote on any resolution that requires a shareholder vote, such as appoint or remove directors and other senior management, and other voting
rights pursuant to the articles of association (subject to the amendments) of the VIEs. Each power of attorney agreement is irrevocable
and remains in effect as long as the nominee shareholders continues to be a shareholder of the VIEs. Unless otherwise required by PRC
Laws, none of the VIEs or its shareholders can unilaterally terminate this agreement. 

Exclusive
Option Agreements 

Pursuant
to the exclusive option agreements among WFOEs, the VIEs and their respective nominee shareholders, the nominee shareholders granted
WFOEs exclusive right to purchase, when and to the extent permitted under PRC law, all or part of the equity interests from shareholders
of VIEs. The exercise price for the options to purchase all or part of the equity interests shall be the minimum amount of consideration
permissible under then applicable PRC law. The agreement shall be valid until WFOEs or its designated party purchases all the shares
from shareholders of VIEs. The terms of the exclusive option agreement are 10 years and can be automatically extended until such time
WFOEs delivers a confirmation letter specifying the renewal term of this agreement. Unless otherwise required by PRC Laws, the VIEs or
its shareholders shall not unilaterally terminate this agreement. 

Exclusive
Business Corporation Agreement 

Pursuant
to the exclusive business cooperation agreements among the WFOEs and the VIEs, respectively, the WFOEs have the exclusive right to provide
the VIEs with services related to, among other things, comprehensive technical support, professional training, consulting services, trademark
and copyright of system,. Without prior written consent of the WFOEs, the VIEs agree not to directly or indirectly accept the same or
any similar services provided by any others regarding the matters ascribed by the exclusive business cooperation agreements. The VIEs
agree to pay the WFOEs services fees, which shall be determined by the WFOEs. The WFOEs have the exclusive ownership of intellectual
property rights created as a result of the performance of the agreements. The agreements shall remain effective except that the WFOEs
are entitled to terminate the agreements in writing. Unless otherwise required by PRC Laws, the VIEs shall not unilaterally terminate
this agreement. 

Equity
Pledge Agreement 

Pursuant
to the equity pledge agreements among the WFOEs, the VIEs and their respective nominee shareholders, the nominee shareholders of the
VIEs pledged all of their respective equity interests in the VIEs to the WFOEs as collaterals for performance of the obligations of the
VIEs and their nominee shareholders under the exclusive business cooperation agreements, the power of attorney agreements, and the exclusive
option agreements. The nominee shareholders of the VIEs also undertake that, during the term of the equity pledge agreements, unless
otherwise approved by the WFOEs in writing, they will not transfer the pledged equity interests or create or allow any new pledge or
other encumbrance on the pledged equity interests. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until VIEs and their respective nominee
shareholders discharge all their obligations under the contractual agreements. 

Spousal
Consent Letter 

Pursuant
to the spousal consent letters, the spouses of some of the individual nominee shareholders of the VIEs unconditionally and irrevocably
agree that the equity interest in the VIEs held by and registered in the name of his or her respective spouse will be disposed of pursuant
to the relevant exclusive business cooperation agreements, equity pledge agreements, the exclusive option agreements and the power of
attorney agreements, without his or her consent. In addition, each of them agrees not to assert any rights over the equity interest in
the VIEs held by their respective spouses. In addition, in the event that any of them obtains any equity interest in the VIEs held by
their respective spouses for any reason, such spouses agree to be bound by similar obligations and agreed to enter into similar contractual
arrangements. 

b.
Risks in relation to the VIE structure 

On
March 15, 2019, the National People s Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which became effective on January
1, 2020, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify
contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, but it contains a catch-all provision under the definition of foreign
investment , which includes investments made by foreign investors through means stipulated in laws or administrative regulations
or other methods prescribed by the State Council. It is unclear whether the Group s corporate structure will be seen as violating
the foreign investment rules as the Group is currently leveraging the contractual arrangements to operate certain business in which foreign
investors are prohibited from or restricted to investing. If variable interest entities fall within the definition of foreign investment
entities, the Group s ability to use the contractual arrangements with its VIEs and the Group s ability to conduct business
through the VIEs could be severely limited. 

If
the PRC government otherwise finds that the Group in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or lacks the necessary
permits or licenses to operate the business, the Group s relevant PRC regulatory authorities could: 

revoke the business licenses and/or operating licenses of the Group s PRC entities; 

impose fines; 

confiscate any income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations, or impose other requirements with which the Group may
not be able to comply; 

discontinue or place restrictions or onerous conditions on the Group s operations; 

place restrictions on the right to collect revenues; 

require the Group to restructure ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual agreements with the VIEs and
deregistering the equity pledges of the VIEs, which in turn would affect the ability to consolidate the financial results of and derive
economic interests from the VIEs and their subsidiaries; 

restrict or prohibit the use of the proceeds from financing activities to finance the business and operations of the VIEs and their subsidiaries;
or 

take other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to the Group s business. 

The
imposition of any of these penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on the Group s ability to conduct the Group s
business. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties causes the Group to lose the rights to direct the activities of the
VIEs or the right to receive its economic benefits, the Group would no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs. The management believes
that the likelihood for the Group to lose such ability is remote based on current facts and circumstances. However, the interpretation
and implementation of the laws and regulations in the PRC and their application to an effect on the legality, binding effect and enforceability
of contracts are subject to the discretion of competent PRC authorities, and therefore there is no assurance that relevant PRC authorities
will take the same position as the Group herein in respect of the legality, binding effect and enforceability of each of the contractual
arrangements. Meanwhile, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, it may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and
policies or in the interpretation and application of existing laws, regulations and policies, which may limit legal protections available
to the Group to enforce the contractual arrangements should the VIEs or the nominee shareholders of the VIEs fail to perform their obligations
under those arrangements. The enforceability, and therefore the benefits, of the contractual agreements between the Company and the VIEs
depend on nominee shareholders enforcing the contracts. There is a risk that nominee shareholders of VIEs, who in some cases are also
shareholders of the Company may have conflict of interests with the Company in the future or fail to perform their contractual obligations.
Given the significance and importance of the VIEs, there would be a significant negative impact to the Company if these contracts were
not enforced. 

The
Group s operations depend on the VIEs to honor their contractual agreements with the Group. The Company s ability to direct
activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and the Company s right to receive the economic
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs depend on the authorization by the shareholders of the VIEs to exercise voting
rights on all matters requiring shareholder approval in the VIEs. The Company believes that the agreements on authorization to exercise
shareholder s voting power are enforceable against each party thereto in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws or
regulations currently in effect and the possibility that it will no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs as a result of the aforementioned
risks and uncertainties is remote.

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon long-term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director
(Guowei Zhang) to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation
as a going concern is dependent on long term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director (Guowei Zhang) to
meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until sufficient
sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described
above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset/liability method prescribed by ASC 740 Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets have
not been recognized in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
the Company can utilize the benefits. 

Management
believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable in the future. Accordingly, the Company
provided for a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

assumptions and judgments made as part of the adoption of this new lease standard include determining (i) whether a contract contains
a lease, (ii) whether a contract involves an identified asset, and (iii) which party to the contract directs the use of the asset. The

to the Company over terms similar to the lease terms.

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon long-term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director
(Guowei Zhang) to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation
as a going concern is dependent on long term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director (Guowei Zhang) to
meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until sufficient
sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described
above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the
Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Contractual
Obligations 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments.
We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important
at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied
and disclosed in our condensed financial statements. 

While
we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 

29 

Impact
of Inflation 

In
accordance with the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the year-over-year percentage changes in the consumer price index for March
 2021,2022, and 2023 were 4.4 ,2 , and 0.2 respectively. Inflation in China has not materially affected our profitability
and operating results. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be unaffected by higher inflation rates in China in the future. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rates 

We
are not materially affected by foreign currency exchange rates. However, it is difficult to predict how market forces, or PRC or U.S.
government policy, might affect our operations. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial
liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant change in the value of the RMB against the
U.S. dollar. Limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. So far, we have
not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we potentially
may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be
limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. Furthermore, our currency exchange losses may be magnified
by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a- 15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design
of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on their
evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed
in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
as a result of continuing weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

As
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024, as filed on July 5, 2024 and amended on August 15,
2024, based on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, management concluded
that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of August 31, 2024, due to: 1) lack of a functioning audit
committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s board of director; (2) inadequate segregation of duties
consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect
to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial
disclosure and reporting processes. Management believes the above weakness constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting. Until such time, if ever, that we remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
we expect that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures will continue. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) or 15d- 15(f)) during the period covered
by this report, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
