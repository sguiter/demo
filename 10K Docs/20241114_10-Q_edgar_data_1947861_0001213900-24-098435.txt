CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and
financial trends impacting the financial condition of our business. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future
performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will
be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management s
good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance
or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements include all statements
that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, 
 should, could, would, expect, intend, seek, plan, 
 anticipate, believe, estimate, project, predict, potential, 
 might, forecast, continue, or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions and comparable
terminology intended to reference future periods. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

Our ability to effectively operate our business segments; 

Our ability to manage our research, development, expansion, growth and operating expenses; 

Our ability to evaluate and measure our business, prospects and performance metrics; 

Our ability to compete, directly and indirectly, and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry; 

Our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and customer behavior; and 

Our ability to protect our intellectual property and to develop, maintain and enhance a strong brand. 

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed,
estimated, expected, intended or planned. 

Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements. Accordingly, the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should
not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions described in such statements will occur or that our objectives and plans
will be achieved, and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements.

with an original issue discount of . 

On
November 7, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with D. Boral Capital LLC as the underwriter, relating to a firm
commitment underwritten public offering of (i) units (the Units at a public offering price of per Unit,
with each Unit consisting of share of common stock, par value per share, of the Company Common Stock ), 
Series A warrant to purchase share of Common Stock at an exercise price of per share and Series B warrant to purchase
such number of shares of Common Stock as determined on the Reset Date as defined thereunder, at an exercise price of per shares,
and (ii) pre-funded units (the Pre-Funded Units at a public offering price of per Pre-Funded Unit, with
each Pre-Funded Unit consisting of pre-funded warrant (the Pre-Funded Warrants exercisable for share of Common
Stock at an exercise price of per share, one Series A Warrant and one Series B Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants will be immediately
exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. 

The
Company has experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities since 2022. In addition, the
Company had, and may potentially continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund its expansion
plan and related operations. Successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues
adequate to support the Company s cost structure. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

If
the Company is unable to realize its assets within the normal operating cycle of a twelve (12) month period, the Company may have
to consider supplementing its available sources of funds through the following sources: 

financial
 support from the Company s related parties and stockholders; 

other available sources
 of financing from banks and other financial institutions; 

equity financing through
 capital market. 

The
Company can make no assurances that required financings will be available for the amounts needed, or on terms commercially acceptable
to the Company, if at all. If one or all of these events does not occur or subsequent capital raises are insufficient to bridge financial
and liquidity shortfall, there would likely be a material adverse effect on the Company and would materially adversely affect its ability
to continue as a going concern. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and,
accordingly, do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Many states focused on farming are limited to grow crops are certain months such as Spring to Fall only, and or are too far from production
states too have fresh produce year-round. There are cost advantages also as vertical farming systems produces a much higher yield per
acre of land. In most cases, water consumption is much lower, up to 90 . Many indoor growers can locate closer to large population centers
which can significantly reduce cost of trucking, and lead time whilst reducing carbon emissions as well. 

In February 2024 the Company started shipping
a new product line of grow containers. These systems are indoor vertical farming units inside a traditional shipping container but equipped
with temperature controls, multiple layers of growing space, L.E.D. lights, water controls and other systems. The Company has branded

These are value add components that will help growers increase yield, but more importantly reduce failures and dramatically improve growing
environments such. The new products are a natural complement to its our base of LED grow lights.

to work with our suppliers in improving lighting products to be both of the highest quality and simultaneously cost effective for the
customer. The Company invests in trips abroad to source and partner with manufacturing companies. We expect to develop additional manufacturing
relationships and suppliers in Europe in the near future. 

The Company is also developing proprietary all
in one automated and robotic indoor growing systems that are under design and testing phases. 

The Company utilizes its vast network in the industry
and recent publicity in listing on Nasdaq in acquiring leads for potential partnerships in sourcing, research and development of new product
and business acquisitions. 

Regulatory Environment 

The importation of LED lighting and distribution
of such equipment in the United States and Canada does not require strict government disclosures and technical inspections. The Company
obtains local business permits to store in our main warehouses, obtain licenses to resell, and follows guidelines on packaging. Certain
utility companies in the U.S. have programs that award rebates to heavy usage customers, some of which are in the indoor farming business.
These customers are required to install LED lights with a minimum 50,000 hours life. There is also a performance requirement set by DesignLights
Consortium, a non-profit energy improvement agency. 

36 

Sourcing 

The Company has long-term relationships with suppliers
in Asia. Our top three suppliers of LED equipment are American Agricultural Innovation Technology Inc., Solislike-Tech Co., Ltd., Dongguan
ZSC Lighting Co., Ltd. Each supplier provides us net 30 to net 90 day terms. The Company has also been approached by established lighting
companies based in Japan and Germany. On grow feed, fertilizers and nutrients, our potential suppliers are based in Europe and some in
Asia. Our grow container product was jointly developed and manufactured by a company based in Shenzhen, China. 

On April 24, 2023, we entered into a strategic
cooperation agreement with Sinoinnovo Technology (Guangdong) Co., Ltd. Sinoinnovo ), a company incorporated under the laws
of China, pursuant to which Nature s Mircle will source from Sinoinnovo its grow light systems for distribution in the U.S. and
Europe. Both companies will also cooperate jointly to set up advanced manufacturing capabilities in China and the U.S.

Revenue 

Revenue for the three months ended September 30,
2024 increased 13.5 to 3,052,727 as compared to 2,690,690 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue increased due to rising
customer demand from existing customers and also new customers achieved via additional hiring of five sales-workers in first half of 2024
and the availability of new product lines that are new to 2024. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we had 59 and 73 customers, respectively. Average revenue per customer for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
were approximately 51,741 and 36,859, respectively. Our revenue from top 5 customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was
approximately 2.3 million compared to approximately 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing
an increase of 45.0 . The higher average sale and increased revenue from top 5 customer are reflective of higher industry demand. 

In addition, our staff have been in constant communication
with customers on their lighting and indoor farming needs and monitor their plans to replenish old equipment and related components as
well us in building new facilities. We also hired a new director of sales in January 2024 plus in March of 2024 hired a new sales representative
in northern California and another hired on the east coast. 

Also, our principal business is in CEA industry
which rapidly expanding due to growing consumer demand for low-environmental-impact food, local food systems, and improved accessibility
to high-quality produce with shorter supply chains. In addition, our access to capital market will allow us to expend significant resources
to compete, increase our product supply and develop new products and new market. Starting in 2023, the Company has two customers supplying
LED lighting to growers that apply to rebate programs with utility companies. Utility companies are incentivizing volume users of electricity
to convert to LED lighting by providing rebates. The rebate process can take time to verify and document by Utility companies resulting
in payments of 60 to 120 days. The Company believes the credit quality of rebate payers more than offset the risk of long collection turnover
of receivables. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has sold via these programs with total sales to two
customers of approximately 0.5 million and nil, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Sources of Liquidity 

In assessing liquidity, we monitor and analyze
cash on-hand and operating expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet working capital requirements and operating expense
obligations. To date, we financed our operations primarily through debt financing from financial institution and related parties. As of
September 30, 2024, we had approximately 40,114 in cash which primarily consists of bank deposits, which are unrestricted as to withdrawal
and use. Our working capital deficit was approximately 11.7 million as of September 30, 2024. 

On October 14, 2024, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement with a certain investor pursuant to which we sold to the investor a convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal
amount of 101,200 with an original issue discount of 13,200. 

On November 7, 2024, we entered into an underwriting
agreement with D. Boral Capital LLC as the underwriter, relating to a firm commitment underwritten public offering of (i) 25,133,631 units
(the Units at a public offering price of 0.1118 per Unit, with each Unit consisting of one share of common stock, par
value 0.0001 per share, of us Common Stock ), one Series A warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise
price of 0.1118 per share and one Series B warrant to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock as determined on the Reset Date
as defined thereunder, at an exercise price of 0.0001 per shares, and (ii) 1,700,000 pre-funded units (the Pre-Funded Units at a public offering price of 0.1117 per Pre-Funded Unit, with each Pre-Funded Unit consisting of one pre-funded warrant (the Pre-Funded
Warrants exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.0001 per share, one Series A Warrant and one Series
B Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants will be immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants
are exercised in full. 

We have experienced recurring losses from operations
and negative cash flows from operating activities since 2022. In addition, given our ongoing capital needs, our financial position is
under pressure, and may potentially continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our expansion
plan and related operations. Successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues
adequate to support our cost structure. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements are issued. If we are unable to realize our assets within the normal operating cycle of a twelve (12) month period, we
may have to consider supplementing our available sources of funds through the following sources: 

financial support from our related parties and shareholders; 

other available sources of financing from banks and other financial institutions; 

equity financing through capital market 

41 

We can make no assurances that required financings
will be available for the amounts needed, or on terms commercially acceptable to us, if at all. If one or all of these events does not
occur or subsequent capital raises are insufficient to bridge financial and liquidity shortfall, there would likely be a material adverse
effect on us and would materially adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

approximately 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The main reason for the increase in net cash provided was primarily
a result of net proceeds from short-term loan from third parties of 3.0 million, shares and warrants issued through July public
offering of approximately 1.0 million, and convertible notes borrowing of approximately 0.8 million, offset by payments of deferred
offering costs of approximately 0.3 million, repayments on long term loans which are mainly our car and mortgage loan of approximately
 0.2 million, repayments on short-term loan from third parties of approximately 1.1 million, repayments on convertible notes of
approximately 0.2 million. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The main reason for the increase in net cash provided was primarily
a result of net proceeds from long-term loan borrowing from third parties of 3.3 million, and short-term loan borrowing from related
parties of 0.8 million, offset by payments of deferred offering costs of 0.6 million, repayments on long term loans which are mainly
our car and mortgage loan of 0.1 million, repayments on short-term loan from third parties of 1.8 million, and repayments on short-term
loan from related parties of approximately 0.7 million.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
(as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect
on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

We prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP and pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission SEC ). The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In some cases, changes
in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially
from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition
and results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting
policies, which we discuss further below. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant
judgments and estimates in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue recognition 

We follow Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606
Revenue Recognition and recognizes revenue from product sales revenues, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, when the following
revenue recognition criteria are met: a contract has been identified, separate performance obligations are identified, the transaction
price is determined, the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations and revenue is recognized upon satisfying
each performance obligation. 

We are a growing agriculture technology company
providing CEA hardware products to growers in the controlled environment agriculture industry setting in North America. Majority
of our products were grow lights and related products for the indoor growing settings. Starting from first quarter of 2024, we also provide
indoor grow containers to our customers. 

Our contracts with customers where the amounts
charged per product is fixed and determinable, the specific terms of the contracts were agreed on by us including payment terms which
are typically 30 to 60 days for existing customers and prepaid for most new customers. In certain contracts involving customers that
entered into rebate programs with utility companies for using LED lighting, payment term ranges from 60 to 120 days. 

In determining the transaction price, we adjust
consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing.
We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period
between payment by the customers and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. The risk
of loss or damage upon shipment, therefore, revenue from product sales is recognized at a point in time when control of product transfer
to customer and we have no further obligation to provide services related to such product. Return allowances which are immaterial based
on historical experience. 

We evaluate the criteria of ASC 606 Revenue
Recognition Principal-Agent Considerations in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related
costs, or the net amount earned as commissions. 

We ship the products according to shipping terms
on the purchase order or sales order. Once delivery is complete, we then send an invoice to the customer according to the quantity and
price of shipment. 

43 

We evaluate the indicators of control in accordance
with ASU 2016-08: 1) We are the most visible entity to customers and assumes fulfilment risk and risks related to the acceptability of
products, including addressing customer inquiries directly and handling of product returns or refunds directly if any. For grow light
products, we have our own brand for marketing. For indoor grow containers products, we are also involved in the design and technical specification
of the products to meet requirement in the US market. 2) We assume inventory risk either through storing the products in our own warehouses;
or for drop shipments directly from vendors, we take the title from vendors through inspection and acceptance and are responsible for
product damage during shipment period prior to acceptance of our customers and are also responsible for product return if the customer
is not satisfied with the products. 3) We determine the resale price of the products. 4) We are the party that direct the use of the inventory
and can prevent the vendor from transferring the product to a customer or to redirect the products to a different customer, after evaluating
the above scenario, we consider ourselves the principal of these arrangements and records revenue on a gross basis. 

Payments received prior to the delivery of goods
to customers or picked up by the customers are recorded as contract liabilities. 

We periodically provide incentive offers to our
customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and
other similar offers. 

Current discount offers, when accepted by our
customers, are treated as a reduction to the transaction price of the related transaction. 

Sales discounts are recorded in the period in
which the related sale is recognized. Sales return allowances are recorded upon recognizing the related sales. 

Inventory 

Inventory consists of finished goods ready for
sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. We value our inventory using the weighted average costing method. We include a part
of cost of goods sold any freight incurred to ship the product from our vendors to warehouses. Outbound freight costs related to shipping
costs to customers are considered period costs and reflected in cost of revenue. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts
of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. 

If the estimated realizable value of the inventory
is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce our carrying value to our estimated market value. We also review inventory for
slow moving and obsolescence and records allowance for obsolescence. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which
modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the
income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income
tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires
entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have
not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective
application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

Except as mentioned above, we do not believe other
recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and comprehensive income and statements of cash flows.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore
are not required to provide the information requested by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under
the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due solely to the material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting related to (i) a lack of effective risk assessment process; (ii) a lack of effective overall control environment;
(iii) a lack of controls over monitoring; (iv) a lack of human resources within finance and accounting functions leading to
lack of segregation of duties; (v) a lack of information technology control design and operating effectiveness; (vi) a lack
of controls or ineffectively designed controls impacting financial reporting; (vii) an inadequate control over proper revenue recognition
and purchase cutoff; and (viii) a lack of controls over income tax. Following the identification of the material weaknesses and control
deficiencies, we plan to continue to take remedial measures including (i) hiring more qualified accounting personnel with relevant
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and SEC reporting experience and qualifications to strengthen
the financial reporting function and to set up a financial and system control framework; (ii) implementing regular and continuous
GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our accounting and financial reporting personnel; (iii) engaging an
external consulting firm to assist us with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement of overall internal control;
and (iv) appointing independent directors, establishing an audit committee and strengthening corporate governance. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEDINGS 

From time to time, claims are made against us in the
ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties
and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more
products or engaging in other activities. There were no reportable litigation events and there have been no material developments to litigation
events previously disclosed in our SEC filings during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 except as described below. 

On August 29, 2024, Beverly Hills View, Inc.( BHV brought
a lawsuit against our subsidiary Visiontech, in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that the lighting products BHV received were not
suitable for its cannabis growing operation and claiming damages of 2,500,000. The Company believes the complaint is without merit, and
Visiontech filed an answer on October 30, 2024, along with a cross-complaint on November 4, 2024, asserting that BHV failed to pay for
all the products it purchased. 

On October 22, 2024, Growterra, LLC Growterra filed a complaint against the Company and the Company s chief executive officer in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio,
alleging that it purchased lighting products from the Company, under which the Company would provide Growterra software, IP, and design
documentation related to hydroponic containers and identify Growterra as an additional insured on the Company s product liability
insurance. Growterra alleges the Company failed to perform these obligations. Growterra is alleging breach of contract, fraud, and misappropriation
of trade secrets as well as related causes of action. Growterra does not state an amount of damages but is also seeking rescission. The
Company has not yet answered. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
