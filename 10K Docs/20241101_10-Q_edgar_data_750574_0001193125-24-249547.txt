 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS 
OF 
 OPERATIONS 
 General 
 Auburn National Bancorporation, Inc. (the Company is a bank holding 
company registered with the Board of Governors 
 of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the 
 BHC Act ). The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1990, and in 
1994 it succeeded its Alabama predecessor as the 
 bank holding company controlling AuburnBank, an Alabama state member 
bank with its principal office in Auburn, 
 Alabama (the Bank ). The Company and its predecessor have controlled 
the Bank since 1984. 
As a bank holding 
 company, the Company 
may diversify into a broader range of financial services and other business activities than 
currently 
 are permitted to the Bank under applicable laws and regulations. 
The holding company structure also provides greater 
 financial and operating flexibility than is presently permitted to the 
Bank. 

 The Bank has operated continuously since 1907 and currently conducts its business 
primarily in East Alabama, including 
 Lee County and surrounding areas. 
The Bank has been a member of the Federal Reserve System since April 1995. 
The 
 Bank s primary regulators are the 
Federal Reserve and the Alabama Superintendent of Banks (the Alabama 
 Superintendent ). 
The Bank has been a member of the FHLB of Atlanta since 1991. Certain of the statements 
made in this 
 discussion and analysis and elsewhere, including information incorporated 
herein by reference to other documents, are 
 forward-looking statements as more fully described under Special Cautionary 
Notice Regarding Forward-Looking 
 Statements below. 

 The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better 
understanding of various factors related to the results 
 of operations and financial condition of the Company and the Bank. 
This discussion is intended to supplement and 
 highlight information contained in the accompanying unaudited condensed 
consolidated financial statements and related 
 notes for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 
and 2023, as well as the information contained in our 
 annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our

 ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

 Financial Summary 
 The Company s net earnings were 4.8 
million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 5.4 million for the first nine 
 months of 2023. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share were 1.38 per share for the first nine months 
of 2024, compared to 
 1.54 per share for the first nine months of 2023. 

 Net interest 
income (tax-equivalent) was 20.2 million for the first nine months 
of 2024, a 2 decrease compared to 20.6 
 million for the first nine months of 2023. 
This decrease was primarily due to a smaller balance sheet partially offset 
by an 
 increase in the Company s net interest 
margin. 
The Company s net interest margin 
(tax-equivalent) was 3.05 for the first 
 nine months of 2024 compared to 2.97 for the first nine months of 2023. 
This increase was primarily due to a more 
 favorable asset mix and higher yields on interest earning assets, which was partially 
offset by increased cost of interest-
 bearing deposits. 
Average loans for the first 
nine months of 2024 were 568.9 million, a 11 increase 
from the first nine 
 months of 2023. 
Average total securities for the 
first nine months of 2024 were 259.2 million compared to 398.8 million 
 for the first nine months of 2023. 
The decrease was primarily the result of the Company s 
balance sheet repositioning in 
 the fourth quarter of 2024. 
See Results of Operations Average 
Balance Sheet and Interest Rates and Net Interest 
 Income and Margin below. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s 
allowance for credit losses was 6.9 million, or 1.22 of total loans, compared 
to 
 6.9 million, or 1.23 of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and 6.8 
million, or 1.24 of total loans, at September 30, 
 2023.

 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses during the first nine 
months of 2024 of 0.1 
million, compared to a 
 negative provision of 0.2 million during the first nine months of 2023. 
The provision for credit losses under CECL 
 reflects the Company s 
evaluation of its credit risk profile and its future economic outlook and forecasts. 
Our CECL model 
 is largely influenced by economic factors including, most notably, 
the anticipated unemployment rate. 
The increase in the 
 provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2024, as compared 
to the first nine months of 2023, was related to 
 changes in the composition of, and increases in, loans as well as changes in 
the economic forecasts used in our CECL 
 model. 

 Noninterest income was 2.6 million in the first nine months of 2024, 
compared to 2.4 million in the first nine months of 
 2023. 
The increase was primarily related to an increase in mortgage lending income 
and other noninterest income. 
 Noninterest expense was 16.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, 
compared to 16.8 million for the first nine months 
 of 2023. 
The decrease was primarily related to decreases in net occupancy and equipment 
expense and other noninterest 
 expense. 
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits 
expense. 
 Income tax expense was 1.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 
compared to 0.7 million for the first nine months of 
 2023. 
The Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 
was 19.48 , compared to 12.05 in the first nine 
 months of 2023. 
The Company s effective 
income tax rate is affected principally by tax-exempt earnings from 
the 
 Company s investments 
in municipal securities, bank-owned life insurance BOLI ), and New Markets Tax 
Credits 
 NMTCs ). 
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a decrease 
in the Company s investment in municipal 
 securities following the balance sheet restructuring in the fourth quarter 
of 2023, and the adoption of FASB 
ASU 2023-02 
 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(Topic 323) which 
allows the proportional amortization method for our 
 NMTC investments, on January 1, 2024. 
With the adoption of this ASU, amortization 
of NMTCs are now included in 
 income tax expense rather than noninterest expense. 

 The Company paid cash dividends of 0.81 per share in the first nine months of 
2024 and 2023. 
At September 30, 2024, 
 the Bank s regulatory capital 
ratios were well above the minimum amounts required to be well capitalized 
under current 
 regulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.76 , 
a tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.43 and a common equity 
 tier 1 CET1 ratio of 14.75 at September 30, 2024. 

 For the third quarter of 2024, net earnings were 1.7 million, or 0.50 
per share, compared to 1.5 million, or 0.43 per 
 share, for the third quarter of 2023. 
Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was 6.8 million for the third quarter 
of 2024 
 compared to 6.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
The increase was primarily due a more favorable asset mix and 
 higher yields on interest earning assets partially offset 
by increases in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. 
The Company s 
 net interest margin (tax-equivalent) was 3.05 in the third 
quarter of 2024 compared to 2.73 in the third quarter of 2023. 

 The Company recorded a negative provision for credit losses during the 
third quarter of 2024 of 0.1 
million, compared to a 
 provision of 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
Noninterest income was 0.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 
 compared to 0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest 
 income. 
Noninterest expense was 5.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.4 
million for the third quarter of 
 2023. 
The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits 
expense which was 
 partially offset by decreases in net occupancy and equipment expense 
and FDIC and other regulatory assessments expense. 

 Income tax expense was 0.5 
million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.2 million for the third 
quarter of 2023. 

 This increase was due to an increase in the level of earnings before taxes and the 
Company s effective 
tax rate, which 
 increased to 23.46 in the third quarter of 2024 from 10.90 in the third quarter of 
2023. 
This increase was related to a 
 decrease in the Company s investment 
in municipal securities, and the adoption of ASU 2023-02, as described 
above.

 Net Interest Income and Margin 
 Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was 20.2 million for the first nine 
months of 2024, a 2 decrease compared to 20.6 
 million for the first nine months of 2023. 
This decrease was primarily due to a smaller balance sheet partially offset 
by a 
 increase in the Company s net interest 
margin. 
The Company s net interest margin 
(tax-equivalent) was 3.05 in the first 
 nine months of 2024 compared to 2.97 in the first nine months of 2023. 
This increase was primarily due a more 
 favorable asset mix and higher yields on interest-earning assets, which 
was partially offset by higher market interest rates, 
 which increased our cost of funds, generally, 
and changes in our deposit mix to higher cost interest bearing deposits. 
The 
 cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 180 basis points in the first nine 
months ended months of 2024, compared to 
 102 basis points in the first nine months ended months of 2023. 
Average interest-bearing 
deposits were 640.2 million 
 during the first nine months of 2024, 
a 1 decrease compared to 649.6 million during the first nine months of 2023. 
As of 
 September 30, 2024, average interest-bearing deposits were 71 of 
average total deposits compared to 69 on September 
 30, 2023. 
Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve increased the target 
federal funds rate by 525 basis points before 
 announcing a 50 basis points rate reduction on September 18, 2024, 
its first decrease in rates since its March 2020 COVID 
 rate reduction. 
At September 30, 2024, the target federal funds rate ranged from 4.75 
- 5.00 . 

 The tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets increased by 
65 basis points to 4.35 in the first nine months of 
 2024 compared to 3.70 in the first nine months of 2023. 
This increase was primarily due to the Company s 
balance sheet 
 repositioning strategy in the fourth quarter of 2023, which improved 
our asset mix, and loan growth combined with higher 
 market interest rates on interest earning assets. Average 
loans for the first nine months of 2024 were 568.9 million, an 
 11 increase from the first nine months of 
2023. 

 The cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 78 basis points to 1.80 
in the first nine months of 2024 compared 
 to 1.02 in the first nine months of 2023. 
Our deposit costs may continue to increase as we compete for deposit funds 
 against other banks, money market mutual funds, Treasury 
securities and other interest-bearing alternative investments. 
 The Company continues to deploy various asset liability management 
strategies to manage its risks from interest rate 
 fluctuations. Deposit and loan pricing remain competitive in our 
markets. 
We believe this challenging 
rate environment 
 will continue throughout 2024. 
Our ability to compete and manage our deposit costs until our interest-earning 
assets 
 reprice and we generate new loans with current market interest rates will be important 
to our net interest margin during the 
 remainder of 2024.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326 and its CECL methodology, 
which requires us to estimate all expected credit 
 losses over the remaining life of our loans. Accordingly, 
the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings 
 necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, 
is adequate to provide coverage for 
 all expected credit losses. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses during 
the first nine months of 2024 of 0.1 
 million, compared to a negative provision for credit losses of 0.2 million 
during the first nine months of 2023. 
Provision 
 expense is affected by organic loan growth 
in our loan portfolio, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan 
 portfolio, our expectations about future economic conditions and net charge 
-offs. 
Our CECL model is largely influenced 
 by economic factors including, most notably, 
the anticipated 
unemployment rate, which may be affected by monetary 
 policy. 

 Our allowance for credit losses reflects an amount we believe appropriate, 
based on our allowance assessment 
 methodology, to adequately 
cover all expected credit losses as of the date the allowance is determined. 
At September 30, 
 2024, the Company s allowance for 
credit losses was 6.9 million, or 1.22 of total loans, compared to 6.9 million, 
or 
 1.23 of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and 6.8 million, or 1.24 of 
total loans, at September 30, 2023.

 The Company s income from mortgage 
lending is primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of mortgage loans 
 and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains 
or losses from the sale of the mortgage 
 loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees, and other fees associated 
with the origination of loans, which are 
 netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. 
The Company s normal practice is to originate 
 mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or retain 
the associated MSRs when the loan is sold. 

 MSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on 
the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold. 

 Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company 
has elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method. 
Servicing 
 fee income is reported net of any related amortization expense. 

 The Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis. 
Impairment is determined by grouping MSRs by 
 common predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type. 
If the aggregate carrying amount of a particular 
 group of MSRs exceeds the group s 
aggregate fair value, a valuation allowance for that group is established. 
The valuation 
 allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. 
An increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the 
 fair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in 
a decrease in the fair value of MSRs. 

 The following table presents a breakdown of the Company s 
mortgage lending income.

 The Company s income from mortgage 
lending typically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily 
 attributable to the origination and sale of mortgage loans. 
The increase in mortgage lending income was primarily related 
 to the Company increasing the number of mortgage loans held for sale during 
2024 relative to the number of mortgage 
 loans held for investment during 2023.

 Income from bank-owned life insurance was 301 thousand and 
 311 thousand for the first nine months of 2024, 
and 2023 
 respectively. 
Excluding a 52 thousand non-taxable death benefit received during the first 
quarter of 2023, income from 
 bank-owned life insurance would have been 259 thousand for the 
first nine months of 2023. 
 Other noninterest income was 1.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, 
compared to 1.3 million for the first nine 
 months of 2023. 
The increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to increased fee income 
on one-way sell 
 reciprocal deposits sold through the Intrafi network.

 The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to routine annual increases 
in salaries and wages. 
 The decrease in net occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due 
to an increase in leasing income. 
 The decrease in other noninterest expense was primarily 
due to the Company s adoption of ASU 2023-02 
which allows the 
 proportional amortization method for our NMTC investments, on January 
1, 2024. 
With the adoption of this ASU, 
 amortization of NMTCs are now included in income tax expense. 
During the first nine months of 2023, other noninterest 
 expense included 303 thousand related to our equity method investment 
in NMTCs. 
 Income Tax 
Expense 
 Income tax expense was 1.2 million during the first nine months of

was 19.48 , compared to 12.05 in 
 the first nine months of 2023. 
The Company s effective 
income tax rate is affected principally by tax-exempt earnings 
 from the Company s investments in municipal 
securities, BOLI, and NMTCs. 
The effective tax rate increased primarily 
 due to a decrease in the Company s investment 
in municipal securities following the balance sheet restructuring in the 
 fourth quarter of 2023, and the adoption of FASB 
ASU 2023-02 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(Topic 
 323) which allows the proportional amortization method for our NMTC investments, 
on January 1, 2024. 
With the 
 adoption of this ASU, amortization of NMTCs are now included in income 
tax expense rather than noninterest expense. 

 BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 Securities 

 Securities available-for-sale were 258.3 million at September 30, 2024, 
compared to 270.9 million at December 31, 
 2023. 
This decrease reflects a 20.7 million decrease in the amortized cost basis of 
securities available-for-sale and an 
 increase in the fair value of securities available-for-sale of 8.1 million. 
The average annualized tax-equivalent yields 
 earned on total securities were 2.26 
in the first nine months of 2024 and 2.35 in the first nine months of 2023.

 Total loans were 565.7 
million at September 30, 2024, a 2 increase compared to 557.3 million 
at December 31, 2023. 

 Four loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at September 
30, 2024: commercial real estate (53 ), 
 residential real estate (21 ), construction and land development (14 
and commercial and industrial (11 ). 

 Approximately 21 of the Company s 
commercial real estate loans were classified as owner-occupied at September 30, 
 2024. 
 Within the residential real estate portfolio segment, 
the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately 10.1 million, 
 or 2 of total loans, 
and 8.7 million, or 2 , of total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
respectively. 

 For residential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, the Company 
had no loans that required interest only 
 payments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company s 
residential real estate mortgage portfolio does 
 not include any option or hybrid ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material 
amount of other consumer mortgage products 
 which are generally viewed as high risk. 

 The average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 5.18 in the first nine 
months of 2024 and 4.71 in the first 
 nine months of 2023. 

 The specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include, 
but are not limited to, the effects of 
 current economic conditions, including inflation and the continuing 
increases in market interest rates, remaining COVID-19 
 pandemic effects including supply chain disruptions, reduced 
commercial office occupancy levels, housing supply 
 shortages and inflation on our borrowers cash flows, real estate market 
sales volumes and liquidity, 
valuations used in 
 making loans and evaluating collateral, reduced credit availability, 
(especially for commercial real estate) generally and 
 higher costs of financing properties, which reduce the transaction and dollar 
volumes of commercial real estate property 
 sales. 
Other risks we face include, among other things, real estate industry 
concentrations, competitive pressures from a 
 wide range of other lenders, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate fluctuations, 
reduced collateral values or non-
 existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration 
of borrowers, fraud, and any violation of 
 applicable laws and regulations. Various 
projects financed earlier that were based on lower interest rate assumptions than 
 currently in effect may not be as profitable or successful at the 
higher interest rates currently in effect and currently 
 expected in the future. 
 The Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks through 
its loan-to-value guidelines for collateralized 
 loans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers 
financial position. Also, we have 
 established and periodically review, 
lending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank s 
credit exposure by 
 prohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10 of its capital; or 
20 of capital, if loans in excess of 10 of 
 capital are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having 
secured loan relationships in excess of 
 approximately 22.6 million. 
Furthermore, we have an internal limit for aggregate credit exposure (loans 
outstanding plus 
 unfunded commitments) to a single borrower of 20.3 million. Our loan 
policy requires that the Loan Committee of the 
 Board of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal 
limit. 
At September 30, 2024, the Bank had one 
 loan relationship exceeding our internal limit.

 We periodically 
analyze our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan 
portfolios to determine if a 
 concentration of credit risk exists in any one or more industries. We 
use classification systems broadly accepted by the 
 financial services industry in order to categorize our commercial borrowers. 
Loans to borrowers in each of the following 
 classes exceeded 25 of the Bank s 
total risk-based capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 

 On January 
1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326, which introduced the current expected loss CECL methodology, 
which 
 requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life 
of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, 
beginning in 
 2023, the allowance for credit losses represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, 
is adequate to provide 
 coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans. 
Our allowance for credit losses was approximately 6.9 
 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which our management 
believed to be adequate at each of the 
 respective dates. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total 
loans was 1.22 
at September 30, 2024, compared 
 to 1.23 
at December 31, 2023. 
 Our CECL models rely largely on projections of macroeconomic 
conditions to estimate future credit losses. 
 Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the Alabama unemployment 
rate, the Alabama home price index, the 
 national commercial real estate price index and the Alabama gross state product 
. 
Projections of these macroeconomic 
 factors, obtained from an independent third party, 
are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. 
 Under the CECL methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on 
a collective basis for pools of loans with 
 similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics 
with the collectively evaluated pools, 
 evaluations are performed on an individual basis. Losses are predicted over 
a period of time determined to be reasonable 
 and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period 
losses are reverted to long term historical averages. 
 At September 30, 2024, reasonable and supportable periods of four 
quarters were utilized followed by an eight quarter 
 straight line reversion period to long term averages. 
 A summary of the changes in the allowance for credit losses and certain 
asset quality ratios for the third quarter of 2024 and 
 the previous four quarters is presented below.

 Other Borrowings and Available 
Credit 
 The Company had no long-term debt at September 30, 2024 and December 
31, 2023. 
The Bank utilizes short and long-
 term non-deposit borrowings from time to time. Short-term borrowings 
generally consist of federal funds purchased and 
 securities sold under agreements to repurchase with an original maturity of one 
year or less. 
The Bank had available federal 
 funds lines totaling 65.2 million with no federal funds borrowings 
outstanding at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 
 2023, respectively. 
The Company had no securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which were 
entered into on behalf 
 of certain customers at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 million 
at December 31, 2023. 
The Bank is eligible to 
 borrow from the FRB s discount window, 
but had no such borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
The 
 bank never borrowed from the Federal Reserve s 
Bank Term Facility Program BTFP ), which ceased making new loans 
 on March 11, 2024. 
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta and has borrowed, and may 
in the future borrow from time to time under the 
 FHLB of Atlanta s advance program 
to obtain funding for its growth. 
FHLB advances include both fixed and variable rates 
 and are taken out with varying maturities, and are generally secured by eligible 
assets. 
The Bank had no borrowings under 
 FHLB of Atlanta s advance program 
at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
At those dates, the Bank 
 had 307.7 
million and 309.1 million, respectively, 
of available lines of credit at the FHLB of Atlanta. 
Advances include 
 both fixed and variable interest rates and varying maturities may be used. 
The Bank also has access to the FRB discount 
 window. 
 The average rate paid on the Bank s 
short-term borrowings was 0.48 in the first nine months of 2024 
compared to 2.43 
 in the first nine months of 2023. 
The Bank had average short term borrowings of 0.8 million in the first nine months of 
 2024, 
a 78 decrease compared to 3.7 million during the first nine months of 2023. 
 CAPITAL ADEQUACY 

 The Company s consolidated 
stockholders equity was 84.3 million and 76.5 million as of September 
30, 2024 and 
 December 31, 2023, respectively. 
The increase from December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by 
net earnings of 4.8 
 million and other comprehensive income due to the change 
in unrealized gains/losses on securities available-for-sale, net of 
 tax of 6.1 million, partially offset by cash dividends of 2.8 million, 
and the cumulative effect of adopting the new NMTC 
 accounting standard of 0.3 million. 
Total unrealized losses, net 
of tax, on available-for-sale securities decreased from 
 29.0 million on December 31, 2023 to 22.9 million September 30, 2024. 
These unrealized losses do not affect the 
 Bank s capital for regulatory 
capital purposes. 

 The Company paid cash dividends of 0.81 per share for both the first 
nine months of 2024 and first nine months of 2023. 

 On January 1, 2015, the Company and Bank became subject to the rules of the 
Basel III regulatory capital framework and 
 related Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changes. 
The rules included the implementation of a 
 capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum 
requirements for capital adequacy purposes. 
The capital 
 conservation buffer was subject to a three-year phase-in period 
that began on January 1, 2016 and was fully phased-in on 
 January 1, 2019 at 2.5 . 
A banking organization with a capital conservation buffer 
of less than the required amount will be 
 subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and 
certain discretionary bonus payments to 
 executive officers. 

 On August 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators 
adopted a final rule that amended the 
 capital conservation buffer. 
The new rule revises the definition of eligible retained income for purposes of 
the maximum 
 payout ratio to allow banking organizations to more freely 
use their capital buffers to promote lending and other financial 
 intermediation activities, by making the limitations on capital distributions 
more gradual. 
The eligible retained income is 
 now the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions 
and associated tax effects not reflected 
 in net income; and (ii) the average of all net income over the preceding four 
quarters. 
This rule only affects the capital 
 buffers, and banking organizations were encouraged 
to make prudent capital distribution decisions.

 The Federal Reserve has treated us as a small bank holding company under the Federal 
Reserve s Small Bank Holding 
 Company Policy. 
Accordingly, our capital 
adequacy is evaluated at the Bank level, and not for the Company and its 
 consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Bank s tier 1 leverage ratio was 10. 
43 , CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 14.75 , tier 1 
 risk-based capital ratio was 14.75 , and total risk-based capital ratio was 15.76 
at September 30, 2024. These ratios 
 exceed the minimum regulatory capital percentages of 5.0 for tier 
1 leverage ratio, 6.5 for CET1 risk-based capital 
 ratio, 8.0 for tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and 10.0 for total risk-based 
capital ratio to be considered well capitalized. 

 The Bank s capital conservation 
buffer was 7.76 at September 30, 2024 exceeded the fully phased 
-in capital conservation 
 buffer, and such buffer 
did not limit capital distributions, share repurchases or discretionary bonuses to the 
extent of 
 available earnings. 

 On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency and the 
FDIC issued a joint notice of proposed 
 rulemaking to implement the Basel III endgame components. 
The proposal which is subject to public comment and change 
 only applies to banks and holding companies with 100 billion or more of assets. 
The proposal includes provisions dealing 
 with: 
 
 Credit risk, which arises from the risk that an obligor fails to perform 
on an obligation; 
 
 Market risk, which results from changes in the value of trading positions; 
 
 Operational risk, which is the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
process, people, and 
 systems, or from external events; and 
 
 Credit valuation adjustment risk, which results from the risk of losses on 
certain derivative contracts. 
 The Basel III endgame regulatory proposals are not applicable to the Company 
or the Bank. 
The Federal Reserve has 
 indicated that it is revising and expects to re-propose these rules applicable 
to larger organizations than the Company. 
 MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Management s objective is to manage 
assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, 
consistent level of profitability within 
 the framework of established liquidity, 
loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. The Bank s 
Asset Liability 
 Management Committee ALCO is charged with the 
responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to 
 ensure an acceptable asset/liability composition. Two 
critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate risk and liquidity 
 risk management. 

 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk arising 
from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO 
 measures and evaluates interest rate risk so that the Bank can meet customer demands 
for various types of loans and 
 deposits. Measurements used to help manage interest rate sensitivity include 
an earnings simulation model and an economic 
 value of equity EVE model. 
 Earnings simulation
 . Management believes that interest rate risk is best estimated by our earnings 
simulation modeling. 
 Forecasted levels of earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, and 
off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined 
 with ALCO forecasts of market interest rates for the next 12 months and other factors 
in order to produce various earnings 
 simulations and estimates. To 
help limit interest rate risk, we have guidelines for earnings at risk which seek to 
limit the 
 variance of net interest income from gradual changes in interest rates. 
For changes up or down in rates from management s 
 flat interest rate forecast over the next 12 months, policy limits for net interest income 
variances are as follows: 
 
 +/- 20 for a gradual change of 400 basis points 
 
 +/- 15 for a gradual change of 300 basis points 
 
 +/- 10 for a gradual change of 200 basis points 
 
 +/- 5 for a gradual change of 100 basis points 
 While a gradual change in interest rates was used in the above analysis to provide an 
estimate of exposure under these 
 scenarios, our modeling under both a gradual and instantaneous change in interest 
rates indicates our balance sheet is 
 liability sensitive over the forecast period 
of 12 months. 
 At September 30, 2024, our earnings simulation model indicated that 
we were in compliance with the policy guidelines 
 noted above.

 Economic Value 
of Equity
 . EVE measures the extent that the estimated economic values of our 
assets, liabilities, and off-
 balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values 
are estimated by discounting expected 
 cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance 
sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. In contrast with our 
 earnings simulation model, which evaluates interest rate risk over a 12-month 
timeframe, EVE uses a terminal horizon 
 which allows for the re-pricing of all assets, liabilities, and off-balance 
sheet items. Further, EVE is measured using 
values 
 as of a point in time and does not reflect any actions that ALCO might take in responding 
to or anticipating changes in 
 interest rates, or market and competitive conditions. 
To help limit interest rate risk, we have 
stated policy guidelines for an 
 instantaneous basis point change in interest rates, such that our EVE should not decrease 
from our base case by more than 
 the following: 
 
 35 for an instantaneous change of +/- 400 basis points 
 
 30 for an instantaneous change of +/- 300 basis points 
 
 25 for an instantaneous change of +/- 200 basis points 
 
 15 for an instantaneous change of +/- 100 basis points 
 At September 30, 2024, our EVE model indicated that we were in compliance 
with our policy guidelines. 
 Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of 
how our net interest income will be affected by 
 changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning 
assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities 
 may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. 
In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest 
 rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, 
although certain assets and liabilities may have 
 similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different 
degrees to changes in market interest rates, and other 
 economic and market factors, including market perceptions. Interest 
rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate 
 in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types 
of assets and liabilities may lag behind 
 changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable 
rate mortgage loans, have features (generally 
 referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates. 
Prepayments 
and early withdrawal levels 
 also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of 
certain instruments. The ability of many 
 borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest 
rates or economic stress, which may 
 differ across industries and economic sectors. ALCO reviews each 
of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with 
 several different interest rate scenarios in seeking satisfactory, 
consistent levels of profitability within the framework of the 
 Company s established liquidity, 
loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. 

 The Company may also use derivative financial instruments to improve 
the balance between interest-sensitive assets and 
 interest-sensitive liabilities, and as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity while continuing 
to meet the credit and deposit 
 needs of our customers. From time to time, the Company also may 
enter into back-to-back interest rate swaps to facilitate 
 customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These interest rate swaps qualify 
as derivatives, but are not 
 designated as hedging instruments. At September 30, 2024 and December 
31, 2023, the Company had no derivative 
 contracts designated as part of a hedging relationship to assist in managing 
its interest rate sensitivity. 

 Liquidity Risk Management 

 Liquidity is the Company s ability to 
convert assets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements, 
 primarily for deposit withdrawals, loan demand and maturing obligations. 
The Company seeks to manage its liquidity to 
 manage or reduce its costs of funds by maintaining liquidity believed 
adequate to meet its anticipated funding needs, while 
 balancing against excessive liquidity that likely would reduce earnings 
due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher-
 yielding assets. 

 Liquidity is managed at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the Company. 
The second is the liquidity of the Bank. The 
 management of liquidity at both levels is essential, because the Company 
and the Bank are separate and distinct legal 
 entities with different funding needs and sources, and each are subject 
to regulatory guidelines and requirements. 
The 
 Company depends upon dividends from the Bank for liquidity to pay its operating 
expenses, debt obligations and 
 dividends, 
and Federal Reserve Regulation W restricts Company borrowings from, and other 
transactions with, the Bank. 

 The Bank s payment of dividends 
depends on its earnings, liquidity, 
capital and the absence of regulatory restrictions on 
 such dividends. 

 The primary source of funding and liquidity for the Company has been dividends 
received from the Bank. 
If needed, the 
 Company could also borrow money, 
or issue common stock or other securities. 
Primary uses of funds by the Company 
 include payment of Company expenses, dividends paid to stockholders 
and Company stock repurchases. 

Table of Contents 
 41 
 Primary sources of funding for the Bank include customer deposits, other borrowings, 
interest payments on earning assets, 
 repayment and maturity of securities and loans, 
sales of securities, and the sale of loans, particularly residential mortgage 
 loans. 
The Bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings 
from the Federal Reserve discount 
 window. In addition to 
these sources, the Bank is eligible to participate in the FHLB of Atlanta s 
advance program to obtain 
 funding for growth and liquidity. 
Advances include both fixed and variable terms and may be taken out with varying 
 maturities. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had no FHLB of Atlanta advances 
outstanding and available credit from the 
 FHLB of 307.7 million. At September 30, 2024, the Bank also had 65.2 million 
of available federal funds lines with no 
 borrowings outstanding. Primary uses of funds include repayment of maturing 
obligations and growing the loan portfolio. 

 The Company also has access to the FRB discount window. 

 Management believes that the Company and the Bank have adequate 
sources of liquidity to meet all their respective known 
 contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan 
commitments and reasonably 
expected borrower, 
 depositor, and creditor requirements over 
the next twelve months. 

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Contingencies and Contractual 
Obligations 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank had outstanding standby letters of credit 
of 0.6 million and unfunded loan commitments 
 outstanding of 77.6 million. 
Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and 
many will expire 
 without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily 
represent future cash requirements. If needed, to 
 fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank could use its cash and 
cash equivalents, 
deposits with other banks, liquidate 
 federal funds sold or a portion of our securities available-for-sale, or 
draw on its available credit facilities or raise deposits. 

 Mortgage lending activities 
 We generally 
sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae while retaining 
the servicing of these 
 loans. The sale agreements for these residential mortgage loans with Fannie Mae 
and other investors include various 
 customary representations and warranties regarding the origination 
and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. 

 Although the representations and warranties vary among investors, they 
typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of 
 the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property 
securing the loan, compliance with 
 loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, 
state, and local laws, among other 
 matters. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate unpaid principal balance of 
residential mortgage loans, which we have originated 
 and sold, but retained the servicing rights, was 207.5 million. 
Although these loans are generally sold on a non-recourse 
 basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or 
reimburse investors for losses incurred (make whole 
 requests) if a loan review reveals a potential breach of seller representations 
and warranties. 
Upon receipt of a repurchase 
 or make whole request, we work with investors to arrive at a mutually agreeable 
resolution. Repurchase and make whole 
 requests are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the 
claims made by the investor and to 
 determine if a contractually required repurchase or make whole event 
has occurred. We seek to 
reduce and manage the risks 
 of potential repurchases, make whole requests, or other claims by mortgage 
loan investors through our underwriting and 
 quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor 
and secondary market standards. 
 The Company was not required to repurchase any loans during the 
first nine months of 2024 as a result of representation 
 and warranty provisions contained in the Company s 
sale agreements with Fannie Mae, and had no pending repurchase or 
 make-whole requests at September 30, 2024. 
 We service all residential 
mortgage loans originated and sold by us to Fannie Mae. 
As servicer, our primary duties are to: 
 (1) collect payments due from borrowers; 
(2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; 
(3) maintain 
 and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating 
to the mortgage loans; 
(4) maintain any 
 required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and 
administer escrow payments; 
and (5) foreclose on 
 defaulted mortgage loans or take other actions to mitigate the potential 
losses to investors consistent with the agreements 
 governing our rights and duties as servicer. 
 The agreements 
under which we act as servicer generally specifies standards 
of responsibility for actions taken by us in 
 such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred 
by us when acting in compliance with the 
 respective servicing agreements. 
However, if we commit a material breach of 
our obligations as servicer, we may be 
 subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following 
notice. 
The standards governing 
 servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards are determined 
by our agreements 
with Fannie Mae and 
 Fannie Mae s mortgage servicing 
guides. 
Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan. 

Table of Contents 
 42 
 Although repurchase and make whole requests related to representation 
and warranty provisions and servicing activities 
 have been limited to date, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse 
investors for losses incurred 
 (make whole requests) may increase in frequency if investors more aggressively pursue 
all means of recovering losses on 
 their purchased loans. 
As of September 30, 2024, we do not believe that this exposure is material due to the historical level 
 of repurchase requests and loss trends, in addition to the fact that 99 of our residential 
mortgage loans serviced for Fannie 
 Mae were current as of such date. 
We maintain ongoing 
communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate 
 this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency 
rates in our investor 
 portfolios. 
 The Bank sells mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and services these on an actual/actual basis. 
As a result, the Bank is not 
 obligated to make any advances to Fannie Mae on principal and interest 
on such mortgage loans where the borrower is 
 entitled to forbearance. 
 Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial 
data presented herein have been prepared in 
 accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which 
require the measurement of financial position and 
 operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering 
the changes in the relative purchasing power of money 
 over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the 
assets and liabilities of a financial institution 
 are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant 
impact on a financial institution s performance 
 than the effects of general levels of inflation. 
 Inflation can increase our noninterest expenses. It also can affect 
our customers behaviors, the mix of deposits between 
 interest and noninterest bearing, and the levels of interest rates we have to 
pay on our deposits and other borrowings, and 
 the interest rates we earn on our earning assets. 
The difference between our interest expense and interest income is also 
 affected by the shape of the yield curve and the speeds at which our 
assets and liabilities, respectively, 
reprice in response 
 to interest rate changes. 
Although inflation decreased in the most recent quarter, 
the yield curve continued to be inverted 
 through September 30, 2024, which means shorter term interest rates are higher 
than longer term interest rates. 
This results 
 in a lower spread between our costs of funds and our interest income. 
In addition, net interest income could be affected by 
 asymmetrical changes in the different interest rate indexes, 
given that not all of our assets or liabilities are priced with the 
 same index. 
Higher market interest rates and reductions in the securities held by the Federal Reserve to reduce 
inflation 
 generally reduce economic activity and may reduce loan demand and growth, 
and may adversely affect unemployment 
 rates. 
Inflation and related changes in market interest rates, as the Federal Reserve maintains 
interest rates to meet its 
 longer term inflation goal of 2 , also can adversely affect 
the values and liquidity of our loans and securities, the value of 
 collateral securing loans to our borrowers, and the success of our borrowers and 
such borrowers available cash to pay 
 interest on and principal of our loans to them. 
 Beginning in March 2022, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve increased 
its target federal funds range from 0 0.25 
 to 4.25 4.50 to fight inflation. 
The target federal funds rate was increased another 25 basis points on each 
of January 
 31, March 7, May 3 and July 26, 2023 to 5.25 5.50 . 
The Federal Reserve has indicated it will maintain higher target 
 rates and restrictive monetary policy to meet its goals of (i) 2 target 
inflation rate over the longer term and (ii) maximum 
 employment goals. 
The Federal Reserve s Open Market Committee FOMC reaffirmed its commitment in May 2024 to 
 the 2 inflation objective and announced that it does not expect it will be appropriate 
to reduce the target range until it has 
 gained greater confidence that inflation is moving substantially toward 2 . 
Further, beginning in June 2024, the FOMC 
 relaxed its monetary policy by slowing its monthly reduction of 
Treasury securities from 60 billion to 25 billion, while 
 maintaining the 35 monthly reduction of agency debt and agency mortgage 
-backed securities at 35 billion. 
 On September 18, 2024, in light of inflation moderating, the FOMC reduced its target 
federal funds rate range by 50 basis 
 points to 4.75 to 5.00 . 
While the FOMC reaffirmed its target inflation rate of 2 over 
the longer run, it indicated it was 
 recalibrating its policy based on decreasing inflation rates and the risks of 
increasing unemployment, but would act on 
 incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of the risks of inflation 
and unemployment levels. 
In the future, the 
 Federal Reserve could further decrease target interest 
rates, or could increase such target rates, depending on the data 
and 
 its outlook. 

Table of Contents 
 43 
 Our deposit costs increased as the Federal Reserve increased its target federal 
funds rate to fight inflation, market interest 
 rates increased, and as customers moved to interest bearing deposits to earn 
interest on their funds, and at higher interest 
 rates. 
Monetary policy efforts to control inflation may also affect 
unemployment which is an important component in our 
 CECL model used to estimate our allowance for credit losses. 
As inflation and market interest rates and expectations 
 regarding these declined in the three months ended September 30, 2024, 
the values of our securities investments held for 
 sale increased, which increased our stockholders equity. 

 See Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report for additional information about 
inflation, interest rates and related risks.

 Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), this quarterly 
 report on Form 10-Q includes certain designated net interest income 
amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-
 GAAP financial measure, including the presentation and calculation 
of the efficiency ratio. 

 The Company believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent 
basis provides comparability of net 
 interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability 
within the industry. Although 
the 
 Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors 
understanding of its business and performance, 
 these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative 
to GAAP. 
The reconciliations 
of these non-
 GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures 
are presented below.

 ITEM 3. 
QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The information called for by ITEM 3 is set forth in ITEM 2 under the 
caption MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK 
 MANAGEMENT and is incorporated herein by reference. 

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company, with the participation 
of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, 
 carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and 
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as 
 defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the 
 period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation and as of the end of the period covered 
by this report, the 
 Company s Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s 
disclosure controls and 
 procedures were effective to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure 
in its reports that the Company files or submits to 
 the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended. There have been no 
 changes in the Company s internal 
control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report 
 that have materially affected, or are reasonably 
likely to materially affect, the Company s 
internal control over financial 
 reporting. 
 PART 
II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 In the normal course of its business, the Company and the Bank are, from time to time, 
involved in legal proceedings. The 
 Company s and Bank s 
management believe there are no pending or threatened legal, governmental, 
or regulatory 
 proceedings that, upon resolution, are expected to have a material adverse effect 
upon the Company s or the Bank s 
 financial condition or results of operations. See also, Part I, Item 3 of the Company s 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
 year ended December 31, 2023. 

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider 
the factors discussed in Part I, 
 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
in the Company s Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, 
 which could materially affect our business, financial condition 
or future results. The risks described in our annual report on 
 Form 10-K are not the only the risks facing our Company. 
The persistence of inflation above the Federal Reserve s 
long 
 term targets, and the maintenance of or further increases in, 
tightened Federal Reserve monetary policy by increased target 
 interest rates and reductions in the Federal Reserve s 
securities portfolio, have and are expected to continue to affect 
the 
 levels of interest rates, mortgage originations and income, the market values of 
our securities portfolio and loans and have 
 resulted in unrealized losses that have adversely affected our stockholders 
equity. 
These have affected and are expected to 
 continue to affect our deposit costs and mixes, and consumer savings 
and payment behaviors. 
These may also affect our 
 borrower s operating costs, expected returns and cash flows 
available to service our loans. 
Additional risks and 
 uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be 
immaterial also may materially adversely affect our 
 business, financial condition, and/or operating results in the future.
