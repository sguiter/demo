 million and million , respectively, and cash outflow from operating activities of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of billion . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of million . The Company is required to comply with certain covenants under the SLR Credit Facility Agreements (as defined in Note 7) including ones relating to financial reporting and the delivery of an unqualified audit opinion, the maintenance of minimum cash or revenue, the incurrence of additional debt, and its ability to make capital expenditures or declare dividends. If the Company fails to comply with any covenants, payments or other terms of either SLR Credit Facility Agreement, its agent or lender, as applicable, could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. Further details of obligations under the SLR Credit Facility Agreements are described in Note 7. While the Company has taken actions to reduce operating expenses and working capital to align with anticipated revenue growth including implementing restructuring plans to streamline its overall organizational structure and renegotiating commitments with suppliers to reduce inventory, management expects to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future and to incur operating losses in the near term while the Company makes investments to support its anticipated growth. Furthermore, on September 23, 2024, the Company received notice from the Listing Qualifications staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) that it no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. If the Company is unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within the applicable compliance period, or is unable to otherwise maintain compliance with other applicable Nasdaq listing rules, it may not be able to maintain the listing of its common stock on Nasdaq, which could adversely affect its ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to it, or at all. Management believes that the Company s existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from sales, and proceeds received from the debt financing described in Note 7, will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of the accompanying condensed financial statements. Basis of Presentation The accompanying condensed financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, that are necessary for the fair statement of the Company s financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The financial data and the other financial information disclosed in these notes to the condensed financial statements related to the three- and nine-month periods are also unaudited. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for any other future annual or interim period. The condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 21, 2024 (2023 Annual Report). All share amounts disclosed in the notes to the condensed financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand except for per share data.

Revenue under these agreements is recognized over the related service period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million and million of previously deferred revenue, respectively.

The unrealized losses on the Company s available-for-sale debt securities were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Additional factors considered in determining the treatment of unrealized losses include the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the extent of the loss related to the credit of the issuer, and the expected cash flows from the security. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did t recognize credit loss related to available-for-sales debt securities.

Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at invoice value, net of any allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based on the Company s assessment of its best estimate of the amount of credit losses in customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as existing contractual payment terms, historical collection experience, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay. The Company writes off accounts receivable when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance in the period the payment is received. Credit losses from continuing operations have consistently been within management s expectations.

SLR Revolver The SLR Revolving Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility with aggregate revolving commitments of million (the Initial Revolver Commitment). The Company may request to increase the aggregate revolving commitments by million (the Additional Tranche) to an aggregate amount of million, subject to ABL Lender s approval. Amounts available to be drawn under the SLR Revolver are equal to the lesser of (i) outstanding revolving commitments under the SLR Revolving Credit Agreement and (ii) a borrowing base (the Borrowing Base) equal to the sum of (a) of eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) of eligible inventory (not to exceed the lesser of of the Borrowing Base and million), minus (c) customary reserves, minus (d) unposted cash.

on the first anniversary of the original vesting date, , with the balance vesting quarterly over the remaining three years. Since 2022, the Company has granted a mix of PSUs and RSUs to its CEO, and a mix of PSUs and RSUs to its other executive officers and certain other senior leaders on an annual basis. The PSUs are earned and vest based on achievement against two metrics: The Home PSUs are earned based on the number of patients treating at home on Tablo as of the end of the second or third year following the grant date (Year 2 or Year 3), with earned units vesting either (i) after certification of achievement following the end of Year 2 and at the end of Year 3 or (ii) after certification of achievement following the end of Year 3 (performance-based vesting conditions). 

 The Relative TSR PSUs are earned based on the Company's relative total stockholder return (relative TSR) at the end of a two-year or three-year performance period as compared to companies in a pre-determined index of medical device companies, in each case, with 100 of earned units vesting on, or after certification of achievement following, the third anniversary of the grant date (market-based vesting conditions). 

 The number of units earned varies based on actual performance as follows: (i) from to for the CEO) of the target number of the Home PSUs granted, (ii) from to for the CEO) of the target number of Relative TSR PSUs granted in 2022 and 2023 and (iii) from to for the CEO) of the target number of Relative TSR PSUS granted in 2024. The grant date for the Home PSUs is not considered established until the Compensation Committee of the Board approves the target and it is communicated to the award recipients, which then triggers the service inception date, the fair value of the awards, and the associated expense recognition period. Once the grant date for the Home PSUs has been established, the related stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on the forecasted performance, which is reassessed each reporting period based on the probability of achieving the performance conditions. In 2024, the Company also granted a new type of PSU award to executive officers and certain other senior leaders which is earned and vests based on appreciation of the Company s stock price above pre-determined stock price triggers or achievement of specified operating income targets over a performance period of up to three years.

 Overview 
 Our technology is designed to elevate the dialysis experience for patients and help providers overcome traditional care delivery challenges. Requiring only an electrical outlet and tap water to operate, our Tablo Hemodialysis System (Tablo) frees patients and providers from the burdensome infrastructure required to operate traditional dialysis machines. The integration of water purification and on-demand dialysate production in a single 35-inch compact console enables Tablo to serve as a dialysis clinic on wheels. With a simple-to-use touchscreen interface, two-way wireless data transmission and a proprietary data analytics platform, Tablo is a holistic approach to dialysis care. Unlike existing hemodialysis machines, which have limited clinical versatility across care settings, Tablo can be used seamlessly across multiple care settings and a wide range of clinical applications. Tablo is cleared by the FDA for use in the hospital, clinic, or home setting. 
 Tablo leverages cloud technology, making it possible for providers to monitor devices remotely, view treatment data, perform patient and population analytics, and automate clinical recordkeeping. Tablo's wireless connectivity enables us to release training, new features and enhancements over-the-air without interventions by field service engineers (FSEs). Tablo s connectedness allows continuous streaming of over 500,000 device performance data points to the cloud for every treatment. We use this data, in conjunction with our diagnostic and predictive algorithms, to monitor device performance, identify and diagnose failures and, in some instances, predict and prevent potential future device failures or malfunctions. In effect, this contributes to a reduction in service hours and an increase in device uptime. 
 We have generated meaningful evidence to demonstrate that providers can realize significant operational efficiencies, including reducing the cost of their dialysis programs by up to 80 in the intensive care unit. In addition, Tablo has been shown to deliver robust clinical care. In studies and surveys we have conducted, patients have reported quality of life benefits on Tablo compared to other dialysis machines. We believe Tablo empowers patients, who have traditionally been passive recipients of care, to regain agency and ownership of their treatment. 
 Driving adoption of Tablo in the acute care setting has been our primary focus to date. We have invested in growing our economic and clinical evidence, built a veteran sales and clinical support team with significant expertise, and implemented a comprehensive training and customer experience program. Our experience in the acute care market has demonstrated Tablo s clinical flexibility and operational versatility, while also delivering meaningful cost savings to the providers. We plan to continue leveraging our commercial infrastructure to broaden our installed base in the acute care market, as well as driving utilization and fleet expansion with our existing customers. 
 16 

Tablo is also utilized for home-based dialysis. We believe our ability to reduce training time, patient dropout, and the supplies and infrastructure required to deliver dialysis in the home can drive efficiency and economic improvements to the home care model. In our home investigational device exemption (IDE) trial, patients reported specific quality of life improvements compared to their experience on the incumbent home dialysis machine. To penetrate this market successfully, we continue to focus on refining our home distribution, logistics and support systems to help ensure they are ready for scale. We are also working with providers, patients, and payors to increase awareness and adoption of transitional care units (TCUs) as a bridge to home-based therapy. 
 We generate revenue from the placement of Tablo consoles along with accessories, and shipping and handling charged to customers, which revenue is recognized up-front. We also earn recurring revenue from sales of consumables, including Tablo cartridges, and services, which generates significant total revenue over the life of Tablo consoles. Our total revenues were 28.7 million and 30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 84.2 million and 99.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We primarily sell our solutions through our direct sales organization, which covers most major metropolitan markets in the United States. Our sales organization is comprised of our capital sales team, responsible for generating new customer demand for Tablo, and our clinical sales team, responsible for driving utilization and fleet expansion of Tablo at existing customer sites. In addition, our field service team provides maintenance services and product support to our customers. Our field sales and service teams represent 50 of our total full-time employees as of September 30, 2024. The same sales organization and field service team drive Tablo penetration in both the acute and home markets. We believe the ability to leverage one team to serve both markets will result in significant productivity and cost optimization as we continue to scale our business. 
 Recent Developments 
 In July 2023, we received a warning letter (the Warning Letter) from the FDA that raised two observations. The first observation asserted that certain content reviewed by the FDA and found on our website promoted continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), a modality outside of the current indications for Tablo. The second observation asserted that TabloCart with Prefiltration requires prior 510(k) clearance for marketing authorization. TabloCart with Prefiltration is an accessory to Tablo launched in the third quarter of 2022. We believe the concern raised by the first observation regarding CRRT promotion has been effectively addressed through a thorough review of existing promotional materials and practices. We believe the concern raised by the second observation regarding TabloCart with Prefiltration has also been effectively addressed. Although we evaluated TabloCart with Prefiltration prior to marketing and distributing the product and concluded that no marketing authorization was necessary, we paused distribution of TabloCart with Prefiltration pending the FDA s review and clearance of a 510(k) application that we submitted in September 2023. In early May 2024, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for TabloCart with Prefiltration, and we have resumed distribution of TabloCart with Prefiltration. We believe we have now taken appropriate measures to fully address the matters raised in the Warning Letter. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our financial performance has been and in the foreseeable future will continue to be primarily driven by the following factors. While we believe each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations. Our ability to successfully address the factors below is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors. 
 Market Acceptance of Tablo in Acute Setting 
 We plan to further broaden our installed base by continuing to target national and regional integrated delivery networks and health systems, sub-acute long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). In addition, we focus on driving utilization and fleet expansion with existing customers by providing an exceptional user experience delivered through our commercial team and a steady release of software enhancements that amplify Tablo s operational reliability and clinical versatility. Our ability to successfully execute on this strategy, and thereby increase our revenue in the acute market, will depend on several factors. These factors include our ability to recover from the adverse impact in the field from the Warning Letter as we resume distribution of TabloCart with Prefiltration, as well as the success of our initiatives to optimize our commercial organization, infrastructure and sales processes to support the growth of our business in the acute care market as we focus more heavily on enterprise selling and transition beyond earlier stage adoption of Tablo. 
 Expansion of Tablo within the Home Setting 
 We believe that a significant growth opportunity exists within the home hemodialysis market. We are partnering with innovative dialysis clinic providers, health systems and other adjacent healthcare providers who are motivated to grow their home hemodialysis population, and who share our vision of creating a seamless and supported transition to the home. We are also investing in market development over the longer term to expand the home hemodialysis market itself. The expansion of the home hemodialysis market and our ability to penetrate this market will be an important factor in driving the future growth of our business. In addition, the 
 17 

success of our efforts to expand within the home market, help grow new home programs and increase our revenue generated from home-based dialysis on the timeline that we anticipate will depend on several factors. These factors include the success of our initiatives to optimize and further evolve our commercial organization, infrastructure and sales processes as we scale our business in the home market. 
 Gross Margin Expansion 
 Our ability to expand our gross margins depends on: first, our ability to continue to sell Tablo cartridges, services, and accessories for Tablo consoles; second, our ability to reduce the cost of service and third, our ability to reduce the cost of Tablo consoles. Our ability to expand gross margins will also depend in part on our ability to control the average selling prices of our products and services, including by selling higher-margin accessories, consumables and services. Further, we will continue to utilize our cloud-based data system, as well as enhanced product performance, to better support our field service team and drive down service costs per console. In addition, over the past several years, we have moved the production of Tablo consoles and a majority of Tablo cartridges in-house to our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico which we operate in collaboration with TACNA as part of our cost reduction activities. This has helped further our long-term gross margin expansion and supply continuity strategies while reducing the costs of Tablo console production and improving the flexibility of our operations. We will continue our cost reduction activities by using our design, engineering, supply chain and manufacturing capabilities to help further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, lowering the cost of parts and components and lowering our costs of production. Our ability to expand gross margins depends on our ability to successfully execute these strategies. 
 Profitability Initiatives 
 Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on several key factors: first, our ability to grow our revenue while expanding gross margins, as discussed above; second, our ability to optimize operating expenses; and third, our ability to optimize working capital. We have undertaken various initiatives designed to improve operational efficiencies, reduce operating expenses to align with anticipated levels of revenue growth and streamline our overall cost structure, including two organizational restructurings implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024. In connection with steps we are taking to help optimize our commercial organization, in the third quarter of 2024, we completed an additional restructuring primarily impacting our commercial organization. We are also taking steps to improve our ability to efficiently manage working capital, including inventory. Our ability to transition to profitability will depend on the success of our efforts to optimize spending and working capital, including inventory. 
 Impacts of Macroeconomic Factors 
 Global macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, increased labor costs, staffing shortages and global supply chain disruptions, may impact our business and results of operations, and those of our customers, manufacturing partners and suppliers. As the duration and severity of these macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain and depend on various factors, we cannot predict what effects these macroeconomic conditions will ultimately have on our business and results of operations, our customers, or our suppliers. 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we began to observe an increasing number of our existing and prospective customers deferring their decisions to purchase Tablo in an environment of rising interest rates and more cautious capital spending. These deferrals served to elongate our sales cycle and the timing of delivery and installations, which, in turn, contributed to an adverse impact on our bookings and revenues starting in the second half of 2023, and we expect these negative impacts to continue through at least the remainder of 2024. Beginning in 2022, our existing and prospective customers faced shortages of skilled nurses and other clinical personnel as well as increased labor costs, combined with economic pressures resulting from general economic and financial market conditions, primarily escalating inflation, tightening hospital operating budgets and increased scrutiny of capital purchase decisions, all of which generally have the effect of lengthening the average sales cycle and elongating the timing of installations. These factors negatively impacted our customer base on pipeline development and installation schedules, which, in turn, negatively impacted our bookings, delayed our shipments and adversely impacted our revenues for 2022 and, to a lesser extent, 2023. We have generally seen some stabilization in these challenging labor market dynamics for healthcare providers during 2023 and thereafter as compared to 2022. Moreover, we believe Tablo offers automation and ease-of-use benefits over traditional machines that can enhance our existing and potential customers ability to support their patient populations despite staffing shortages. However, if our customers continue to face prolonged periods of rising interest rates, capital budget constraints, volatility, uncertainty, staffing shortages, cash flow challenges, rising costs and other financial pressures, whether due to general macroeconomic conditions, cybersecurity events or otherwise, it could ultimately adversely impact our ability to expand existing customer relationships or attract new customers of Tablo, timely collect amounts due, effectively manage our inventory levels, and have a material adverse effect on our bookings, revenues, results of operations, financial condition, and, ultimately, our future growth and profitability. 
 In 2022, we launched a pilot clinical and administrative services program designed to help bridge our healthcare provider customers, particularly those challenged by staffing shortages, as they transition from using an outsourced inpatient dialysis provider to offering on-site inpatient dialysis services on their own. In return for a fair market value service fee, we assign members of our own employed nurses on a temporary basis to support participating providers to launch and manage an inpatient dialysis program using 
 18 

Tablo and, as full-time staff is hired, to help train and onboard those nurses. However, our pilot clinical and administrative services program may not be successful in achieving the objectives we intend and anticipate, may fail to meet our customers expectations, may not generate sufficient returns to justify our investment, or may result in unanticipated costs, which could harm our reputation and customer relationships, and adversely impact our operating margins and results of operations. 
 From a supply chain perspective, we have worked closely with our manufacturing partners and suppliers to enable us to source key components and maintain appropriate inventory levels to meet customer demand, and have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain to date. However, macroeconomic factors such as rising inflation, increasing labor costs, and surges and shifts in consumer demand have disrupted the operations of certain of our third-party suppliers, resulting, in some cases, in increased lead times and higher component costs. We believe that localizing production of a majority of Tablo cartridges in Mexico (to our Mexico-based contract manufacturer and, more recently, in-house at our manufacturing facility) has helped achieve cost reductions through lower freight costs, further our long-term gross margin expansion and supply continuity strategies and improve the flexibility of our operations. However, we may face increased supply chain constraints in the future, which could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely impact our operating margins and results of operations.

These improvements in gross profit and gross margin were primarily driven by a higher mix of consumable and service and other revenue than consoles in the current year as compared to the prior year. Consumables had a higher gross margin than consoles and had improved gross margin year over year. The higher consumable gross margin mainly resulted from lower cost per unit as well as a higher average selling price for consumables.

The changes in interest income and other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year were driven by the changes in interest rates. 
 The increases in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to a higher outstanding balance under the SLR Term Loan Facility in 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations. To date, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock, revenue from sales, debt financing, and proceeds from employee exercise of stock options and ESPP purchases. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of 179.0 million. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the SLR Credit Facility Agreements, including ones relating to financial reporting and the delivery of an unqualified audit opinion, the maintenance of minimum cash or revenue, the incurrence of additional debt, and our ability to make capital expenditures or declare dividends. If we fail to comply with any covenants, payments or other terms of either SLR Credit Facility Agreement, our agent or lender, as applicable, could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. For further details, see Note 7 of the accompanying condensed financial statements above, as well as the section entitled Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A below. 
 While we have taken actions to reduce operating expenses and working capital to align with anticipated revenue growth including implementing restructuring plans to streamline our overall organizational structure and renegotiating commitments with suppliers to reduce inventory, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future and to incur operating losses in the near term while we make investments to support our anticipated growth. We may raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity financing, debt financings, which may require refinancing or amending the terms of our existing debt, or other sources. If this financing is not available to us at adequate levels or on acceptable terms, we may need to further evaluate our operating plans. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing (including through our existing debt), we may be subject to an increase in our interest expense which may negatively affect our cash flow. 
 On September 23, 2024, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications staff of Nasdaq that we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. If we are unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within the applicable compliance period, or are unable to otherwise maintain compliance with other applicable Nasdaq listing rules, we may not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, which could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. For further details, see the section entitled Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A below. 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from sales, and proceeds received from the debt financing described in Note 7 of the accompanying condensed financial statements above, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of this Quarterly Report.

Operating Activities 
 The net cash used in operating activities of 99.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a net loss of 102.3 million, the amortization of premiums on investments of 3.9 million and a net cash outflow from the change in our operating assets and liabilities of 27.8 million, which were adjusted by stock-based compensation expense of 24.4 million, depreciation and amortization of 4.3 million, non-cash interest expense of 1.9 million, allowance for credit losses of 1.8 million, non-cash lease expense of 1.1 million, and provision for inventories of 0.6 million. The net cash outflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in inventories, decreases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments, a decrease in accrued compensation and related benefit, an increase in accounts receivable resulting from the timing of collection and decreases in accrued warranty liability and operating lease liabilities. The net cash outflow from operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in deferred revenue due to growth in our business. 
 Investing Activities 
 The net cash used in investing activities of 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the purchases of short-term investment securities of 150.5 million and the purchases of property and equipment of 0.9 million, which was partially offset by the maturities of short-term investment securities of 147.1 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 The net cash provided by financing activities of 68.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the net proceeds of 66.5 million from borrowings under the SLR Term Loan Facility and the proceeds from employee exercises of stock options and ESPP purchases. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based on the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no new or significant changes in our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our market risks related to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates are described in Part II Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , of our 2023 Annual Report. Our exposure to market risks has not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 
 22 

15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The information set forth under Litigation in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes accompanying our unaudited condensed financial statements in this Quarterly Report is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report, as updated by the risk factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2024 (Q1 2024 Quarterly Report) and June 30, 2024 (Q2 2024 Quarterly Report), which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our 2023 Annual Report, as updated by our Q1 2024 Quarterly Report and Q2 2024 Quarterly Report, except as set forth below. The risks described in our 2023 Annual Report, Q1 2024 Quarterly Report and Q2 2024 Quarterly Report, as updated below, are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not precisely known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also arise and materially impact our business. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. 
 We may not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, which could adversely affect our liquidity and the trading volume and market price of our common stock. 
 Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed securities, including a minimum bid price requirement. 
 On September 23, 2024, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that, because the closing bid price for our common stock had fallen below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 24, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days prior to March 24, 2025. If we do not regain compliance by March 24, 2025, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period if we apply to transfer the listing of our common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market and meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of our publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and provide written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. As part of its review process, Nasdaq will make a determination as to whether it believes we will be able to cure this deficiency. If Nasdaq staff determines that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. We would have the right to appeal any determination to delist our common stock, and our common stock would remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market until the appeal process is complete. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, otherwise maintain compliance with other applicable Nasdaq listing rules, or be successful in appealing any delisting determination. If Nasdaq delists our common stock, it is unlikely that we will be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange and, as a result, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we and our stockholders could face significant adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations and analyst coverage for our common stock, and reduced liquidity for trading of our securities, all of which would likely reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, our common stock could be considered a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in reduced trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock. Delisting could result in additional adverse consequences including reduced ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, as well as the potential loss of confidence of our customers, suppliers and employees, any of which could harm our business and future prospects. Even the perception that we are at heightened risk of delisting could also result in certain of the above these consequences, which could negatively impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock, and harm our stockholders and our business. 
 Litigation and other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business. 
 From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property matters, product liability claims, employee claims, tort or contract claims, federal regulatory investigations, securities class action and other legal proceedings or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. For example, on August 29, 2024 and October 18, 2024, two 
 24 

purported stockholder class action lawsuits were filed against the Company, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about our business, operations and prospects related to the sale and marketing of the Tablo Hemodialysis System and TabloCart with Prefiltration, including concerning the impact of certain FDA processes for these products on our revenue growth. The second lawsuit additionally names our former Chief Financial Officer as a defendant. For further information, see the section entitled Litigation in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and can result in excessive or unanticipated verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or for agreements to change the way we operate our business, or both. There may be an increase in the scope of these matters or there may be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers confidence and reduce long-term demand for Tablo, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. 
 The terms of our credit agreement require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants, place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility and subject us to interest rate risk, and our ability to access additional borrowings is subject to us achieving certain net revenue milestones and obtaining lenders credit approval. 
 We entered into the SLR Credit Facilities on November 3, 2022, which provide for (i) up to 250.0 million of term loans pursuant to the SLR Loan Agreement and (ii) up to a 50.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility pursuant to the SLR Revolving Credit Agreement. We have already borrowed 200.0 million of term loans, the full amount available under certain borrowing limitations that limit the maximum principal amount outstanding under the SLR Credit Facilities. In addition, additional borrowings under the SLR Credit Facilities are subject to us achieving certain net revenue milestones and/or obtaining lenders credit approval. As a result, we cannot rely on further borrowings under the SLR Credit Facilities to fund our operations. In addition, principal amounts outstanding under each of the SLR Term Loan Facility and the SLR Revolver accrue interest at variable interest rates tied to SOFR. As a result, our borrowings under the facilities are subject to interest rate risk. An adverse change in interest rates for our borrowings would increase our borrowing costs which may restrict our access to capital in the future and, ultimately, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Obligations SLR Debt Financing. 
 The SLR Credit Facility Agreements contain customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, requirements as to financial reporting (including the timely delivery of audited financial statements together with an unqualified report from our independent registered accountants thereon) and insurance and restrictions on our ability to dispose of our business or property, to change our line of business, to liquidate or dissolve, to enter into any change in control transaction, to merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, to incur additional indebtedness, to incur liens on our property or to pay any dividends or other distributions on capital stock. Accordingly, the terms may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions. In addition, the SLR Credit Facility Agreements also include a financial covenant that, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023, requires us to either (i) maintain certain levels of cash and cash equivalents in accounts subject to control agreements in favor of Agent and ABL Lender of at least the sum of (a) 50 of the outstanding obligations under the SLR Term Loan Facility and (b) the amount of the Company s accounts payable that have not been paid within 120 days from the invoice date thereof or (ii) generate net product and product related revenue in excess of specified amounts and maintain gross profit margins in excess of specified percentages, in each case, for applicable measuring periods. If we fail to comply with any covenants, payments or other terms of either SLR Credit Facility Agreement, our agent or lender, as applicable, could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, our agent or lender, as applicable, would have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the applicable SLR Credit Facility Agreement. If the debt under either SLR Credit Facility Agreement was accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient assets to repay this debt, which would harm our business and financial condition.
