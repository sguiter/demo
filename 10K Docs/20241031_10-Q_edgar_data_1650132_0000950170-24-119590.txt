Subsequently, Darden distributed all of our outstanding shares of common stock pro rata to holders of Darden common stock whereby each Darden shareholder received one share of our common stock for every three shares of Darden common stock held at the close of business on the record date, which was November 2, 2015, as well as cash in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock which they would have otherwise received. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust (a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016, and we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain. As a REIT, we will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of net income that is distributed to our shareholders. However, FCPT s taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS will generally be subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. We made our REIT election upon the filing of our 2016 tax return.

 cash flow hedge in connection with the million Term Loan that was entered into on March 11, 2024 and funded on March 14, 2024. This cash flow hedge had a total notional value of million and was entered into in August 2023 to hedge the interest rate on a future offering or term loan. The swap was terminated on February 28, 2024, with the corresponding asset of thousand which will be amortized over the next years as an increase to interest expense. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt. We estimate that over the next twelve months an additio nal million will be reclassified to earnings as a reduction to interest expense. Non-designated Hedges We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets, the Company considers, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available, and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires the Company to forecast its business and general economic environment in future periods. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, thousand and thousand, respectively, was recorded as a deferred tax benefit re lated to routine book-tax differences within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In connection with the Company s ATM programs, the Company may enter into forward sale agreements with certain financial institutions acting as forward purchasers whereby, at the Company's discretion, the forward purchasers may borrow and sell shares of common stock. The use of forward sale agreements allows the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of common stock at the time the respective forward sale agreements are executed but defer settling the forward sale agreements and receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company executed forward sale agreements with financial institutions acting as forward purchasers under the ATM programs to sell shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of per share before sales commissions and offering expenses.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , FCPT OP did not issue any OP units for consideration in real estate transactions. Generally, OP units participate in net income allocations and distributions and entitle their holder the right, subject to the terms set forth in the partnership agreement, to require FCPT OP to redeem all or a portion of the OP units held by such limited partner. At FCPT OP s option, it may satisfy this redemption with cash or by exchanging non-registered shares of FCPT common stock on a -for-one basis. Prior to the redemption of OP units, the limited partners participate in net income allocations and distributions i n a manner equivalent to the common stockholders. The redemption value of outstanding non-controlling interest OP units was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, FCPT was the own er of approximately of FCPT s OP units. The remaining , or of FCPT s OP units were held by unaffiliated limited partners.

Derivative Financial Instruments Currently, we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk associated with our notes payable. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties. We have determined that the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to our derivative contracts, which determination was based on the fair value of each individual contract, was not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, all of our derivatives held at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation and a real estate investment trust REIT which owns, acquires and leases properties for use in the restaurant and retail industries. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Four Corners Operating Partnership, LP FCPT OP ), a Delaware limited partnership of which we are a majority limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, Four Corners GP, LLC FCPT GP ), is its sole general partner. We believe that we have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2023, and we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 Our revenues are primarily generated by leasing properties to tenants through net lease arrangements under which the tenants are primarily responsible for ongoing costs relating to the properties, including utilities, property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, and maintenance and repair costs. We focus on income producing properties leased to high quality tenants in major markets across the United States. We also generate revenues by operating seven LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants located in the San Antonio, Texas area (the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business pursuant to franchise agreements with Darden. 
 In addition to managing our existing properties, our strategy includes investing in additional restaurant and retail properties to grow and diversify our existing portfolio. We expect this acquisition strategy will decrease our reliance on Darden and help us gain exposure to non-restaurant retail properties over time. We intend to purchase properties that are well located, occupied by durable concepts, with creditworthy tenants whose operating cash flows are expected to meaningfully exceed their lease payments to us. We seek to improve the probability of successful tenant renewal at the end of initial lease terms by acquiring properties that have high levels of operator profitability compared to rent payments and have absolute rent levels that generally reflect market rates. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, FCPT acquired 42 properties for a total investment value of 136.7 million, including transaction costs. These properties are 100 occupied under net leases with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.7 years. 
 At September 30, 2024, our lease portfolio had the following characteristics: 
 1,153 properties located in 47 states and representing an aggregate leasable area of 7.8 million square feet; 

99.6 occupancy (based on leasable square footage);

An average remaining lease term of 7.3 years (weighted by annualized base rent); 

An average annual rent escalation of 1.4 through December 31, 2029 (weighted by annualized base rent);

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Real Estate Operations 
 Rental Revenue 
 Rental revenue increased 2.0 million, or 3.6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due primarily to the acquisition of 48 leased properties during the year-over-year period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by the disposal of one property during the period. We do not anticipate the disposition to have a material impact on future revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized variable lease revenue, including costs paid by the lessor and reimbursed by the lessees within rental revenue of 2.1 million as compared to 2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts are also recognized in property expenses. 
 We recognize rental income on a straight-line basis to include the effect of base rent escalators, and free rent periods, if any. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expense is comprised of costs associated with staff, office rent, legal, accounting, information technology, and other professional services and other administrative services in association with our real estate operations and our REIT structure and reporting requirements. General and administrative expenses increased 349 thousand, or 6.3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in cash compensation-related expenses and increased non-cash stock compensation expense. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense represents the depreciation on real estate investments that have estimated lives ranging from two to fifty-five years. Depreciation and amortization increased by approximately 0.2 million, or 1.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the acquisition of 48 properties, during the year-over-year period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. 
 29 

Property Expense 
 We record all tenant expenses, both reimbursed and non-reimbursed, to property expense. We also record initial direct costs (lease negotiation and other previously capitalizable transaction expenses) as property expenses. Other property expenses consist of expenses incurred on vacant properties, abandoned deal costs, and franchise taxes. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded property expenses of 2.6 million, of which 2.1 million was reimbursed by tenants. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded property expenses of 2.9 million, of which 2.4 million was reimbursed by tenants. 
 Interest Expense 
 We incur interest expense on our 515 million of term loans, any outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, interest rate swaps, and our 625 million of senior fixed rate notes. Interest expense increased by less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the issuance of the additional 85 million term loan in March 2024, which was offset by a reduction of interest expense due to the repayment of the 50 million senior unsecured fixed rate note. 
 Realized Gain on Sale, Net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not sell any properties. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold two properties with a net book value of 9.5 million for a realized gain on sale of 318 thousand. 
 Income Taxes 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax expense was 90 thousand. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax benefit of 89 thousand. The income tax provision consists of federal, state, and local income taxes incurred by the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business, and state and local income taxes we incurred on our lease portfolio. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net deferred tax asset at the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business increased by 61 thousand. This deferred tax benefit related to routine book-tax differences and was recorded within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Restaurant Operations 
 Restaurant revenues decreased by less than 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to city construction projects outside two locations, partially offset by higher net pricing. 
 Total restaurant expenses decreased by 200 thousand, or 2.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to improved staffing and a reduction in overtime hours. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Real Estate Operations 
 Rental Revenue 
 Rental revenue increased 14.1 million, or 8.7 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to the acquisition of 48 leased properties during the year-over-year period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by the disposal of one property during the period. We do not anticipate the disposition to have a material impact on future revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized variable lease revenue, including costs paid by the lessor and reimbursed by the lessees within rental revenue of 7.1 million as compared to 7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts are also recognized in property expenses. 
 We recognize rental income on a straight-line basis to include the effect of base rent escalators, and free rent periods, if any. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expense is comprised of costs associated with staff, office rent, legal, accounting, information technology, and other professional services and other administrative services in association with our real estate operations and our REIT structure and reporting requirements. General and administrative expenses increased 911 thousand, or 5.3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in compensation-related expenses and increased non-cash stock compensation expense. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense represents the depreciation on real estate investments that have estimated lives ranging from two to fifty-five years. Depreciation and amortization increased by approximately 3.0 million, or 8.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the acquisition of 48 properties, during the year-over-year period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

 Realized Gain on Sale, Net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not sell any properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold six properties with a combined net book value of 20.6 million for a realized gain on sale of 2.1 million.

 Restaurant Operations 
 Restaurant revenues increased by 141 thousand, or 0.6 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher net pricing, partially offset by city construction projects outside two locations.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of FCPT s consolidated financial statements in conformance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates on assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of FCPT s critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Management believes those critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 New Accounting Standards 
 A discussion of new accounting standards and the possible effects of these standards on our consolidated financial statements is included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Liquidity and Financial Condition 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 44.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 250 million of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, which expires on November 9, 2025, subject to our ability to extend the term for one additional six-month period to May 9, 2026. The revolving credit facility provides for a letter of credit sub-limit of 25 million. See Note 6 - Debt, Net of Deferred Financing Costs included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on the term loans, after consideration of the interest rate hedges, was 3.76 . 
 On March 14, 2024, FCPT entered into an Incremental Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement with a group of existing lenders (the Credit Agreement ). The Company utilized the accordion feature of the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement to enter into a new 85 million term loan (the Term Loan ), the 
 31 

proceeds from which were used to repay the 50 million of senior unsecured notes payable due in June 2024. The Term Loan matures in March 2027 with one twelve month extension exercisable at the Company s option, subject to certain conditions. 
 We have entered into the following interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate variability associated with the term loan portion of our credit facility. These hedging agreements were entered into to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in FCPT OP s variable rate debt and not for trading purposes. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges with all interest income and expense recorded as a component of net income and other valuation changes recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.

(1) In November 2024, the notional amount of the swap will increase to 150 million 

(2) During the first nine months of 2024, we entered into these interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate variability associated with the term loan portion of our credit facility 

The Company also enters into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates from the trade date through the forecasted issuance date of debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company terminated one cash flow hedge in connection with the 85 million Term Loan that was entered into on March 11, 2024 and funded on March 14, 2024. This cash flow hedge had a total notional value of 25 million and was entered into in August 2023 to hedge the interest rate on a future offering or term loan. The swap was terminated on February 28, 2024, with the corresponding asset of 211 thousand which will be amortized over the next 10 years as an increase to interest expense. 
 The Company has issued the following 625 million of senior unsecured fixed rate notes in private placements pursuant to note purchase agreements with the various purchasers.

On September 17, 2024, the Company terminated the prior ATM program and entered into a new ATM program (the "ATM programs"), pursuant to which shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 500.0 million may be offered and sold (1) by the Company to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as its sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at 
 32 

negotiated prices, by privately negotiated transactions (including block sales) or by any other methods permitted by applicable law. The ATM program replaces the Company's previous 450.0 million ATM program (the "prior ATM program" and, together with the ATM program, the "ATM programs"), which was established in November 2022, under which the Company had sold shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of 404.8 million through September 17, 2024. In connection with the Company s ATM programs, the Company may enter into forward sale agreements with certain financial institutions acting as forward purchasers whereby, at the Company's discretion, the forward purchasers may borrow and sell shares of common stock. The use of forward sale agreements allows the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of common stock at the time the respective forward sale agreements are executed but defer settling the forward sale agreements and receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed forward sale agreements with financial institutions acting as forward purchasers under the ATM programs to sell 4,131,747 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of 27.79 per share before sales commissions and offering expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company physically settled a portion of its forward sale agreements and issued 950,000 shares at a gross weighted average sales price of 26.81. After sales commissions and offering expenses, these shares were sold at a net weighted average share price of 26.41 for net proceeds of 25.1 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding forward sale agreement to sell 3,181,747 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of 28.08 before sales commission and offering expenses. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 4,412,272 shares under the ATM programs, including physically settled forward sale agreements, at a gross weighted average share price of 26.74. After sales commissions and offering expenses, these shares were issued at a net weighted average share price of 26.30 for net proceeds of 116.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 4,792,842 shares under the ATM programs, including physically settled forward sale agreements, at a gross weighted average share price of 26.63. After sales commissions and offering expenses, these shares were sold at a net weighted average share price of 26.15 for net proceeds of 125.3 million. 
 The Company did not execute or settle forward sale agreements during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company executed forward sale agreements with financial institutions acting as forward purchasers under the prior ATM program to sell 1,907,946 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of 27.73 per share before sales commissions and offering expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company physically settled its forward sale agreements under the prior ATM program and issued 4,437,970 shares at a gross weighted average share price of 27.32. After sales commissions and offering expenses, these shares were sold at a net weighted average share price of 26.88 for net proceeds of 119.3 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not issue any shares under the prior ATM program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 4,787,970 shares under the prior ATM program, including physically settled forward sale agreements, at a gross weighted average share price of 27.23. After sales commissions and offering expenses, these shares were sold at a net weighted average share price of 26.79 for net proceeds of 128.2 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, there was 483.3 million available for issuance under the ATM programs. 
 On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for operating expenses, distributions to stockholders and interest and principal on current and any future debt financings. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, capital expenditures, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, and, for acquisitions, investments, and other capital expenditures, from borrowings under our 250 million revolving credit facility. 
 On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds include payment of dividends, financing of property acquisitions, and scheduled debt maturities. We plan to meet our long-term capital needs by issuing debt or equity securities or by obtaining asset-level financing, subject to market conditions. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed on an intermediate basis by our revolving credit facility or other indebtedness. In the future, we may also acquire properties by issuing partnership interests of FCPT OP in exchange for property owned by third parties. Our common partnership interests would be redeemable for cash or shares of our common stock, at FCPT s election. 
 We continually evaluate alternative financing and believe that we can obtain financing on reasonable terms. However, we cannot be assured that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us. We expect that our primary uses of capital will be for property and other asset acquisitions and the funding of tenant improvements and other capital expenditures, and debt refinancing. 
 Because the properties in our portfolio are generally leased to tenants under net leases, where the tenant is responsible for property operating costs and expenses, our exposure to rising property operating costs due to inflation is mitigated. Interest rates and other factors, such as occupancy, rental rate and the financial condition of our tenants, influence our performance more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. As described above, we currently offer leases that provide for payments of base rent with scheduled annual fixed increases.

Non-GAAP Definitions 
 The certain non-GAAP financial measures included above management believes are helpful in understanding our business, as further described below. Our definition and calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those of other REITs and therefore may not be comparable. The non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance and should be considered only a supplement to net income, and to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of profitability and/or liquidity, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 FFO is a supplemental measure of our performance which should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash provided by operating activities as a measure of operating performance and liquidity. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and undepreciated land and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We also omit the tax impact of non-FFO producing activities from FFO determined in accordance with the NAREIT definition. 
 Our management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We offer this measure because we recognize that FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. FFO is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a measure of liquidity including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. In addition, our calculations of FFO are not necessarily comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us. Investors in our securities should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP measure, including net income.

Adjusted Funds from Operations is a non-U.S. GAAP measure that is used as a supplemental operating measure specifically for comparing year-over-year ability to fund dividend distribution from operating activities. AFFO is used by us as a basis to address our ability to fund our dividend payments. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO: 
 1. Transaction costs incurred in connection with business combinations 

2. Straight-line rent revenue adjustment 

3. Stock-based compensation expense 

4. Non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs 

5. Other non-cash interest expense (income) 

6. Non-real estate investment depreciation 

7. Merger, restructuring and other related costs 

8. Impairment charges 

9. Other non-cash revenue adjustments, including amortization of above and below market leases and lease incentives 

10. Amortization of capitalized leasing costs 

11. Debt extinguishment gains and losses 

12. Non-cash expense (income) adjustments related to deferred tax benefits 

AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow from operations for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of performance by adjusting the effect of certain items noted above included in FFO. AFFO is a widely reported measure by other REITs; however, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs. 
 Item 3. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Information concerning market risk is incorporated herein by reference to Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by the information under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.
