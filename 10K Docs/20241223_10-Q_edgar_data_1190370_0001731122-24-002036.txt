ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

General 

The following
information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto and in conjunction with Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October
31, 2021. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding future results of operation, made in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. We use words such as expects, believes, intends, and similar expressions to identify
forward-looking statements. Forward looking-looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain.
Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, competition in our cold weather markets, our
ability to sell out House Wrap product line, our inability to secure sufficient funding to maintain and/or expand our current level of
operations and the seasonality of our cold weather product line. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations, are described in greater detail in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise
any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by law.

Revenues
for the nine-month period ended July 31, 2024, were 644,497 compared to revenues of 223,546 for the nine-month period ended July 31,
2024. The increase in revenue is nearly all attributable to an increase in our House Wrap products revenue. 

13 

As of September
27,2024, we have a backlog of approximately 247,00 in orders for our House wrap product line. 

As of August
30, 2024, one of our Distributors has generated approximately 550,000 in sales. 

Cost of sale
and SG A expenses were 725,308 for the nine month period ended July 31, 2024, compared to 466,756 for the nine month period ended
July 31, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the
three-month period ended July 31, 2024, we funded our operations from revenues and the sale of our common stock. 

Short Term:
We will continue to fund our operations from sales and the sale of our securities. We continue to pay our creditors when payments are
due. We will require more funds to be able to order the material for our Insultex products and to purchase equipment needed for the manufacture
of the Insultex product. The Company reached an agreement with the manufacturer of the Insultex material to purchase a machine capable
of producing the Insultex material. Also included in the proposed agreement will be the propriety formula that creates Insultex. The Company
took delivery of the equipment in December 2015. The Company will have to have the machine installed and ensure that it can be operated
in compliance with all environmental rules and regulations. It is the Company intentions to have the equipment operational but cannot
currently provide a time estimate. Among the factors affecting the time estimate are the financial resources available to the Company,
finding a suitable facility and bringing technical personnel from abroad to install the equipment. The Company has currently made deposits
of 652,944 on the equipment. The Company will produce Insultex under its own brand name. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements. 

The new quality
control testing equipment for our House Wrap Product line has been built. We have reached an agreement with the vendor on the final amount.
As of July 31, 2024, we have paid approximately 134,000 in deposits for the equipment. We expect to accept delivery of the equipment
when we are able to reach an agreement with a testing laboratory that will house the equipment. Once the equipment is installed it will
have to go through a certification process before we will be able to conduct tests on our Insultex products. Once the testing equipment
is certified, we intend to begin the process of having Insulted certified by ICC Evaluation Services, LLC ICC-ES ). ICC-ES
certifies, among other items, building materials and products of which our House Wrap falls under. The reason we need to have ICC-ES certification
is that we believe in order to get large orders for House Wrap, ICC-ES certification will be required. The other component part of the
House wrap produced by a third party is ICC-Es certified. Getting ICC-ES certification is costly and time consuming. 

Long Term:
The Company will continue to fund its operations from revenues, borrowings from private parties and the possible sale of our securities.
Should we not be able to rely on the private sources for borrowing and /or increased sales, our operations would be severely affected
as we would not be able to fund our purchase orders to our suppliers for finished goods and our efforts to produce our own IINSULTEX would
be delayed. 

Subsequent
to the period, on September 26, 2024, we appointed a new CEO/CFO. Please see our Form 8-K filed on September 27, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue from product
sales when all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met: pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the services
have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment; and collection of the amount due is reasonable
assured.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDING 

See Note 16 of the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements appearing
elsewhere in this Report. 

ITEM 1A Risk Factors 

See Risk factors set forth in Part I Item 1A of the Company s Annual
report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.Set forth below are additional risk factors. 

Sole Source for Insultex . We rely on a single source for
the Insultex material. We do not believe we could obtain Insultex from any other source. Insultex is manufactured by a company in Indonesia
using proprietary technology Should we not be able to obtain Insultex from this company for any reason we could no longer maintain operations. 

Reliance on Key Personnel . Mr. Gregory Domian is our Executive
Vice-President, Sales and Marketing. Should we lose the services of Mr. Domian our operations would be materially affected.

Item 4 Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable 

ITEM 4T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management has developed and implemented a policy and procedures for reviewing,
on a quarterly basis, our disclosure controls and procedures. During the period ended April 30, 2024,, our principal executive/financial
officer concluded that these controls and procedures were ineffective. At this time, we do not have the financial resources to employ
a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise. Once we have the necessary financial resources, we plan to hire and designate
an individual responsible for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed to remediate the material weakness
by focusing additional attention and resources in our internal accounting functions. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the most recent fiscal quarter, there were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules
13(a)-15 or 15d-15 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. 

Until the Company has the financial resources to employ a financial staff
with accounting and financial expertise, to be able to properly account for internal financial reporting, errors that may have a material
effect on the financial statements have the potential to occur. 

15 

ITEM 5. Other Information 

During the quarter ended July 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a
 rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b-5 trading arrangement as such terms are defined in Item 408(a)
of Regulation S-K.
