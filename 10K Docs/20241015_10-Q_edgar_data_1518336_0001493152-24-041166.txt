On
March 14, 2017, Virtual Learning changed its name to Dream Homes Development Corporation DHDC ). DHDC maintains a
web site at www.dreamhomesltd.com as well as a blog, located at http://blog.dreamhomesltd.com. 

. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, and renewals and betterments are capitalized. 

Costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings result when either: 1) costs are incurred related to certain claims and unapproved change
orders, or 2) the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage-of-completion accounting
method, but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract. Claims occur
when there is a dispute regarding both a change in the scope of work and the price associated with that change. Unapproved change orders
occur when there is a dispute regarding only the price associated with a change in scope of work. For both claims and unapproved change
orders, the Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable and the amounts
can be reliably estimated. 

Change
in Estimates: 

The
Company s estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed and many factors change during a contract performance period
that result in a change to contract profitability. These factors include, but are not limited to, differing site conditions: availability
of skilled contract labor: performance of major material suppliers and subcontractors: on-going subcontractor negotiations and buyout
provisions: unusual weather conditions: changes in the timing of scheduled work: change orders: accuracy of the original bid estimate:
changes in estimated labor productivity and costs based on experience to date: achievement of incentive-based income targets: and the
expected, or actual, resolution terms for claims. The factors that cause changes in estimates vary depending on the maturation of the
project within its lifecycle. For example, in the ramp-up phase, these factors typically consist of revisions in anticipated project
costs and during the peak and close-out phases, these factors include the impact of change orders and claims as well as additional revisions
in remaining anticipated project costs. Generally, if the contract is at an early stage of completion, the current period impact is smaller
than if the same change in estimate is made to the contract at a later stage of completion. Management focuses on evaluating the performance
of contracts individually and uses the cumulative catch-up method to account for revisions in estimates. Material changes in estimates
are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

of age-restricted manufactured housing. The property is currently in the final approval stage. An application was made to the DEP for
a wetlands letter of interpretation, which was approved as proposed. Further action before the planning board is pending due to delays
caused by township closures due to Covid-19. The Company had a virtual workshop meeting on September 15, 2020 and an additional virtual
meeting was conducted on November 17, 2020. 

The
application for a use variance was heard on May 24, 2021 and the variance was approved. 

The
Company applied for preliminary and final site plan approval and was heard at the April 2023 planning board meeting. Preliminary approval
was granted, and the Company submitted for finals in the 4 th quarter of 2023. 

The
Company took title to this property in early September of 2023. It is the Company s intention to develop this property, sell the
individual manufactured homes and continue to own operate the development as a land lease rental property. 

These
new developments which the Company owns represent a significant value in new construction. This work will occur over the next 3-4 years
and is in addition to the custom spot lot elevation/renovation division of the business. Management is very positive about these
new developments, as well as the cutting-edge construction technologies being employed to create healthier, safer, more energy efficient
homes.

ITEM
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called
 forward-looking statements, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. One can identify these forward-looking
statements by their use of words such as expect, plan, will, may, anticipate, 
 believe, estimate, should, intend, forecast, project 
the negative or plural of these words, and other comparable terminology. One can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. statements are likely to address the Company s growth strategy, financial results and product and
development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results
to differ from the Company s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other
risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual
future results may vary materially. The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully
evaluate such statements in light of factors described in the Company s filings with the SEC, especially the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K and the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In various filings the Company has identified important factors
that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. One should understand that it is not possible to predict
or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks
or uncertainties. 

Use
of Terms 

The
following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.
Unless the context indicates or suggests otherwise, reference to we , our , us and the Company 
in this section refers to the operations of Dream Homes Development Corporation (DHDC), 

PLAN
OF OPERATION 

Overview 

Building
on a history of over 2,000 new homes built and over 400 elevation/renovation/addition projects since 1993, the management of Dream Homes
 Development Corporation has positioned the company to emerge as a rapidly growing regional developer of new single-family subdivisions
as well as a leader in coastal new home and modular construction, elevation and mitigation. Since Superstorm Sandy flooded 40,000 owner-occupied
homes, Dream Homes has helped hundreds of homeowners to build new homes or raise their homes to comply with new FEMA requirements. While
other companies involved with coastal construction in Flood Hazard Areas, Dream Homes has excelled. As many of our competitors have failed,
Dream Homes has developed a reputation as the region s most trusted builder and has even become known as the rescue builder 
for homeowners whose projects have been abandoned by others. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in
the FEMA flood maps which now require over 40,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, Dream Homes has capitalized
on this opportunity for continued revenue growth. 

A
new trend in the real estate market which has experienced significant growth in the last year is the emerging Build To Lease trend. This
focus and concentration on building both single and multi-family developments with the intention to lease them immediately upon completion
is being made in response to several factors. One factor is the extreme shortage of rental properties on the market, not only for first
time homemakers, but for retirees, and young professionals who are unclear as to the intentions of settling in one location. The second
factor is the overall lender and funding source preference to lend to Build To Lease developments, as opposed to more traditional Build
To Sell developments due to the perception of Build To Lease as a safer investment over the long term. Finally, the extraordinary amount
of interest from non-traditional sources such as pension and hedge funds, insurance companies and venture capital firms to purchase completed
new For Lease developments at attractive metrics based on capitalization rates has spurred a large growth in this market segment. 

3 

The
Company has made the decision to change focus in their new home developments to better accommodate this growing trend. Currently 2 new
multi-family developments, which represent a total count of 79 units, will be changed from Build For Sale to Build for Lease. The Company
intends to hold these properties upon completion and lease-up for an indeterminate period of time, and realize the rental income from
ownership. This strategy will become a very significant revenue stream for the Company and will become a third division of the Company,
behind custom new homes and renovation/elevation projects. 

Management
recognized that the effects of Super Storm Sandy, which occurred on 10/29/12, would continue to cause a steady demand for construction
services. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in the FEMA flood maps which now require over 40,000
homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, management feels that a continued focus on this portion of the market
will continue to provide a stable revenue stream for the company. 

Dream
Homes and Development Corporation, through its subsidiaries and affiliate companies, continues to pursue opportunities in the real estate
field, specifically in new home construction, home elevations and renovations. 	 

 In
addition to the above projects, which are in process, the Company has also estimated an additional 6,500,000 worth of residential construction
projects and added over 200 active prospects to its data base. All these prospects are prime candidates for educational videos and short
books on specific construction and rebuilding topics, as well as candidates for rebuilding projects. 

In
addition to the projects which the Company currently has under contract for elevation, renovation, new construction and development,
there are a number of parcels of land which the Company has the ability to secure, whether through land contract or other types of options.
These parcels represent additional opportunities for development and construction potential. 

4 

Dream
Homes has experienced solid growth in both the new home and elevation divisions, as well as strong additions to our personnel infrastructure,
which are just now beginning to bear fruit. 

The
Company was awarded the Ocean County Best of the Best Awards repeatedly in several categories (Best Custom Modular Builder and Best Home
Improvement Contractor), and this recognition has created continued and significant new awareness and interest from the public. This
has led to more traffic, completed estimates and signed contracts. Referrals about Dream Homes are also being generated from many industry
professionals, such as architects, engineers and attorneys, who ve either had clients with abandoned projects or simply want to
retain Dream due to superior performance and reliability. 

The
phrase The Region s Most Trusted Builder accurately describes the company and is becoming increasingly well known
to homeowners in need of new homes, elevation renovation work. The management team has never failed to complete a project in over
30 years in the industry. 

The
Company s business model over the last year has been focused on increasing the new home and new development portion of our business,
until it represents 50 - 70 of our entire revenue stream, from the current level of 20 . New home development has a much greater scalability
and growth potential than elevation/renovation work. Though the Company has enjoyed steady growth in the renovation/elevation portion
of the company the new homes division continues to represent a greater percentage of total revenue. 

Management
hopes for steady growth in all segments of the company, since the rebuilding process will occur over the next 15-20 years. The combined
total number of homes affected by Storm Sandy that will need to be raised or demolished and rebuilt is in excess of 30,000 homes, of
which less than 10,000 have been rebuilt. This remaining combined market for new construction and elevation projects in the Company s
market area is estimated to be in the range of 3.4 billion dollars. The company anticipates being able to efficiently address 5 - 10 
of this market. Dream Homes potential operations include the development and sale of a variety of residential communities, including
construction of semi-custom homes, entry-level and first time move-up single-family and multi-family homes. 

Due
to the opportunities afforded by the market conditions, Dream Homes and Development Corporation will continue to pursue opportunities
in the construction and real estate field, specifically in new home construction, home elevations and renovations.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely

Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s President concluded that the Company s

that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
the Company s President, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

The
Company recently had two non-binding arbitration awards assessed against its subsidiary, Shore Custom Homes Corp. Though the Company
considers these lawsuits to be frivolous and without merit, it has chosen to disclose their existence in the interest of full transparency.
In demonstration of its opposition to these awards, the Company has filed for trial de novo in both cases and intends to vigorously defend
its position in court. 

In
addition to the above referenced awards, the Company is involved in several other minor lawsuits in which it also expects to prevail,
The Company considers the substance of these claims to be of no merit. 

The
Company is vigorously defending all lawsuits and fully expects to prevail in court. 

In
the opinion of the Company and of its professional advisors, none of the lawsuits which the Company is currently involved in have any
substantive validity or potential for material consequence to the Company. 

All
other normal operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are continuing with no negative effect from these lawsuits.
