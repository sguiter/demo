ITEM 2 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements, other than purely historical information,
including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements generally are identified
by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, 
 intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will
be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. 

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations
and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could
have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes
in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting
principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should
not be placed on such statements. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash balance is 1,093 as of September 30, 2024.
Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize
funds from Takehiro Abe, our sole Director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating fees, and professional
fees. Takehiro Abe, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order
to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require further funding. Being a start-up stage company, we have
very limited operating history. After a twelve-month period we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements
for such financing. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 141,115
due to the related party of Mr. Takehiro Abe, our sole officer and director. 

We are a start-up company and have generated nominal
revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024. We have to generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs and expenses as the first
priority. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues, long term financing will be required to fully implement our business plan. If we
need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations
entirely. 

Net Loss 

We recorded a net loss of 40,918 for the six months
ended September 30, 2024 as opposed to a net income of 27,826 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss is
attributed to the decrease of revenues. 

Going Concern 

For the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company
has suffered recurring losses from operations, yielded negative cash flows from operations, and had a net capital deficiency. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s management plans to engage
in very limited activities without incurring any liabilities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The
Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain
revenue- producing contracts or financing, or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses
it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances,
acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. These conditions and uncertainties raise substantial
doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

We prepare our unaudited interim financial statements
in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments
on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the interim financial
statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different
amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting
policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our interim financial statements. 

While we believe that the historical experience, current
trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could
differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. 

ITEM 3 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4 
 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report were ineffective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

Material weaknesses noted were: lack of a functioning
audit committee; lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives affecting
authorization, recordkeeping, custody of assets, and reconciliations; and, management is dominated by a single individual/small group
without adequate compensating controls. 

Management believes that the material weaknesses set
forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee
and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements
in future periods. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no significant changes to the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected,
or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
