 Regulatory Matters 
 
 Rhode Island Activities (PPL) 
 
 Rate Case Proceedings 
 
 Pursuant to Report and Order No. 23823 issued May 5, 2020, the RIPUC approved the terms of an Amended Settlement Agreement (the ASA), reflecting an allowed return on equity (ROE) rate of based on a common equity ratio of approximately . RIE is currently in year six of the multi-year rate plan (Rate Plan). On June 30, 2021, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers consented to an open-ended extension of the term of the Rate Plan. Pursuant to the settlement with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General in connection with the acquisition of RIE by PPL, RIE currently does not anticipate filing a new base rate case before October 1, 2025. Pursuant to the open-ended extension, the Rate Year 3 level of base distribution rates under the ASA will remain in effect and RIE will continue to operate under the current Rate Plan until a new Rate Plan is approved by the RIPUC. 
 
 The ASA includes additional provisions, including (i) an Electric Transportation Initiative (the ET Initiative) to facilitate the growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and scaling of the market for EV charging equipment to advance Rhode Island's zero emission vehicles and greenhouse gas emissions policy goals, (ii) two energy storage demonstration projects, which are online and fully connected, (iii) a performance incentive for System Efficiency: Annual Megawatt Capacity Savings, which sunset in 2021 and is a tracking and reporting only metric, and (iv) several additional metrics for tracking and reporting purposes only. The RIPUC discussed the ET Initiative at an Open Meeting on August 30, 2022, advising RIE to seek RIPUC authorization to continue the ET Initiative and/or to alter any of the targets established in the ASA for Rate Year 5 and beyond. No votes or official rulings were taken; however, based on this feedback, RIE paused the ET programs in Rate Year 5.

 million, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations with respect to the potential offsets and recoverability of certain costs. RIE is required to continue spending, even if above the recovery cap, until it achieves the functionalities outlined in the AMF Business Case. RIE filed with the RIPUC for approval (i) an updated electric Service Quality Plan on December 27, 2023, (ii) additional compliance tariff provisions regarding recovery and updated cost schedules to reflect the RIPUC's decision on December 22, 2023, and (iii) electric and gas tariff advice filings for Automatic Meter Reading/AMF meter opt-out tariff provisions on September 19, 2024. RIE cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
 
 Grid Modernization 
 
 RIE filed a new GMP with the RIPUC on December 30, 2022. The new GMP filing consists of a holistic suite of grid modernization investments that will provide RIE with the tools and capability to manage the electric distribution system more granularly considering a range of distributed energy resources adoption levels, accelerated by Rhode Island's climate mandates, while at the same time maintaining a safe and reliable electric distribution system. The GMP is an informational guidance document that supports the grid modernization investments to be proposed in future electric ISR plans. Consequently, RIE did not request approval from the RIPUC for any specific investments or seek cost recovery as part of the GMP; rather, RIE requested that the RIPUC issues an order affirming RIE's compliance with its obligation to file a GMP that meets the requirements of the ASA. The RIPUC held a status conference on October 26, 2023 to discuss the scope of the RIPUC's review of the GMP and its potential impact on future electric ISR plans. RIE cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Petition for Deferral of Credit Card Fees 
 
 On January 31, 2024, RIE filed a petition with the RIPUC requesting authority to recognize regulatory assets related to credit card, debit card and related fees transactions ("Electronic Transaction Fees") that RIE has waived and will continue to waive pursuant to the RIPUC orders related to COVID-19 impacts. On July 30, 2024, the RIPUC unanimously approved RIE's request to record a regulatory asset for Electronic Transaction Fees that have been incurred since July 1, 2020 until RIE's next general rate case or as otherwise determined by the RIPUC. RIE plans to include a proposal as part of its next base distribution rate case for the amortization and recovery of the regulatory assets and to include future Electronic Transaction Fees in base distribution rates. 
 
 On January 31, 2024, RIE also filed a Notice of Withdrawal of its April 2021 petition to create regulatory assets for COVID-19 related bad debt expense and the lost revenue from unassessed late payment charges. RIE is continuing to evaluate these other COVID-19 related costs and intends to reserve its rights to file for recovery of these costs in the future. RIE cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 FY 2023 Gas Infrastructure, Safety and Reliability (ISR) Plan 
 
 At an Open Meeting on March 29, 2022, the RIPUC conditionally approved RIE's FY 2023 Gas ISR Plan and associated revenue requirement, subject to further review regarding RIE's Proactive Main Replacement Program and its decision to reconstruct and purchase heating and pressure regulation equipment located at RIE's Wampanoag and Tiverton take stations. In response to RIPUC direction, RIE filed testimony with the RIPUC on May 16, 2022 regarding its replacement of heating and pressure regulation facilities at the Wampanoag and Tiverton take stations and addressing: (i) a cost-benefit analysis arising from RIE's decision to take ownership of the reconstructed take station equipment; (ii) the potential that the benefits derived from the reconstruction and ownership transfer of the take station equipment will not be realized due to the future use of hydrogen or abandonment of the gas system; and (iii) the depreciation and accounting treatment of the reconstructed take station equipment. T he RIPUC has not taken any action to date on this issue, including in its action on the FY 2025 Gas ISR Plan.

 KPSC Investigation Related to Winter Storm Elliott 
 
 On December 22, 2023, the KPSC initiated an investigation into the practices of LG E and KU regarding the provision of electric service from December 23, 2022 through December 25, 2022, during a period of extreme temperatures during Winter Storm Elliott. The investigation is the result of LG E's and KU's need to implement brief service interruptions to approximately 55,000 customers during this period. The purpose of the investigation is to supplement discovery and examination already completed through LG E's and KU's CPCN proceedings, a legislative hearing completed in February 2023 and reports completed by the NERC and the FERC related to the issue. Additionally, the investigation will evaluate LG E's and KU's actions taken, or planned to be taken, since Winter Storm Elliott that affect their ability to provide service during periods of variable weather and power system stress. LG E and KU believe actions taken during the period under question were necessary and appropriate. Several parties were granted intervenor status for the proceeding and, after completion of written discovery, a hearing on the matter occurred on May 23, 2024. The parties have filed post-hearing briefs and the case has been submitted for decision. LG E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and an estimate of the impact, if any, cannot be determined, but LG E and KU do not believe this matter will have a significant impact on their operations or financial condition.

The KPSC intends to rule on the matter by February 28, 2025. LG E cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
 
 Pennsylvania Activities (PPL and PPL Electric) 
 
 PAPUC investigation into billing issues 
 
 On January 31, 2023, the PAPUC initiated an investigation focused on billing issues related to estimated, irregular bills and customer service concerns following customer complaints, which for many customers were driven by increased prices for electricity supply. Certain bills issued during the time period of December 20, 2022 through January 9, 2023 were estimated due to a technical issue that prevented PPL Electric from providing actual collected meter data to customer facing and other internal systems. Customers also reported difficulties accessing PPL Electric's website and contacting the customer service call center. The PAPUC's Bureau of Investigation Enforcement (I E) has directed PPL Electric to respond to certain inquiries and document requests. PPL Electric submitted its responses to the information request and cooperated fully with the investigation. PPL Electric reached a Settlement Agreement with I E on November 21, 2023. In the settlement, PPL Electric agreed to pay a civil penalty of million, make certain remedial improvements to its billing systems and processes, and agreed to not seek recovery for extraordinary costs incurred in responding to or resulting from the billing event. On November 21, 2023, PPL Electric and I E submitted a Joint Petition for Approval of Settlement to the PAPUC. On January 18, 2024, the PAPUC issued an Order requesting public comment prior to the PAPUC entering a Final Order on the petition. Comments were due on February 28, 2024, and comments were filed by the Office of Consumer Advocate, CAUSE-PA (low-income advocate), and individual customers. On March 19, 2024, PPL Electric filed reply comments. On April 25, 2024, the PAPUC announced at its public meeting that it would be issuing an order approving the Settlement Agreement with modifications. The modifications

 million civil penalty to a million donation to PPL Electric's hardship fund, Operation HELP, and requiring PPL Electric to make various progress reports on efforts to remediate the billing issue. PPL Electric and I E had 20 business days from the issuance of the PAPUC order to accept or reject the proposed modifications to the Settlement Agreement. The time period to withdraw from the Settlement Agreement expired on June 14, 2024, without PPL Electric or I E withdrawing from the Settlement Agreement, and the terms of the Settlement Agreement, as modified by the PAPUC's order, are now final. PPL Electric is in the process of complying with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, including making the million contribution to Operation HELP on June 24, 2024. 
 
 PPL Electric incurred costs and million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and million and million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 related to the billing issue. PPL Electric will not seek regulatory recovery of these costs. 
 
 DSIC Petition 
 
 On April 26, 2024, PPL Electric filed a Petition with the PAPUC requesting that the PAPUC waive PPL Electric's DSIC cap of of billed revenues and increase the maximum allowable DSIC to for bills rendered on or after January 1, 2025. The publicly available procedural and litigation schedule currently contemplates that the PAPUC would issue a final order at its January 23, 2025 Public Meeting. PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Act 129 
 
 The Pennsylvania Public Utility Code requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, to act as a DSP, which provides electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PAPUC-approved default service procurement plan. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan. 
 
 In March 2024, PPL Electric filed a Petition for Approval of a new default service program and procurement plan with the PAPUC for the period June 1, 2025 through May 31, 2029. In August 2024, PPL Electric submitted a Joint Petition for Settlement in the proceeding. In September 2024, the Administrative Law Judge issued an Interim Order approving the proposed settlement without modification which remains pending before the PAPUC. PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
 
 Federal Matters 
 
 FERC Transmission Rate Filing (PPL, LG E and KU) 
 
 In 2018, LG E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going waivers and credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals - D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals) regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. On May 18, 2023, the FERC issued an order on remand reversing its 2019 decision and requiring LG E and KU to refund credits previously withheld, including under such transition mechanism. LG E and KU filed a petition for review of the FERC's May 18, 2023 order with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and provided refunds in accordance with the FERC order on December 1, 2023. The FERC issued an order on LG E's and KU's compliance filing on November 16, 2023, and LG E and KU filed a petition for review of this November 16, 2023 order on February 14, 2024. FERC issued the substantive order on rehearing on March 21, 2024, reaffirming its prior decision. LG E and KU filed their opening brief with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on June 24, 2024 and the FERC and the intervenors have filed briefs as well. LG E's and KU's reply brief is due November 4, 2024. LG E and KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or any other post decision process but do not expect the annual impact to have a material effect on their operations or financial condition. LG E and KU currently receive recovery of certain waivers and credits primarily through base rates increases, provided, however, that increases associated with the FERC's May 18, 2023 order are expected to be subject to future rate proceedings.

 The ROE for transmission rates under the ISO-NE OATT is the subject of four complaints that are pending before the FERC. On October 16, 2014, the FERC issued an order on the first complaint, Opinion No. 531-A, resetting the base ROE applicable to transmission assets under the ISO-NE OATT from to effective as of October 16, 2014 and establishing a maximum ROE of . On April 14, 2017, this order was vacated and remanded by the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Court of Appeals). After the remand, the FERC issued an order on October 16, 2018 applicable to all four pending cases where it proposed a new base ROE methodology that, with subsequent input and support from the New England Transmission Owners (NETO), yielded a base ROE of . Subsequent to the FERC's October 2018 order in the NETO cases, the FERC further refined its ROE methodology in another proceeding and has applied that refined methodology to transmission owners' ROEs in other jurisdictions, and the NETOs filed further information in the New England matters to distinguish their case. The proceeding and the final base rate ROE determination in the New England matters remain open, pending a final order from the FERC. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and an estimate of the impact cannot be determined.

 Narragansett Electric Litigation (PPL) 
 
 Energy Efficiency Programs Investigation 
 
 Narragansett Electric, while under the ownership of National Grid, performed an internal investigation into conduct associated with its energy efficiency programs. On June 27, 2022, the RIPUC opened a new docket (RIPUC Docket No. 22-05-EE) to investigate RIE s actions and the actions of employees of National Grid USA and affiliates during the time RIE was a National Grid USA affiliate being provided services by National Grid USA Service Company, Inc. relating to the manipulation of the reporting of invoices affecting the calculation of past energy efficiency shareholder incentives and the resulting impact on customers. The Rhode Island Attorney General and National Grid USA intervened in the docket. 
 
 On January 19, 2023, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (the Division) filed a motion to dismiss RIPUC Docket No. 22-05-EE without prejudice. As grounds for its motion, the Division stated that sufficient evidence exists in the docket to warrant an independent summary investigation by the Division, to include an audit of RIE. If the Division finds sufficient grounds, the Division may proceed to a formal hearing regarding the matters under investigation. Upon the conclusion of its investigation, the Division will provide the RIPUC with a report outlining the Division s findings and final decision. On January 30, 2023, the Rhode Island Attorney General filed an objection to the Division s motion to dismiss; RIE and National Grid USA each filed responses with the RIPUC requesting that any additional action taken by the RIPUC or the Division be considered after National Grid USA completes its internal investigation report, which National Grid USA filed with the RIPUC on March 10, 2023. On February 24, 2023, the Division initiated the independent summary investigation that it had referenced in its motion to dismiss. The RIPUC held a hearing on March 28, 2023 to hear oral arguments regarding the Division s motion to dismiss and subsequently denied the motion. On November 27, 2023, the Division filed testimony recommending the RIPUC disallow a portion of the performance incentive awarded from 2012 through 2021. On January 19, 2024, the Division and the Rhode Island Attorney General filed their respective briefs recommending that the RIPUC assess financial penalties on the Company. The Division also recommended that the RIPUC consider further regulatory investigations and analysis within each of the energy efficiency dockets from 2012 through 2020, to confirm the accuracy of claimed savings and to document all conduct and actions that would trigger penalties. On April 2, 2024, the RIPUC issued an amended order that expressly expands the scope of the proceeding to address issues of accountability and the question of whether statutory penalties should be assessed against RIE relating to the manipulation of the reporting of invoices affecting the recovery of past shareholder incentives and the resulting impact on RIE s customers. This RIPUC proceeding remains open and, in parallel, the Division s summary investigation remains ongoing. In the RIPUC proceeding, RIE and National Grid USA filed testimony on June 14, 2024, supporting their position that the appropriate amount to be refunded to the energy efficiency program is less than 1 million. The Division s current position is that million is the appropriate amount to be refunded to the energy efficiency program. The Division s testimony on statutory penalties was due October 15, 2024. On October 14, 2024, the Division filed a motion to suspend the procedural schedule and requirement for filing testimony. At this time, it is not possible to predict the final outcome, or determine the total amount of any additional liabilities that may be incurred by RIE in connection with this matter or the Division s summary investigation. RIE does not expect this matter will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 
 E.W. Brown Environmental Assessment PPL and KU) 
 
 KU is undertaking extensive remedial measures at the E.W. Brown plant including closure of the former ash pond, implementation of a groundwater remedial action plan and performance of a corrective action plan including aquatic study of adjacent surface waters and risk assessment. The aquatic study and risk assessment are being undertaken pursuant to a 2017 agreed Order with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). KU conducted sampling of Herrington Lake in 2017 and 2018. In June 2019, KU submitted to the KEEC the required aquatic study and risk assessment, conducted by an independent third-party consultant, finding that discharges from the E.W. Brown plant have not had any significant impact on Herrington Lake and that the water in the lake is safe for recreational use and meets safe drinking water standards. On May 31,

 2021, the KEEC approved the report and released a response to public comments. On August 6, 2021, KU submitted a Supplemental Remedial Alternatives Analysis report to the KEEC that outlines proposed additional fish, water, and sediment testing. On February 18, 2022, the KEEC provided approval to KU to proceed with the proposed sampling, which commenced in the spring of 2022. On November 17, 2022, KU submitted a Supplemental Performance Monitoring Report to the KEEC finding that there are no significant unaddressed risks to human health or the environment at the plant. KU revised the Supplemental Performance Monitoring Report on June 8, 2023, in response to KEEC comments from April 24, 2023. On September 1, 2023, the KEEC requested KU to propose additional monitoring or remedial measures. KU submitted a revised Supplemental Performance Monitoring and Corrective Action Completion on December 28, 2023. In August 2024, KU submitted a proposed environmental covenant to the KEEC specifying certain site restrictions. Discussions between KU and the KEEC are ongoing. 
 
 Water/Waste (PPL, LG E and KU) 
 
 ELGs 
 
 In 2015, the EPA finalized ELGs for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electricity generating facilities. These guidelines require deployment of additional control technologies providing physical, chemical and biological treatment and mandate operational changes including "zero discharge" requirements for certain wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations was to be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis according to criteria provided by the EPA. In September 2017, the EPA issued a rule to postpone the compliance date for certain requirements. In October 2020, the EPA issued revisions to its best available technology standards for certain wastewaters and potential extensions to compliance dates (the Reconsideration Rule). On May 9, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule modifying the 2020 ELG revisions. The rule increases the stringency of previous control technology and zero discharge requirements, revises certain exemptions for generating units planned for retirement, and requires case-by-case limitations for legacy wastewaters based on the best professional judgment of the state regulators. Legal challenges to the final rule have been consolidated before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The final rule is currently under evaluation by PPL, LG E, and KU, but could potentially result in significant operational changes and additional controls for LG E and KU plants. The ELGs are expected to be implemented by the states or applicable permitting authorities in the course of their normal permitting activities. Certain costs are included in the Registrants' capital plans and expected to be recovered from customers through rate recovery mechanisms, but additional costs and recovery will depend on further regulatory developments at the state level. 
 
 CCRs 
 
 In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule governing management of CCRs which include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes (2015 CCR Rule). The 2015 CCR Rule imposed extensive new requirements for certain CCR impoundments and landfills, including public notifications, location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements, and specifies restrictions relating to the beneficial use of CCRs. In January 2022, the EPA issued several proposed regulatory determinations, facility notifications, and public announcements which indicate increased scrutiny by the EPA to determine the adequacy of measures taken by facility owners and operators to achieve closure of CCR surface impoundments and landfills. In particular, the agency indicated that it will focus on certain practices which it views as posing a threat of continuing groundwater contamination. On May 8, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule (2024 CCR Rule) establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at inactive electricity generation facilities (legacy impoundments). The 2024 CCR Rule also establishes identification, groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure care requirements for all CCR management units, as defined in the rule, at regulated CCR facilities regardless of how or when the CCR was placed. The rule also requires LG E and KU to complete applicability determinations, implement site security measures, initiate weekly inspections and monthly monitoring of the impoundment, create a website, and complete hazard assessments and reports for its legacy impoundments. Additionally, the rule could potentially subject CCR management units that have previously completed remedial action and closure and certain beneficial use projects to additional federal regulatory requirements. Legal challenges to the rule have been filed in the D.C. Circuit Court. 
 
 In connection with the 2015 CCR Rule, LG E and KU recorded adjustments to existing AROs beginning in 2015. In connection with the 2024 CCR Rule, in the second quarter of 2024, LG E and KU recognized ARO obligations related to preliminary risk assessments, facility evaluations, feasibility studies and sampling. See Note 15 for additional information. The results of those evaluations, as well as future guidance, regulatory determinations, rulemakings, implementation determinations and other developments could potentially require revisions to current LG E and KU compliance plans including additional monitoring and remediation at surface impoundments and landfills, the cost of which could be material. PPL, LG E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation, rulemaking, and regulatory determinations or potential impacts on

Table of Cont en ts 

 current LG E and KU compliance plans. PPL, LG E and KU are currently finalizing or revising closure plans and schedules in accordance with applicable regulations and further material changes to AROs, current capital plans or operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results, and regulatory or legal proceedings. Costs relating to this rule are expected to be subject to rate recovery. 
 
 LG E and KU received KPSC approval for a compliance plan associated with the 2015 CCR Rule providing for the closure of impoundments at the Mill Creek, Trimble County, E.W. Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition to the foregoing measures required for compliance with the federal CCR Rule, KU also received KPSC approval for its plans to close impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law. LG E and KU have completed planned closure measures at most of the subject impoundments and have commenced post closure groundwater monitoring as required at those facilities. LG E and KU generally expect to complete all impoundment closures within five years of commencement, although a longer period may be required to complete closure of some facilities. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. 
 
 Superfund and Other Remediation 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 The Registrants are potentially responsible for investigating and remediating contamination under the federal Superfund program and similar state programs. Actions are under way at certain sites including former manufactured gas plants in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Kentucky previously owned or operated by, or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of, PPL subsidiaries. 
 
 Depending on the outcome of investigations at identified sites where investigations have not begun or been completed, or developments at sites for which information is incomplete, additional costs of remediation could be incurred. PPL, PPL Electric, LG E and KU lack sufficient information about such additional sites to estimate any potential liability or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these sites. Such costs, however, are not currently expected to be significant. 
 
 The EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of manufactured gas plant operations. As a result, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup, that could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former manufactured gas plants. The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these matters. 
 
 (PPL and PPL Electric) 
 
 PPL Electric is a potentially responsible party for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites. Cleanup actions have been or are being undertaken at these sites as requested by governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL Electric. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PPL Electric had a recorded liability of million, representing its best estimate of the probable loss incurred to remediate these sites. 
 
 (PPL) 
 
 RIE is a potentially responsible party for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites including former manufactured gas plant facilities formerly owned by the Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Company and the Rhode Island gas distribution assets of the New England Gas division of Southern Union Company and electric operations at certain RIE facilities. RIE is currently investigating and remediating, as necessary, those sites and certain other properties under agreements with governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PPL had a recorded liability of million, representing its best estimate of the remaining costs of RIE's environmental remediation activities. These undiscounted costs are expected to be incurred over approximately years and generally to be subject to rate recovery. However, remediation costs for each site may be materially higher than estimated, depending on changing technologies and regulatory standards, selected end uses for each site, and actual environmental conditions encountered. RIE has recovered amounts from certain insurers and potentially responsible parties, and, where appropriate, may seek additional recovery from other insurers and potentially responsible parties, but it is uncertain whether, and to what extent, such efforts will be successful. 
 
 47 

Table of Cont en ts 

 The RIPUC has approved two settlement agreements that provide for rate recovery of qualified remediation costs of certain contaminated sites located in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Rate-recoverable contributions for electric operations of approximately million are added annually to RIE's Environmental Response Fund, established with RIPUC approval in March 2000 to address such costs, along with interest and any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties. In addition, RIE recovers approximately million annually for gas operations under a distribution adjustment charge in which the qualified remediation costs are amortized over years. See Note 6 for additional information on RIE's recorded environmental regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Regulatory Issues 
 
 All Registrants) 
 
 See Note 6 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation. 
 
 Electricity - Reliability Standards 
 
 The NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk electric system in North America. The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards. 
 
 The Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk electric system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties for certain violations. 
 
 PPL Electric, LG E, KU and RIE monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and self-report or self-log potential violations of applicable reliability requirements whenever identified, and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Penalties incurred to date have not been significant. Any Regional Reliability Entity determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC. 
 
 In the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time. The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and an estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined. 
 
 Gas - Security Directives (PPL and LG E) 
 
 In May and July of 2021, the Department of Homeland Security s (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released two security directives applicable to certain notified owners and operators of natural gas pipeline facilities (including local distribution companies) that the TSA has determined to be critical. The TSA has determined that LG E is within the scope of the directive, while RIE has not been notified of this distinction. The first security directive required notified owners/operators to implement cybersecurity incident reporting to the DHS, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, and perform a gap assessment of current entity cybersecurity practices against certain voluntary TSA security guidelines and report relevant results and proposed mitigation to applicable DHS agencies. The second security directive, revised in July of 2024, requires refinement of the cybersecurity implementation plan and the cybersecurity assessment plan. LG E does not believe the security directives have had or will have a significant impact on LG E s operations or financial condition. 
 
 Other 
 
 Guarantees and Other Assurances 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Examples of such agreements include: guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage.

 PPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities and loan obligations of PPL Capital Funding. 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 "Exposure" represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee. The Registrants believe the probability of expected payment/performance under each of these guarantees is remote, except for the guarantees and indemnifications related to the sale of Safari Holdings, which PPL believes are reasonably possible but not probable of occurring. For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the guarantees of PPL include the guarantees of its subsidiary Registrants. 
 (a) 2028 PPL guarantee of Safari payment obligations under certain sale/leaseback financing transactions related to the sale of Safari Holdings (b) 2028 Indemnifications for losses suffered related to items not covered by Aspen Power's representation and warranty insurance associated with the sale of Safari Holdings (c) 2028 LG E and KU LG E and KU obligation of shortfall related to OVEC (d) 
 
 (a) PPL WPD Limited, a PPL indirect U.K. subsidiary, entered into a Tax Deed dated June 9, 2021, in which it agreed to a tax indemnity regarding certain potential tax liabilities of the entities sold with respect to periods prior to the completion of the sale, subject to customary exclusions and limitations. Because National Grid Holdings One plc, the buyer, agreed to purchase indemnity insurance, the amount of the cap on the indemnity for these liabilities is 1, except with respect to certain surrenders of tax losses, for which the amount of the cap on the indemnity is million. 
 (b) PPL guaranteed the payment obligations of Safari under certain sale/leaseback financing transactions executed by Safari. These guarantees will remain in place until Safari exercises its option to buy-out the projects under the sale/leaseback financings by the year 2028. Safari will indemnify PPL for any payments made by PPL or claims against PPL under the sale/leaseback transaction guarantees up to million. 
 (c) Aspen Power has obtained representation and warranty insurance, therefore, PPL generally has no liability for its representations and warranties under the agreement except for losses suffered related to items not covered. Pursuant to the agreement, expiration of these indemnifications range from 18 months to 6 years from the date of the closing of the transaction, and PPL s aggregate liability for these claims will not exceed million, pursuant to the agreement, subject to certain adjustments plus the support obligations provided by PPL under sale-leaseback financings. 
 (d) Pursuant to the OVEC power purchase contract, LG E and KU are obligated to pay for their share of OVEC's excess debt service, post-retirement, and decommissioning costs, as well as any shortfall from amounts included within a demand charge designed and expected to cover these costs over the term of the contract. PPL's proportionate share of OVEC's outstanding debt was million at September 30, 2024, consisting of LG E's share of million and KU's share of million. . See "Energy Purchase Commitments" in Note 13 in PPL's, LG E's and KU's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the OVEC power purchase contract. 
 
 The Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is generally remote. 
 
 PPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. The coverage provides maximum aggregate coverage of million. This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements.

 CEP Reserves maintains a million revolving line of credit with a PPL Electric subsidiary. At September 30, 2024, CEP Reserves had million of borrowings outstanding. At December 31, 2023, CEP Reserves had borrowings outstanding. The interest rates on borrowings are equal to an adjusted one-month SOFR plus a spread. Interest income is reflected in "Interest Income from Affiliate" on the PPL Electric Income Statements.

In 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. The funds are invested primarily in commingled debt and equity funds measured at NAV and are classified as investments in equity securities. Changes in the fair value of the funds are recorded to the Statements of Income. 
 
 Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps PPL, LG E and KU) 
 
 To manage interest rate risk, PPL, LG E and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., SOFR and government security rates), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level 3. 
 
 Gas Contracts (PPL) 
 
 To manage gas commodity price risk associated with natural gas purchases, RIE utilizes over-the-counter (OTC) gas swaps contracts with pricing inputs obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), except in cases where the ICE publishes seasonal averages or where there were no transactions within the last seven

 See "Offsetting Derivative Instruments" below for a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 PPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges (PPL) 
 
 Interest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL had no such contracts at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PPL had cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the amount of accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months is insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded. 
 
 Economic Activity (PPL and LG E) 
 
 LG E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments. Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including terminated swap contracts, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized in "Interest Expense" on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At September 30, 2024, LG E held contracts with a notional amount of million that mature in 2033.

NPNS contracts include certain full requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair values of LG E's interest rate swaps and certain RIE commodity gas contracts that are recognized as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.

 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 
 Certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features which, when in a net liability position, would permit the counterparties to require the transfer of additional collateral upon a decrease in the credit ratings of PPL, LG E and KU or certain of their subsidiaries. Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade. In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. 
 
 Additionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL's, LG E's and KU's obligations under the contracts. A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity. This would typically involve negotiations among the parties. However, such amounts would represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with "adequate assurance" features. 
 
 (PPL) 
 
 At September 30, 2024, derivative contracts in a net liability position that contain credit risk-related contingent features was million. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate fair value of additional collateral requirements in the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade was million.

 costs, certain unallocated costs and certain non-recoverable costs incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of Narragansett Electric. 

Business Strategy 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 PPL operates four regulated utilities located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Rhode Island. Each of these jurisdictions has distinct regulatory structures and each of the utilities has distinct customer classes. 
 
 PPL's strategy, which is supported by the other Registrants and subsidiaries, is to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency; to advance a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability; to maintain a strong financial foundation and create long-term value for our shareowners; to foster a diverse and exceptional workplace; and to build strong communities in areas that we serve. 
 
 Central to PPL's and the other Registrants' strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, in addition to FERC formula rates, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Pennsylvania, FERC formula rates, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Rhode Island, FERC formula rates, the gas cost adjustment, net metering, infrastructure, safety and reliability (ISR) and revenue decoupling mechanisms and other rate adjustment mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. 

Financial and Operational Developments 
 
 RIE Transition Services Agreement Completion PPL) 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of RIE in 2022, National Grid USA and Narragansett Electric entered into a transition services agreement (TSA), pursuant to which the National Grid entities agreed to provide certain transition services to Narragansett Electric to facilitate the transition of the operation of Narragansett Electric to PPL following the acquisition. The TSA was for an initial two-year term and was completed in the third quarter of 2024. TSA costs were million and million during the three and nine months ended , and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Transfer of Certain Credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (PPL) 
 
 The IRS released the final Internal Revenue Code Section 6418 regulations related to the transfer of certain credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. The regulations became effective on July 1, 2024 and did not and are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements regarding prior or future credit transfers. 
 
 Regulatory Requirements 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 The Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 (PPL, LG E and KU) 
 
 Environmental Considerations for Coal-Fired Generation 
 
 The businesses of LG E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See Notes 6, 10 and 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other environmental requirements led PPL, LG E and KU to retire approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky since 2010 . As part of the long-term generation planning 
 66 

Table of Cont en ts 

 process, LG E and KU evaluate a range of factors including the impact of potential stricter environmental regulations, fuel price scenarios, the cost and availability of replacement generation, continued operations and major maintenance costs and the risk of major equipment failures in determining when to retire generation assets. 
 
 As a result of environmental requirements and aging infrastructure, LG E has sought and obtained approval to retire two older coal-fired units at the Mill Creek Plant. Mill Creek Unit 1, with 300 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2, with 297 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2027, subject to certain conditions. 
 
 On October 4, 2024, LG E submitted an application related to the expected retirement of Mill Creek Unit 1 by December 31, 2024, requesting recovery of associated costs under the Retired Asset Recovery (RAR) rider. On October 28, 2024, the KPSC issued an order to establish a procedural schedule regarding its investigation of the reasonableness of the proposed tariff. The KPSC intends to rule on the matter by February 28, 2025. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the Mill Creek Unit 1 RAR rider application. 
 
 FERC Transmission Rate Filing 
 
 In 2018, LG E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going waivers and credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals - D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals) regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. On May 18, 2023, the FERC issued an order on remand reversing its 2019 decision and requiring LG E and KU to refund credits previously withheld, including under such transition mechanism. LG E and KU filed a petition for review of the FERC's May 18, 2023 order with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and provided refunds in accordance with the FERC order on December 1, 2023. The FERC issued an order on LG E's and KU's compliance filing on November 16, 2023, and LG E and KU filed a petition for review of this November 16, 2023 order on February 14, 2024. FERC issued the substantive order on rehearing on March 21, 2024, reaffirming its prior decision. LG E and KU filed their opening brief with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on June 24, 2024 and the FERC and the intervenors have filed briefs as well. LG E's and KU's reply brief is due November 4, 2024. LG E and KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or any other post decision process but do not expect the annual impact to have a material effect on their operations or financial condition. LG E and KU currently receive recovery of certain waivers and credits primarily through base rates increases, provided, however, that increases associated with the FERC's May 18, 2023 order are expected to be subject to future rate proceedings. 
 
 (PPL) 
 
 FY 2025 Gas ISR Plan 
 
 On December 22, 2023, RIE filed its FY 2025 Gas ISR Plan with the RIPUC with a budget that includes 185 million of capital investment spend, plus up to an additional 11 million of contingency plan spend in light of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's potential enactment of regulations during FY 2025 that, if enacted, would significantly alter RIE's leak detection and repair obligations under such regulations. RIE also filed its proposed gas ISR plan budgetary and reconciliation framework, addressing issues raised in connection with its FY 2024 submission, with its FY 2025 ISR Plan. The RIPUC held hearings in March 2024, and on March 26, 2024, approved the plan, including the proposed budgetary and reconciliation framework, with a total approved FY 2025 Gas ISR Plan of 180 million of which 168 million is for capital investment spend and 12 million spend for paving costs as operations and maintenance (O M), p lus the potential additional 11 million available if the above-mentioned regulations are implemented by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. On March 28, 2024, the RIPUC approved RIE's compliance filing for rates effective April 1, 2024.

 FY 2025 Electric ISR Plan 
 
 On December 21, 2023, RIE filed its FY 2025 Electric ISR Plan with the RIPUC with a budget that includes 141 million of capital investment spend, 13 million of vegetation O M spend and 1 million of Other O M spend. RIE also filed its proposed electric ISR plan budgetary and reconciliation framework, addressing issues raised in connection with its FY 2024 submission, with its FY 2025 ISR Plan. The RIPUC held hearings in March 2024, and on March 26, 2024, approved the plan, including the proposed budgetary and reconciliation framework, with modifications to the proposed capital investment spend, resulting in a total approved FY 2025 Electric ISR Plan of 132 million for capital investment spend, 13 million for vegetation management O M spend, and 1 million for Other O M spend. On March 28, 2024, the RIPUC approved RIE's compliance filing for rates effective April 1, 2024. 
 
 Advanced Metering Functionality (AMF) 
 
 In 2021, RIE filed its Updated AMF Business Case and Grid Modernization Plan (GMP) with the RIPUC in accordance with the ASA approved by the RIPUC in August 2018, and which, among other things, sought approval to deploy smart meters throughout the service territory. After PPL completed the acquisition of RIE, RIE filed a new AMF Business Case with the RIPUC in 2022, consisting of a detailed proposal for full-scale deployment of AMF across its electric service territory. 
 
 On September 27, 2023, the RIPUC unanimously approved RIE to deploy an AMF-based metering system for the electric distribution business. RIE is authorized to seek recovery of the approved capital investment through the ISR process with an overall multi-year cap on recovery at approximately 153 million, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations with respect to the potential offsets and recoverability of certain costs. RIE is required to continue spending, even if above the recovery cap, until it achieves the functionalities outlined in the AMF Business Case. RIE filed with the RIPUC for approval (i) an updated electric Service Quality Plan on December 27, 2023, (ii) additional compliance tariff provisions regarding recovery and updated cost schedules to reflect the RIPUC's decision on December 22, 2023, and (iii) electric and gas tariff advice filings for Automatic Meter Reading/AMF meter opt-out tariff provisions on September 19, 2024. RIE cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
 
 Rate Case Proceedings (KU) 
 
 On April 30, 2024, KU filed a request with the VSCC for an annual increase in Virginia base electricity rates of approximately 9 million. KU's request is based on an authorized 10.5 return on equity. Subject to regulatory review and approval, new rates would become effective February 1, 2025. Written testimony from VSCC staff, intervenor witnesses and KU rebuttal has been filed. A public hearing on the matter is scheduled to start on November 13, 2024. KU is discussing the potential resolution of open issues raised by the VSCC staff. 
 
 DSIC Petition (PPL and PPL Electric) 
 
 On April 26, 2024, PPL Electric filed a Petition with the PAPUC requesting that the PAPUC waive PPL Electric's DSIC cap of 5 of billed revenues and increase the maximum allowable DSIC to 9 for bills rendered on or after January 1, 2025. The publicly available procedural and litigation schedule currently contemplates that the PAPUC would issue a final order at its January 23, 2025 Public Meeting. PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Long-Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan Petition (LTIIP) (PPL and PPL Electric) 
 
 On January 17, 2024, PPL Electric filed a petition with the PAPUC seeking to modify its LTIIP, which covers the period from 2023 through 2027, to increase the total projected capital spending for existing LTIIP programs and to add a new LTIIP program related to predictive failure technology. On July 11, 2024, the PAPUC approved the petition in part, allowing for an increase of 203 million for existing LTIIP programs. The proposed new LTIIP program was determined not to be eligible for recovery under the DSIC. However, investments in such programs are potentially recoverable through a base rate proceeding. 
 
 Labor Union Agreements 
 
 (PPL) 
 
 In May 2024, PPL and the Rhode Island UWUA locals ratified a five-year labor agreement through May 2029. The agreement covers over 530 employees. The terms of the new labor agreement are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial results of PPL.

 (a) The increases were primarily due to reconcilable cost recovery mechanisms approved by the PAPUC. 
 (b) The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to weather, along with other higher usage in 2024 at PPL Electric. 
 (c) The decreases were primarily the result of lower energy prices and fewer PLR customers, partially offset by higher customer volumes due to weather and other higher usage. 
 (d) The increases were primarily due to returns on additional transmission capital investments, returns of depreciation and O M expenses and delayed implementation of moving to a calendar year rate in 2023, partially offset by the prior year point to point border rate settlement variance. 
 (e) The decreases were primarily due to an adjustment related to the ECR mechanism revenues. 
 (f) The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher recoveries of fuel expenses. 
 (g) The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher recoveries of energy purchases and an increase in transmission expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower recoveries of energy purchases, gross earnings tax and pension expenses, partially offset by higher recoveries of gas maintenance expenses, an increase in transmission expenses and higher recovery of energy efficiency expenses. 
 
 Energy Purchases 
 
 Energy purchases decreased 18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to lower PLR prices of 47 million at PPL Electric, partially offset by an increase in commodity costs of 28 million at RIE. 
 
 Energy purchases decreased 297 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to lower PLR prices of 222 million and lower PLR volumes of 19 million at PPL Electric, an 18 million decrease at LG E primarily due to a decrease in commodity costs and a decrease in commodity costs of 37 million at RIE.

 Earnings from Ongoing Operations 
 
 Management utilizes "Earnings from Ongoing Operations" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. 
 
 Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as: 
 
 Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. 
 Impairment charges. 
 Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. 
 Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments. 
 Significant losses on early extinguishment of debt. 
 Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing

 Operating Activities 
 
 The components of the change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2023 were as follows. 
 PPL PPL Electric LG E KU Change - Cash Provided (Used) Net income 84 57 22 43 Non-cash components 39 51 13 (3) Working capital (38) 14 (110) 19 Defined benefit plan funding 4 3 Other operating activities 92 (25) 5 13 Total 181 100 (70) 72 
 
 (PPL) 
 
 PPL's cash provided by operating activities in 2024 increased 181 million compared with 2023. 
 Net income increased 84 million between the periods and included an increase in non-cash components of 39 million. The increase in non-cash components was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements) and an increase in stock-based compensation (primarily due to overall market increases). 
 
 The 38 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather), a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in prepayments (primarily due to the timing of payments) and a decrease in net regulatory liabilities (primarily due to the timing of rate recovery mechanisms), partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to timing of payments). 
 
 The 92 million increase in cash provided by other operating activities was driven primarily by an increase in noncurrent regulatory liabilities. 
 
 (PPL Electric) 
 
 PPL Electric's cash provided by operating activities in 2024 increased 100 million compared with 2023. 
 Net income increased 57 million between the periods and included an increase in non-cash components of 51 million. The increase in non-cash components was primarily due to an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits (primarily due to book versus tax plant timing differences). 
 
 The 14 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to timing of payments), partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather), an increase in prepayments (primarily due to timing of payments) and an increase in net regulatory assets (primarily due to the timing of rate recovery mechanisms).

 The 25 million decrease in cash provided by other operating activities was driven primarily by an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets. 
 
 (LG E) 
 
 LG E's cash provided by operating activities in 2024 decreased 70 million compared with 2023. 
 Net income increased 22 million between the periods and included an increase in non-cash components of 13 million. The increase in non-cash components was primarily due to an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits (primarily due to book versus tax plant timing differences). 
 
 The 110 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather), an increase in fuel, materials and supplies (primarily due to lower commodity costs in the prior year), an increase in accounts receivable from affiliates (primarily due to timing of payments) and an increase in net regulatory assets (primarily due to the timing of rate recovery mechanisms), partially offset by an increase in accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments). 
 
 The 5 million increase in cash provided by other operating activities was driven by a decrease in other assets (primarily related to lower deferred storm costs recorded as noncurrent regulatory assets). 
 
 (KU) 
 
 KU's cash provided by operating activities in 2024 increased 72 million compared with 2023. 
 Net income increased 43 million between the periods and included a decrease in non-cash components of 3 million. 
 
 The 19 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable to affiliates (primarily due to timing of payments) and a decrease in fuel, materials and supplies (primarily due to weather), partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather). 
 
 The 13 million increase in cash provided by other operating activities was driven by a decrease in other assets (primarily related to preliminary survey costs for new generation projects in the prior year). 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 The components of the change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2023 were as follows. 
 PPL PPL Electric LG E KU Change - Cash Provided (Used) Expenditures for PP E (204) (167) (50) (33) Notes receivable from affiliate (418) Other investing activities (1) (5) Total (205) (585) (50) (38) 
 
 For PPL, the increase in expenditures for PP E was due to an increase in project expenditures at PPL Electric, RIE, LG E and KU. The increase in expenditures at PPL Electric was primarily due to increases in transmission and distribution projects. The increase in expenditures at LG E and KU was primarily due to Mill Creek Unit 5 and increases in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure initiative. 
 
 For PPL Electric, the change in "Notes receivable from affiliate" activity resulted from the funding of 418 million to an affiliate. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of intercompany borrowings.

 Forecasted Uses of Cash (PPL) 
 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 
 In August 2024, PPL declared a quarterly common stock dividend, payable October 1, 2024, of 25.75 cents per share. Future dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors. 
 
 Rating Agency Actions 
 
 (All Registrants) 
 
 Moody's and S P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. 
 
 A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. 
 
 The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt. 
 
 Since June 2023, the rating agencies have taken no ratings actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries.

Ratings Triggers 
 
 (PPL, LG E and KU) 
 
 Various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, and interest rate instruments, contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LG E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL for derivative contracts in a net liability position at September 30, 2024.

Risk Management (All Registrants) 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 See Notes 13 and 14 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations. 
 
 The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 PPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases. 
 
 The following interest rate hedges were outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) (a) Effect of a 10 Adverse Movement in Rates (b) Maturities Ranging Through PPL and LG E Economic hedges Interest rate swaps (c) 64 (7) (1) 2033 
 
 (a) Includes accrued interest, if applicable. 
 (b) Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. Sensitivities represent a 10 adverse movement in interest rates. 
 (c) Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. 
 
 The Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10 adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt at September 30, 2024 is shown below.

 10 Adverse Movement in Rates on Fair Value of Debt PPL 613 PPL Electric 261 LG E 88 KU 129 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 PPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below. 
 
 PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its PAPUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. 
 LG E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs. 
 RIE utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its RIPUC-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. RIE's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. RIE's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms. RIE is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide Last Resort Service (LRS). Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve LRS customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. RIE is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth program and Long-term Clean Energy Standard. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices. 
 
 Volumetric Risk 
 
 Volumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below: 
 
 PPL Electric, LG E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases. 
 RIE is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to RIE's delivery rates. 
 
 Inflation and Supply Chain Related Risk 
 
 PPL and its subsidiaries continue to monitor the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions. PPL and its subsidiaries monitor the cost of fuel, construction, regulatory and environmental compliance costs and other costs. Mechanisms are in place to mitigate the risk of inflationary effects and supply chain disruptions, to the extent possible, but increased costs and supply chain disruptions may directly or indirectly affect our ongoing operations. These mechanisms include pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions in order to ensure that the Registrants are able to procure the necessary materials and other resources needed to maintain services in a safe and reliable manner, and to grow infrastructure consistent with the capital expenditure plan. For additional information see "Forward-looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors" of the Registrants' 2023 Form 10-K.

 Related Party Transactions (All Registrants) 
 
 The Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LG E and KU. 

Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures (All Registrants) 
 
 The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information on acquisition, development, and divestiture activity. 

Environmental Matters (All Registrants) 
 
 Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to the Registrants' air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. 
 
 See "Environmental Matters" in Item 1. "Business" in the Registrants' 2023 Form 10-K for information about environmental laws and regulations affecting the Registrants' business. See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Registrants' 2023 Form 10-K for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2024 through 2026.

 The information below represents an update to Item 1. Business Environmental Matters in the Registrants' 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Air (PPL, LG E and KU) 
 
 NAAQS 
 
 The Clean Air Act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically to establish and review NAAQS for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In December 2020, the EPA released final actions keeping the existing NAAQS standard for particulate matter and ozone without change, but the EPA subsequently announced reconsideration of those decisions in June 2021. On February 2, 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court granted the EPA s motion for voluntary remand, without vacatur, of the ozone rule. EPA will complete a new review to incorporate new studies and updated analyses to determine the adequacy of the existing ozone standard. On March 6, 2024, the EPA finalized revisions to the particulate matter standard that lowers the primary standard for fine particulates. Based on the new standard, the EPA could potentially designate Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the new particulate matter standard and require additional particulate matter reductions from sources including LG E s Mill Creek Station. The new particulate matter standard may also result in more stringent requirements for new generation located in nonattainment areas. PPL, LG E, and KU are unable to predict future implementation actions or the outcome of future evaluations by the EPA and the states with respect to the NAAQS standards. 
 
 In March 2021, the EPA released final revisions to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), aimed at ensuring compliance with the 2008 ozone NAAQS and providing for reductions in ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions for 2021 and subsequent years. Additionally, the EPA reversed its previous approval of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan with respect to these 
 89 

Table of Cont en ts 

 requirements. In March 2023, the EPA Administrator released a final Federal Implementation Plan under the Good Neighbor provisions of the Clean Air Act providing for significant additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions for compliance with the revised 2015 ozone NAAQS. The reductions in Kentucky state-wide nitrogen oxide budgets were scheduled to commence in 2023, with the largest reductions planned for 2026, based on the installation time frame for certain selective catalytic reduction controls, subject to future specific allowance calculations. PPL, LG E and KU are currently assessing the potential impact of the Good Neighbor Plan revisions on operations. The rules provide for reduced availability of NOx allowances that have historically permitted operational flexibility for fossil units and could potentially result in constraints that may require implementation of additional emission controls or accelerate implementation of lower emission generation technologies. In response to judicial orders that stayed the EPA s denial of certain state implementation plans, the EPA in July 2023 issued an interim stay of implementation of Good Neighbor Plan requirements for emission sources in several states including Kentucky. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Good Neighbor Plan while the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit considers numerous legal challenges to the Good Neighbor Plan. On September 12, 2024, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA s motion for voluntary partial remand of the Good Neighbor Plan to allow it to supplement the record. On October 18, 2024, several states filed a petition challenging the order in the U.S. Supreme Court. 
 
 PPL, LG E, and KU are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation or future emission reductions that may be required by future federal rules or state implementation actions. Compliance with the NAAQS, CSAPR, Good Neighbor Plan, and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions, inclusive of retirements, the costs of which PPL, LG E and KU believe would be subject to rate recovery. 
 
 Modification of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards 
 
 In 2012, the EPA issued the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule requiring reductions in mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossil fuel-fired power plants. LG E and KU installed significant controls to achieve compliance with MATS and other rules. On May 7, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule increasing the stringency of MATS and further reducing emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants to reflect perceived developments in control technologies. Legal challenges to the rule have been filed in the D.C. Circuit Court. PPL, LG E, and KU are reviewing the final rule to determine its impact and do not expect significant operational changes or additional controls to be required. 
 
 Greenhouse Gas Standards 
 
 On May 9, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act which establishes performance standards and emissions limits aimed at reducing GHG emissions from certain new, existing, and modified fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). In the final rule, the EPA announced it would set performance standards for existing natural gas-fired turbines in a future rule. The standards require phased implementation of carbon mitigation technologies including state-of-the-art efficiency requirements, carbon capture and sequestration, and natural gas co-firing. New natural gas EGUs would be immediately subject to the stricter efficiency standard. Legal challenges to the rule have been filed in the D.C. Circuit Court. PPL, LG E, and KU are unable to predict the impact of new GHG reduction requirements until completion of a comprehensive review and resolution of related legal and regulatory proceedings. While the impact of new GHG reduction requirements on operations and financial results of operations could potentially be substantial, the cost of complying with such requirements is expected to be subject to rate recovery. 

New Accounting Guidance (All Registrants) 
 
 There has been no new accounting guidance adopted in 2024. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for discussion of significant accounting guidance pending adoption as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rules require registrants to disclose, among other things, material climate-related risks, activities to mitigate such risks and information about oversight by the registrant s board of directors and management s role in managing material climate-related risks. The final rule also requires registrants to provide information related to any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant s business, results of operations, or financial condition. A majority of the reporting requirements are applicable to the fiscal year beginning in 2025, with the addition of assurance reporting for greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2029 for large accelerated filers. Litigation challenging the new rule was filed by multiple parties in multiple jurisdictions, which have been consolidated and assigned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC announced that it is voluntarily staying the implementation of the 
 90 

Table of Cont en ts 

 climate disclosure regulations while the U.S. Court of Appeals considers the litigation. The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact of the final rules on their respective consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies (All Registrants 
 
 Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following table summarizes the accounting policies by Registrant that are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain.
