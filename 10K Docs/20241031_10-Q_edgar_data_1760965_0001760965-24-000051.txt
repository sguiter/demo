NOTE 1 
 
 Macroeconomic Environment and Other Recent Developments 
 Global macroeconomic conditions that continued to impact the Company include ongoing elevated interest rates, moderating inflation, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, supply chain issues and inconsistent consumer demand. These factors continue to contribute to uncertain global economic conditions and consumer spending patterns, which are impacting retailers' and the Company's operations. Additionally, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are causing disruption in the surrounding areas and greater uncertainty in the global economy. The Company considered the impact of these developments on the assumptions and estimates used when preparing these quarterly financial statements including, but not limited to, our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuations, liabilities for variable consideration, deferred tax valuation allowances, fair value measurements including asset impairment evaluations, the effectiveness of the Company s hedging instruments and expected compliance with all applicable financial covenants in our Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7 to the Company's financial statements in this Form 10-Q). These assumptions and estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained regarding the impact of the above conditions. Such future changes may have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity. 
 Out-of-Period Duty Expense Recorded in 2023 
 During the three months ended September 2023, management identified inaccuracies in processing certain transactions with U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("U.S. Customs") arising from the implementation of the Company's enterprise resource planning system, which resulted in an underpayment of duties owed to U.S. Customs for the 2021 to 2023 periods. Accordingly, the Company recorded million in adjustments in the third quarter of 2023 within "cost of goods sold" to accrue for this underpayment of duty expense. The out-of-period duty expense recorded in 2023 results in a lack of comparability between periods in the statements of operations, primarily in cost of goods sold.

 The Company considers its chief executive officer to be its chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based on the global brand operating results of Wrangler and Lee , which are the Company's operating and reportable segments. 
 In addition, we report an "Other" category to reconcile segment revenues and segment profit to the Company's operating results, but the Other category does not meet the criteria to be considered a reportable segment. Other includes sales and licensing of Rock Republic , other company-owned brands and private label apparel. 
 Accounting policies utilized for internal management reporting at the individual segments are consistent with those disclosed in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Corporate and other expenses, including certain restructuring and transformation costs, and interest income and expense are not controlled by segment management and therefore are excluded from the measurement of segment profit.

 The Company's cash equivalents include money market funds and short-term time deposits that approximate fair value based on Level 1 measurements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, which consist of foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements, is determined based on observable market inputs (Level 2), including spot and forward exchange rates for foreign currencies and observable interest rate yield curves for interest rate swap agreements. Investment securities are held in the Company's deferred compensation plans as an economic hedge of the related deferred compensation liabilities and are comprised of mutual funds that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). Liabilities related to the Company's deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of the participants selection of hypothetical investments (Level 2). 
 Additionally, at September 2024, the carrying value of the Company's long-term debt was million compared to a fair value of million. At December 2023, the carrying value of the Company's long-term debt was million compared to a fair value of million. The fair value of long-term debt is a Level 2 estimate based on quoted market prices or values of comparable borrowings. 
 All other financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded in the Company's financial statements at cost. These other financial assets and financial liabilities include cash held as demand deposits, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At September 2024 and December 2023, their carrying values approximated fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

 million at September 2024, million at December 2023 and million at September 2023, consisting primarily of contracts hedging exposures to the euro, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, British pound, Polish zloty and Swedish krona. Foreign currency exchange contracts have maturities up to months. 
 The Company periodically enters into "floating to fixed" interest rate swap agreements to mitigate exposure to volatility in reference rates on the Company's future interest payments. Because these swap agreements meet the criteria for hedge accounting, all related gains and losses are deferred within accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") and are amortized through the swap maturity dates. 
 During 2019, the Company entered into "floating to fixed" interest rate swap agreements (the "2019 Swap Agreements") that matured on April 18, 2024. On September 9, 2024, the Company entered into new "floating to fixed" interest rate swap agreements (the "2024 Swap Agreements") that mature on August 18, 2029. The notional amount of the 2024 Swap Agreements was million at September 2024. The notional amount of the 2019 Swap Agreements was million at December 2023 and September 2023. 
 The Company's outstanding derivative financial instruments met the criteria for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging relationship. At each reporting period, the Company assesses whether the hedging relationships continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. If the Company determines that a specific hedging relationship has ceased to be highly effective, it discontinues hedge accounting. All designated hedging relationships were determined to be highly effective as of September 2024.

 Any contracts that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheets.

 During the nine months ended September 2024, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest increased by million to million. Management believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by million within the next 12 fiscal months due to expiration of statutes of limitations, which would reduce income tax expense.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide readers of our financial statements with a narrative from management's perspective on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as certain other factors that may affect our future results. This section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Cautionary Statement On Forward-Looking Statements included later in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Description of Business 
 Kontoor Brands, Inc. ("Kontoor," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") is a global lifestyle apparel company headquartered in the United States ("U.S."). The Company designs, manufactures, procures, sells and licenses apparel, footwear and accessories, primarily under the brand names Wrangler and Lee . The Company's products are sold in the U.S. through mass merchants, specialty stores, department stores, company-operated stores and online, including digital marketplaces. The Company's products are also sold internationally, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), Asia-Pacific ("APAC") and Non-U.S. Americas regions, through department, specialty, company-operated, concession retail and independently-operated partnership stores and online, including digital marketplaces. 
 Fiscal Year and Basis of Presentation 
 The Company operates and reports using a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q presents the third quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending December 28, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), which is a 52-week fiscal year. For presentation purposes herein, all references to periods ended September 2024, December 2023 and September 2023 correspond to the fiscal periods ended September 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 References to fiscal 2024 foreign currency amounts herein reflect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates from the prior year comparable period and the corresponding impact on translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and on foreign currency-denominated transactions. The Company's most significant foreign currency translation exposure is typically driven by business conducted in euro-based countries, the Chinese yuan and the Mexican peso. However, the Company conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world with exposure to other foreign currencies. 
 Amounts herein may not recalculate due to the use of unrounded numbers. 
 Macroeconomic Environment and Other Recent Developments 
 Global macroeconomic conditions that continued to impact the Company include ongoing elevated interest rates, moderating inflation, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, supply chain issues and inconsistent consumer demand. These factors continue to contribute to uncertain global economic conditions and consumer spending patterns, which are impacting retailers' and the Company's operations. Additionally, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are causing disruption in the surrounding areas and greater uncertainty in the global economy. Inflationary pressures have moderated in recent quarters, and although these pressures continue to impact us, current period results reflect continued favorability from lower product costs compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 The macroeconomic factors discussed above, primarily interest rates and inflation, contributed to retailer actions to manage inventory levels, which impacted our results during the nine months ended September 2024. 
 Ongoing disruptions to key trade routes such as the Red Sea and Panama Canal, as well as political unrest in Bangladesh, affected our global supply chain during the third quarter of 2024 but did not have a significant impact on results. Additionally, we do not anticipate that these disruptions, as well as recent port strikes on the East and Gulf Coasts of the U.S., will have a significant impact on freight costs or operations in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The Company has responded to ongoing macroeconomic conditions by controlling expenses, adjusting pricing and proactively managing our global supply chain where possible. While we anticipate continued uncertainty related to the macroeconomic environment during 2024, we believe we are appropriately positioned to successfully manage through known operational challenges. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including consumer behavior and the impact of these factors on consumer demand. 
 
 Kontoor Brands, Inc. Q3 FY24 Form 10-Q 22 

Business Overview 
 We continue to execute on our strategic vision which focuses on four growth catalysts: (i) expansion of our core U.S. Wholesale business, (ii) category extensions such as outdoor, workwear and t-shirts, (iii) geographic expansion of our Wrangler and Lee brands, and (iv) channel expansion focused on the digital platforms in our U.S. Wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer channels. We are focused on driving brand growth and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders including our consumers, customers, shareholders, suppliers and communities around the world. 
 In addition, our capital allocation strategy allows us the option to (i) invest in our business, (ii) pay down debt, (iii) provide for a superior dividend payout, (iv) effectively manage our share repurchase authorization and (v) act on strategic acquisition opportunities that may arise. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company incurred total restructuring and transformation charges of 8.4 million, of which 2.1 million related to actions to streamline and transfer select production within our internal manufacturing network and 6.3 million related to business optimization activities associated with the detailed planning and initial execution phases of Project Jeanius. This comprehensive end-to-end business model transformation is focused on simplifying the organization and creating significant investment capacity to accelerate growth and increase profitability. We anticipate additional costs and benefits in future periods as we continue to execute on this multi-year initiative. Refer to No te 1 4 to the Company's financial statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information related to restructuring charges. 
 Out-of-Period Duty Expense Recorded in 2023 
 During the three months ended September 2023, management identified inaccuracies in processing certain transactions with U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("U.S. Customs") arising from the implementation of the Company's enterprise resource planning system, which resulted in an underpayment of duties owed to U.S. Customs for the 2021 to 2023 periods. Accordingly, the Company recorded 13.1 million in adjustments in the third quarter of 2023 within "cost of goods sold" to accrue for this underpayment of duty expense. The out-of-period duty expense recorded in 2023 results in a lack of comparability between periods in the statements of operations, primarily in cost of goods sold.

 Three Months Ended September 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 2023 
 Net revenues increased 2 , driven by a 5 increase in U.S. Wholesale revenues primarily attributable to growth in our digital wholesale business, expanded distribution and category growth, partially offset by retailer actions to manage inventory levels. Non-U.S. Wholesale revenues decreased 7 , driven predominantly by lower sales in EMEA and Mexico. Global Direct-to-Consumer revenues increased 3 with growth in e-commerce sales partially offset by declines in retail store sales. 
 Additional details on changes in net revenues for the three months ended September 2024 as compared to September 2023 are provided in the section titled Information by Business Segment. 
 Gross margin increased 320 basis points, primarily related to 290 basis points of favorability from product costs and channel mix and 200 basis points due to the out-of-period duty expense recorded in 2023. These benefits were partially offset by 120 basis points from lower pricing, proactive inventory management actions and product mix and 30 basis points from restructuring and transformation charges. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15.2 million, from 28.4 to 30.0 of net revenues, driven by 6.4 million of restructuring and other transformation charges in the third quarter of 2024, a 3.6 million increase in incentive compensation expense and a 2.3 million increase in demand creation investments. 
 Nine Months Ended September 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 2023 
 Net revenues decreased 2 , driven by an 8 decrease in the Non-U.S. Wholesale channel due to lower sales in EMEA and China. U.S. Wholesale revenues decreased 1 , primarily attributable to retailer actions to manage inventory levels and a decrease in revenue from seasonal product, partially offset by an increase in our digital wholesale business and category growth.

 Kontoor Brands, Inc. Q3 FY24 Form 10-Q 24 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 33.4 million, from 29.1 to 31.3 of net revenues, driven by a 14.4 million increase in incentive compensation expense, 10.2 million of higher investments in our direct-to-consumer business, demand creation and information technology and a 6.6 million increase in restructuring and transformation charges, partially offset by a 2.1 million reduction in distribution and freight costs. 
 The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 2024 was 19.5 compared to 21.4 in the 2023 period. The nine months ended September 2024 included a net discrete tax benefit primarily related to stock-based compensation which decreased the effective income tax rate by 0.7 . The nine months ended September 2023 included a net discrete tax expense primarily related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets associated with a tax holiday granted from local income taxes in a foreign jurisdiction which increased the effective income tax rate by 2.4 . The effective tax rate without discrete items for the nine months ended September 2024 was 20.2 compared to 19.0 in the 2023 period. The increase was primarily due to changes in our jurisdictional mix of earnings.

Reconciliation of Segment Profit to Income Before Income Taxes 
 
 The costs below are necessary to reconcile total reportable segment profit to income before taxes. Corporate and other expenses, including certain restructuring and transformation costs, and interest income and expense are not controlled by segment management and therefore are excluded from the measurement of segment profit.

 Corporate and other expenses increased 6.2 million, primarily due to an increase in restructuring and transformation charges compared to the prior period. 
 Interest expense increased 0.7 million, primarily due to the maturity of the 2019 Swap Agreements in April 2024, partially offset by the effect of lower average debt outstanding during the three months ended September 2024 compared to the three months ended September 2023. In addition, the three months ended September 2023 included interest attributable to the out-of-period duty expense recorded in 2023.

In addition, the nine months ended September 2023 included interest attributable to the out-of-period duty expense recorded in 2023. 

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company's ability to fund our operating needs is dependent upon our ability to generate positive long-term cash flow from operations and maintain our debt financing on acceptable terms. The Company has historically generated strong positive cash flows from operations and continues to take proactive measures to manage working capital. During the nine months ended September 2024, the Company repaid a total of 40.0 million of the principal outstanding on Term Loan A, including 25.0 million of voluntary early repayments which reduced future required quarterly repayments. We believe cash flows from operations will support our short-term liquidity needs as well as any future liquidity and capital requirements, in combination with available cash balances and borrowing capacity from our revolving credit facility. 
 The Company is party to a senior secured Credit Agreement, as amended and restated on November 18, 2021 (the Credit Agreement ), which provides for (i) a five-year 400.0 million term loan A facility Term Loan A and (ii) a five-year 500.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ), collectively referred to as Credit Facilities, with the lenders and agents party thereto. Term Loan A requires quarterly repayments of 5.0 million through September 2026, and the remaining principal of 335.0 million is due at maturity in November 2026. Additionally, the Company has outstanding 400.0 million of unsecured 4.125 senior notes due 2029. The Company has "floating to fixed" interest rate swap agreements to mitigate exposure to volatility in reference rates on the Company's future interest payments. Refer to Note 11 in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 7 to the Company's financial statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Company s debt obligations, and refer to Note 9 to the Company's financial statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Company's interest rate swap agreements. 
 
 Kontoor Brands, Inc. Q3 FY24 Form 10-Q 28 

As of September 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement and expects to maintain compliance with the applicable covenants for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. If economic conditions significantly deteriorate for a prolonged period, this could impact the Company s operating results and cash flows and thus our ability to maintain compliance with the applicable covenants. As a result, the Company could be required to seek new amendments to the Credit Agreement or secure other sources of liquidity, such as refinancing of existing borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity securities, or sales of assets. However, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and certain non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a maximum borrowing capacity of 500.0 million with a 75.0 million letter of credit sublimit. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 2024. 
 The following table presents outstanding borrowings and available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility and our cash and cash equivalents balances as of September 2024: 
 (In millions) September 2024 Outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility Available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility (1) 
 493.5 Cash and cash equivalents 269.4 
 (1) Available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is net of 6.5 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company under this facility. 
 At September 2024, the Company had 20.0 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either the Company or the banks. There were no outstanding balances under these arrangements at September 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 2024, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of Common Stock for 85.0 million, including commissions, under its 300.0 million share repurchase program authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All shares reacquired in connection with the repurchase program are treated as authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase. As of September 2024, 215.0 million remained available for repurchase under the program. 
 During the nine months ended September 2024, the Company paid 83.3 million of dividends to its shareholders. On October 24, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.52 per share of the Company's Common Stock. The cash dividend will be payable on December 19, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2024. 
 The Company intends to continue to pay cash dividends in future periods. The declaration and amount of any future dividends will be dependent upon multiple factors including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, covenants associated with our debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and any other factors or considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. 
 We anticipate that we will have sufficient cash flows from operations, along with existing borrowing capacity, to support continued investments in our brands, infrastructure, talent and capabilities, dividend payments to shareholders, repayment of our debt obligations when due and repurchases of Common Stock. In addition, we would use current liquidity as well as access to capital markets to fund any strategic acquisition opportunities that may arise. 
 We currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 25.0 million in 2024, primarily to support manufacturing, distribution, facility improvement, information technology and owned retail store investments. 
 The following table presents our cash flows during the periods: 
 Nine Months Ended September (In millions) 2024 2023 Cash provided (used) by: Operating activities 286.3 147.5 Investing activities (16.5) (31.3) Financing activities (210.8) (98.0) 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 286.3 million as compared to 147.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher net income as well as favorable changes in working capital, which included accounts payable, inventory, accrued and other current liabilities and income taxes. 
 
 29 Kontoor Brands, Inc. Q3 FY24 Form 10-Q 

Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 2024, cash used by investing activities was 16.5 million as compared to 31.3 million in the prior year period, primarily due to decreases in expenditures of property, plant and equipment and capitalized computer software in the current year period. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 2024, cash used by financing activities was 210.8 million as compared to 98.0 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to 85.0 million of Common Stock repurchases and 40.0 million in repayments of Term Loan A during the nine months ended September 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments 
 The section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations" included in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K provided a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2023 that would require the use of funds. As of September 2024, there have been no material changes in the amounts disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 We have chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in conformity with GAAP. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because our business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade accounts receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to future events and are therefore inherently uncertain, especially as it relates to events outside of our control. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known. Refer to Note 1 to the Company's financial statements in this Form 10-Q for considerations related to the macroeconomic environment and other recent developments. 
 The accounting policies that involve the most significant estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of the financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are discussed within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these policies disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards 
 Refer to Note 1 to the Company's financial statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting standards. 
 Cautionary Statement on Forward-looking Statements 
 
 From time to time, the Company may make oral or written statements, including statements in this quarterly report, that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to the Company s operations or economic performance and assumptions related thereto. Forward-looking statements are made based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Company and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. In addition, the forward-looking statements in this report are made as of the date of this filing, and the Company does not undertake, and expressly disclaims any duty, to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, new developments, or otherwise, except to the extent that disclosure may be required by law. 
 
 Kontoor Brands, Inc. Q3 FY24 Form 10-Q 30 

Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of the Company to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements in this report include, but are not limited to: macroeconomic conditions, including elevated interest rates, inflation, recessionary concerns and fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, as well as continuing global supply chain issues and geopolitical events, continue to adversely impact global economic conditions and have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows (including future uncertain impacts); the level of consumer demand for apparel; reliance on a small number of large customers; supply chain and shipping disruptions, which could continue to result in shipping delays, an increase in transportation costs and increased product costs or lost sales; intense industry competition; the ability to accurately forecast demand for products; the Company s ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends, and to respond to constantly changing markets; the Company s ability to maintain the images of its brands; increasing pressure on margins; e-commerce operations through the Company s direct-to-consumer business; the financial difficulty experienced by the retail industry; possible goodwill and other asset impairment; the ability to implement the Company s business strategy; the stability of manufacturing facilities and foreign suppliers; fluctuations in wage rates and the price, availability and quality of raw materials and contracted products; the reliance on a limited number of suppliers for raw material sourcing and the ability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity or quality; disruption to distribution systems; seasonality; unseasonal or severe weather conditions; the Company's and its vendors ability to maintain the strength and security of information technology systems; the risk that facilities and systems and those of third-party service providers may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate or detect data security breaches and data or financial loss or maintain operational performance; ability to properly collect, use, manage and secure consumer and employee data; disruption and volatility in the global capital and credit markets and its impact on the Company's ability to obtain short-term or long-term financing on favorable terms; legal, regulatory, political and economic risks; changes to trade policy, including tariff and import/export regulations; the impact of climate change and related legislative and regulatory responses; compliance with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws by the Company and third-party suppliers and manufacturers; changes in tax laws and liabilities; the costs of compliance with or the violation of national, state and local laws and regulations for environmental, consumer protection, employment, privacy, safety and other matters; continuity of members of management; labor relations; the ability to protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights; the ability of the Company s licensees to generate expected sales and maintain the value of the Company s brands; the Company maintaining satisfactory credit ratings; restrictions on the Company s business relating to its debt obligations; volatility in the price and trading volume of the Company s common stock; anti-takeover provisions in the Company s organizational documents; and fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our share repurchases. Many of the foregoing risks and uncertainties will be exacerbated by any worsening of the global business and economic environment. 
 More information on potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results are described in detail in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports and statements that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no material changes in the Company's market risk exposures set forth under Item 7A in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")). Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Careful consideration of the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented below, should be made. 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K: 
 Environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues and regulations, including those related to climate change and sustainability, and stakeholder response thereto may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. 
 Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG practices and policies. The landscape related to ESG regulation, compliance, and reporting is constantly evolving, including expanding in scope and complexity. For example, the SEC, the State of California, and the European Commission have published proposed or final rules, including the European Commission's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, that would require significantly increased disclosures related to climate change and other issues. We may experience significant future cost increases associated with regulatory compliance for ESG matters, including fees, licenses, reporting, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital or negatively impact our stock price, as investors may reconsider their capital investment based on their assessment of our ESG practices and policies. In particular, investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, shareholders, employees, consumers, customers, regulators, proxy advisory services and other market participants have increasingly focused on ESG practices and policies of companies. These stakeholders have placed increased importance on ESG practices and their effect on companies from an investor, consumer, customer or employee perspective. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards or evolving regulatory requirements, our stock price, brand, sales, ability to access capital markets, reputation and employee retention, among other things, may be negatively affected. 
 In addition, we have published goals across a range of ESG areas, including environmental sustainability, greenhouse gas emissions, and diversity, equity and inclusion matters. Although we intend to meet these goals, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of these goals, or for any revisions to our goals. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, technological developments, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we do not adapt to or comply with new ESG regulations, such as those related to climate change, carbon emissions and related ESG disclosure requirements, or fail to meet our goals or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived (whether or not valid) to have not responded appropriately to the growing and various concerns for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial results may be adversely affected. Further, if we incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders related to our ESG efforts and goals, the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, could be adversely impacted which could adversely impact our business and financial results.
