 wholly-owned United States subsidiaries, Nicholas Data Services, Inc. ("NDS") and Nicholas Financial, Inc. ("NFI"). On April 18, 2024, Old Market Capital Corporation completed its continuation and domestication from British Columbia to the State of Delaware by filing its Certificate of Corporate Domestication and Certification of Incorporation in the State of Delaware. As a result of the domestication, the Company's common stock par value increased from 0.00 to 0.01 on a one-for-one basis. NDS historically was engaged in supporting and updating industry specific computer application software for small businesses located primarily in the Southeastern United States. NDS has ceased its operations; however, it continues as the interim holding company for Old Market Capital Corporation. NFI was a specialized consumer finance company engaged primarily in acquiring and servicing automobile finance installment contracts for purchases of used and new automobiles and light trucks. NFI had also offered direct consumer loans and sold consumer finance related products. NFI and NDS are based in Florida, U.S.A. On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Westlake Services, LLC dba Westlake Financial, a California limited liability company ("Westlake Financial"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell substantially all of the finance receivables and all of the repossessed assets of Old Market Capital Corporation and NFI. In connection with entering into the Purchase Agreement, the Company ceased new loan originations of contracts and direct loans. On April 26, 2024, the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed. See Note 12 for additional information. On June 15, 2024 , Old Market Capital Corporation closed upon the acquisition of of the issued and outstanding common shares of Amplex Electric Inc. ("Amplex"). Amplex is a provider of broadband internet, voice over internet protocol (VOIP), and video services within service areas located primarily in Northwest and North Central Ohio. Amplex currently has over fixed wireless broadband customers over fiber passings and over fiber customers. Amplex's customer base includes residential and commercial customers. Amplex leases certain property (including an office building) and warehouse building from Red Bug, LLC and Red Bug Properties, Ltd. (collectively, the "Red Bug Entities"). The Red Bug Entities were created by, and are majority-owned by Amplex's Chief Executive Officer.

to years. Annually, or when certain triggering events occur, the Company assesses the useful lives of its intangibles with definite lives. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. The Company is required to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist due to triggering events, by determining if the carrying value of the Company's goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of said goodwill. Indicators that could trigger an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to, underperformance relative to projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends, an adverse change in regulatory environment, or pending adverse litigation. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 that the fair value of the Company's goodwill is less than its carrying value as of the assessment date. If no events, facts, or circumstances are identified during the qualitative assessment, the Company does not need to perform a quantitative impairment assessment. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, then the Company will perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill

to years. The lease term may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. In addition, the Company does not recognize short term leases that have a term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities for all asset classes. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to account for as a single lease component for all asset classes when the payments are fixed. As such, variable lease payments, including those not dependent on an index or rate, such as real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and other costs that are subject to fluctuation from period to period are not included in lease measurement. Upon the acquisition of Amplex on June 15, 2024 , the Company recorded lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets of approximately thousand, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments for leases existing upon adoption of the new lease standard and other adjustments to the opening balance of right of use assets. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of payments. See Note 8 for additional detail on the Company's leasing arrangements. 
 thousand. The Borrower agrees to make monthly payments of interest on each Term Loan Advance, commencing on March 1, 2024, and on the first day of each month thereafter. No payments of principal are due until the earlier of a) closing of a share purchase agreement (the "Transaction Closing Date") or b) in the event of terminating the negotiation of a share purchase agreement ("Triggering Event"), the first anniversary of the date of initial Term Loan Advance (the "Term Loan Maturity Date"). All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Loan Advance is due and payable in cash on the Term Loan Maturity Date. Amounts may be prepaid without penalty by giving five days written notice to the Lender. Interest is accrued on Term Loan Advances at an interest rate of per annum. Per the amended terms of the Term Loan Agreement, at the Transaction Closing Date, the outstanding debt from the Term Loan Advances shall automatically be converted into the number of common shares of Amplex determined by dividing the outstanding debt from the Term Loan Advances by the share purchase price (the "Converted Shares"). The Term Loans were converted upon the Transaction Closing Date as of June 15, 2024 (a total of approximately thousand, comprised of thousand of principal and thousand of accrued interest) at the share purchase price of per share into shares of Amplex common stock. As of March 31, 2024, the Term Loan Advance receivable was accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security and fair valued using "Level 3" inputs, which consist of unobservable inputs and reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset. The Company's Term Loan Advances were determined to be available-for-sale debt securities under ASC 320, Investments - Debt Securities . The Company estimated the fair value of the Term Loan Advances as of March 31, 2024 using a probability-weighted scenario-based model, which uses as inputs the estimated fair value of the Borrower's common stock, the estimated volatility of the Borrower's common stock, the time to expiration of the Term Loan Advances, the discount rate, the stated interest rate compared to the current market rate, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration. The estimated fair value of the Borrower's common stock was based on the estimated closing price of the Amplex shares to the Company at the time of issuance. The estimated volatility of the Borrower's common stock was based on the observed volatility range of comparable publicly traded companies. The time to expiration was based on the probability of conversion prior to the contractual maturity date. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration.

thousand. The Term Loan Advances were to be repaid at the earlier of a) the closing of the share purchase agreement and b) the first anniversary of the initial term loan advance date if the negotiations of the share purchase agreement are terminated. As mentioned above, the Term Loan Advances with a total outstanding principal and accrued interest of thousand was converted into shares of Amplex common stock from a selling shareholder at the share purchase price of per share in conjunction with the closing of the share purchase agreement. 
 Dissenting Shares exercised in accordance with the Dissent Right. The Company determined the Dissenting Shares are within the scope of ASC 480-10 as they are considered mandatorily redeemable as of the Approval Date and as such were classified as liabilities. Liability-classified instruments are initially measured at fair value (or allocated value). Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized through earnings for as long as the instruments continue to be classified as a liability. As of April 15, 2024, the Company determined the fair value of the Dissenting Shares was million based on the Company s stock price of . On September 5, 2024, the Company settled in cash with the dissenting shareholders to repurchase Dissenting Shares at a price per share of , or million. The Dissenting Shares were retained by the Company to be included within treasury stock. In conjunction with the cash settlement, the Company recognized a loss on dissenting shareholders liability of million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and derecognized the dissenting shareholders' liability. In addition, the repurchase of the Dissenting Shares (which were retained by the Company) were included within treasury stock as of the date of repurchase.

 In accordance with ASC 606 Revenue Recognition , the Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below: 1. identify the customer contract; 

 2. identify performance obligations that are distinct; 

 3. determine the transaction price; 

 4. allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and 

 5. recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. 

 Identify the customer contract A customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both the Company and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable. Specifically, the Company obtains written/electronic signatures on contracts and purchase orders, if said purchase orders are issued in the normal course of business by the customer.

The Company determined the put option is not within the scope of ASC 480-10 to be recorded as a liability at fair value and will not subsequently adjust for changes in fair value. The Company adjusts redeemable noncontrolling interests for the portion of net loss attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interests and for the change in the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interest for the incremental value the NCI holder may ultimately be entitled to. When the redemption amount of redeemable noncontrolling interest exceeds the fair value, the Company has made an accounting policy election to reflect as a deemed dividend the entire change in the redemption amount (see Note 5). For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the change in the redemption amount was deemed immaterial. As of September 30, 2024, the book value of this interest was approximately million and was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

(the "Closing Date"), the Company closed a share purchase agreement to acquire Amplex from the sellers (the Sellers ), pursuant to which the Sellers have agreed to sell, and the Company has agreed to purchase of the issued and outstanding common shares, no par value per share, of Amplex and the Company agreed to make payment to holders of options for Amplex s common shares in consideration of cancellation of such options for total purchase consideration of million, which was paid in cash on the date of closing (the "Amplex Acquisition"). Amplex is an Ohio-based provider of rural broadband services to business and residential customers. The Company acquired Amplex in order to provide better shareholder value over time. The financial results of Amplex have been included within the condensed consolidated financial statements since the Closing Date. In conjunction with the closing of the Amplex Acquisition, the Company converted the outstanding principal and accrued interest of approximately million under the Term Loan Advances into shares of Amplex common stock at the share purchase price of and purchased an additional shares of Amplex common stock at a price of per share for a total of million. These transactions concurrently executed at the Transaction Closing Date increased the Company's ownership in Amplex to . In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , the Amplex Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess purchase price over the preliminary estimated fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Amplex Acquisition. The purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available. The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. The fair value of the subscriber relationships were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method MPEEM under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the operating cash flows generated by this asset after taking into account the cost to realize the revenue, and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value and risk associated with the invested capital. The Company utilized the relief-from-royalty method, a form of both the market and income approach, to determine the fair value of the trade names. Under this method, it is assumed that if the Company did not own the intangible asset, it would be willing to pay a royalty for its use. Internally developed software was valued using a cost approach, specifically the cost to re-create method. The cost to re-create method considers the cost required to recreate an identical asset considering current prices of direct and indirect costs. These costs are then adjusted for the developers profit, which reflects the expected return on the direct and indirect costs, and opportunity cost, which represents the forgone returns during the period when the asset is being developed. The Citizens Broadband Radio Service FCC license ("CBRS FCC license") was valued using a cost approach, specifically, the cost incurred by the business in acquiring the CBRS FCC license. In determining the fair value of the property, plant, and equipment, the Company used a combination of various valuation techniques including the income approach, the cost approach, and the market approach.

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately thousand and from continuing operations for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

million and million, respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired federal NOLs of approximately million related to the Amplex acquisition . The federal NOLs generated for the six months ended September 30, 2024 , will carryforward . Generally, state NOLs begin to expire . In accordance with Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the usage of the Company's NOL carryforwards is subject to annual limitations following greater than 50 ownership changes. Tax returns for the years ended 2021 through 2024 are subject to review by tax authorities. The Company s effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , was and , respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was - and , respectively. The change in the effective tax rate from the comparison of 2024 and 2023, as noted above, primarily relates to the operations of Amplex. The Company records a valuation allowance for OMCC since there is not sufficient evidence of future earnings to support a position that it will be more likely than not to realize its net deferred tax asset. As a result of the sale of finance receivables and repossessed assets to Westlake Financial, the Company also reported discontinued operations for the historical Nicholas Financial entity. 

 million, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Westlake Financial was due to make additional payments to the Company based on a percentage of cash collections received over a predetermined threshold on the loan portfolio from September 30, 2023 through the closing of the disposition. On April 26, 2024, Westlake Financial made a million payment to the Company at the closing of the disposition. Subsequent to closing, the Company and Westlake Financial determined that Westlake Financial overpaid the Company million. On July 25, 2024, the arrangement between the Company and Westlake regarding a reconciliation of the initial payment to Nicholas Financial, escrow, and contingent consideration was settled, which resulted in the Company paying Westlake Financial million and waiving the right to any future contingent payments from Westlake Financial as originally stated in the Purchase Agreement. As a result of the sale of the Company's finance receivables and repossessed assets to Westlake, the Company recognized a gain of million, calculated as the excess of the total consideration over the carrying value of the finance receivables and repossessed assets sold to Westlake. The disposition of the finance receivables and all of its repossessed assets represents a strategic shift in the business based on the total assets, revenue, and net income of the segment sold to Westlake in comparison to the financial information of the Company as a whole.

 Overview 
 Old Market Capital Corporation ("OMCC") is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with two wholly owned subsidiaries, Nicholas Data Services, Inc. ("NDS") and Nicholas Financial, Inc. ("NFI"). NDS historically was engaged in supporting and updating industry specific computer application software for small businesses located primarily in the Southeastern United States. NDS has ceased its operations; however, it continues as the interim holding company for Old Market Capital Corporation. NFI was a specialized consumer finance company engaged primarily in acquiring and servicing automobile finance installment contracts for purchases of used and new automobiles and light trucks. NFI had also offered direct consumer loans and sold consumer finance related products. NFI and NDS are based in Florida, U.S.A. 
 Change in Operating Strategy 
 On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Westlake Services, LLC dba Westlake Financial, a California limited liability company ("Westlake Financial"), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to sell substantially all of the Company's finance receivables and all of its repossessed assets. On April 26, 2024, the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed. The Company intends to explore strategic alternatives for the use of the net proceeds of the asset sale. 
 On June 15, 2024, the Company closed a share purchase agreement to acquire 51 of the issued and outstanding common shares of Amplex Electric, Inc. ("Amplex"). As a result of the acquisition of Amplex, we commenced our broadband services business. Amplex is a provider of broadband internet, voice over internet protocol (VOIP), and video services that serves over 9,100 fixed wireless broadband customers, over 9,000 fiber passings and over 3,500 fiber customers located primarily in Northwest and North Central Ohio. 
 Concurrently, on June 15, 2024, the Company converted the outstanding principal of 0.8 million under the Term Loan Advances into 421 shares of Amplex common stock at the Share Purchase Price of 1,792.55 and purchased 1,674 shares of Amplex common stock at the same Share Purchase Price for a purchase price of 3.0 million (collectively, the "Additional NICK Closing Stock"). These transactions concurrently executed at the Transaction Closing Date increased the Company's ownership in Amplex to 56.5 . 
 How We Generate Revenues and Evaluate our Business 
 The Company generates revenues primarily through customer contracts and provides wireless internet services, fiber internet services, and other services including voice over telephone services. The Company fulfills obligations and recognizes revenue under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration 
 31 

from the customer. Payments received or consideration billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Further, the Company records accounts receivable for services billed in advance. 
 Operating income (loss) is a key metric that we use to evaluate segment operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. We define operating income (loss) as revenues less operating expenses. Operating expenses include cost of wireless and fiber internet services, cost of other revenue, plant specific and nonspecific operations expenses, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses.

Cost of Wireless and Fiber Internet Services and Cost of Other Revenue of Continuing Operations 
 Cost of wireless and fiber internet services totaled 157 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, cost of other revenue totaled 209 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As discussed above, the Company now provides wireless internet, fiber internet, and other services in conjunction with its acquisition of Amplex. Therefore, the cost of wireless and fiber internet services and cost of other revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior period. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's cost of wireless and fiber internet services and cost of other revenue is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Plant Specific and Plant Nonspecific Operations of Continuing Operations 
 Plant specific and plant nonspecific operations expenses totaled 551 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Due to the Company's acquisition of Amplex, the Company began providing additional services during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that were not provided in prior periods. Therefore, plant specific and nonspecific operations expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior period. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's plant specific and nonspecific operations expenses are not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 General and Administrative Expenses of Continuing Operations 
 General and administrative expenses totaled 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 million three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to additional professional fees and restructuring expenses incurred in relation to the acquisition of Amplex which was acquired by the Company during the period. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's general and administrative expenses are not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses of Continuing Operations 
 Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 501 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22 thousand three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to an increase in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets resulting from the Company's acquisition of Amplex. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's depreciation and amortization expense is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Loss on Dissenting Shareholders' Liability of Continuing Operations 
 Loss on dissenting shareholders' liability was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in loss on dissenting shareholders' liability is a result of the change in fair value of the liability during the period that represents the amount owed to dissenting shareholders from the sale of assets to Westlake. As of September 30, 2024, the Company settled the total amount owed to the dissenting shareholders. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Income from discontinued operations was 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income for three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributed to a decrease in general and administrative expenses and a decrease in credit losses due to the sale of the finance receivables and repossessed assets to Westlake when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue totaled 3.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to additional services the Company now provides from the acquisition of Amplex that were not provided in the prior period. Through acquiring Amplex, the Company now provides wireless internet services, fiber internet services, and other services including VOIP telephone and video streaming. Further, with the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's revenue is not comparable on a year-over-year basis.

Cost of Wireless and Fiber Internet Services and Cost of Other Revenue of Continuing Operations 
 Cost of wireless and fiber internet services totaled 187 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, cost of other revenue totaled 245 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. As discussed above, the Company now provides wireless internet, fiber internet, and other services in conjunction with its acquisition of Amplex. Therefore, the cost of wireless and fiber internet services and cost of other revenue increased during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and when compared to the prior period. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's cost of wireless and fiber internet services and cost of other revenue is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Plant Specific and Plant Nonspecific Operations of Continuing Operations 
 34 

Plant specific and plant nonspecific operations expenses totaled 663 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Due to the Company's acquisition of Amplex, the Company began providing additional services during the six months ended September 30, 2024 that were not provided in prior periods. Therefore, plant specific and nonspecific operations expenses increased for the six months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior period. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's plant specific and nonspecific operations expenses are not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 General and Administrative Expenses of Continuing Operations 
 General and administrative expenses totaled 6.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.1 million six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to additional professional fees and restructuring expenses incurred in relation to the acquisition of Amplex which was acquired by the Company during the period. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's general and administrative expenses are not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses of Continuing Operations 
 Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 595 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44 thousand six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to an increase in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets resulting from the Company's acquisition of Amplex. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's depreciation and amortization expense is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Emigration Tax Expense of Continuing Operations 
 Emigration tax expense was 1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in emigration tax expense in the current period is due to the Company completing its continuation and domestication from a company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia to a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as of April 18, 2024. 
 Loss on Dissenting Shareholders' Liability of Continuing Operations 
 Loss on dissenting shareholders' liability was 1.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in loss on dissenting shareholders' liability is a result of the change in fair value of the liability during the period that represents the amount owed to dissenting shareholders from the sale of assets to Westlake. As of September 30, 2024, the Company settled the total amount owed to the dissenting shareholders. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Income from discontinued operations was 0.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of 5.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributed to a decrease in general and administrative expenses and a decrease in credit losses due to the sale of the finance receivables and repossessed assets to Westlake when compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed on the Share Purchase Agreement with Amplex, in which the Company purchased 51 of the issued and outstanding common shares, no par value per share, of Amplex and to make payment to holders of options for Amplex s common shares in consideration of cancellation of such options 
 35 

for total purchase consideration of 18.4 million. In conjunction with the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company converted the outstanding principal and accrued interest of approximately 0.8 million under the Term Loan Advances into 421 shares of Amplex common stock at the Share Purchase Price of 1,792.55 and purchased an additional 1,674 shares of Amplex common stock at the share purchase price of 1,792.55 per share for a purchase price of 3.0 million. For further details of the acquisition, refer to Note 3. 
 The Company's cash flows are summarized as follows:

(25,250) 

Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities decreased for the six months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash (used in) provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net loss of 5.3 million, noncash charge of 1.1 million for the loss on dissenting shareholders' liability, and net change in operating assets and liabilities of 1.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations of 10.5 million. Further, with the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's change in cash provided by operating activities is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities decreased for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to 18.3 million of cash paid for the acquisition of Amplex in June 2024, partially offset by an increase in net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of 14.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. With the Company's Purchase Agreement in April of 2024 and the acquisition in June of 2024, the Company's change in cash provided by investing activities is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to repayments on credit facilities of 25.3 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023 partially offset by the repurchase of 5.6 million worth of shares of common stock held by dissenting shareholders during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024. Part of our growth strategy, however, is to acquire businesses. We would anticipate funding such activity through cash on hand, the issuance of debt, Common Stock, restricted stock units, and warrants for our Common Stock or a combination thereof. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Significant Developments 
 None. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A critical accounting estimate is an estimate that: (i) is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (ii) involved a significant level of estimation uncertainty and (iii) has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
 36 

There have been changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K related to the Company s acquisition of Amplex which closed June 15, 2024. We revised our critical policies relating to principles of consolidation, trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts, and revenue recognition. 
 Principles of Consolidation and Variable Interest Entities 
 We consolidate all entities that we control through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity VIE ). We use, and expect to continue to use, a combination of our equity ownership, governance rights and other contractual arrangements to control operations of these entities. However, these arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over these operations as would wholly owning these entities. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I of this quarterly report for information on variable interest entities. 
 Under the VIE model, we are required to perform an analysis as to whether we have a variable interest in an entity and whether the entity is a VIE. In evaluating whether we hold a variable interest, we review all of our financial relationships to determine whether we are exposed to the risks and rewards created and distributed by an entity. We hold indirect variable interests in the Red Bug Entities through our acquisition of Amplex. 
 If we have a variable interest in an entity, we further assess whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are assessed for consolidation under the voting interest model. The assessment of whether an entity is a VIE requires an evaluation of qualitative factors and, where applicable, quantitative factors. These judgments include: (a) determining whether the entity has sufficient equity at risk, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, lack the ability to make decisions that significantly affect the economic performance of the entity and (c) determining whether the entity is structured with disproportionate voting rights in relation to their equity interests. 
 For entities that are determined to be VIEs, we are required to consolidate those entities where we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder with (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the entity s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate our economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by us. At each reporting date, we determine whether any reconsideration events have occurred that require us to revisit the primary beneficiary analysis, and we will consolidate or deconsolidate accordingly. 
 We are the primary beneficiary of the Red Bug Entities, because we indirectly through Amplex have the power to direct activities of the entities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. Accordingly, we consolidate these entities. The assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs are presented gross in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on both consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs. 
 Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities under the voting interest model. Under the voting interest model, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest or other means. The Company consolidates Amplex under the voting interest model as it owns 56.5 of this entity. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP ). Management believes it has made all necessary adjustments so that the condensed consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and that estimates made in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which the Company is deemed to have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
 37 

Business Combinations 
 We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, to properly allocate the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and record any residual purchase price as goodwill in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . We identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and asset lives. These determinations will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods. Contingent consideration is initially recorded at its fair value at the acquisition date and is revalued every financial reporting date thereafter. Adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities after the completion of acquisition accounting are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. 
 If the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Once the measurement period ends, which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions to the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings. 
 All acquisition-related costs, other than the costs to issue debt or equity securities, are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. 
 Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit losses 
 Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, net of allowance for credit losses, if applicable, and are unsecured and do not bear interest. 
 The allowance for credit losses is based on the probability of future collection under the current expect credited loss impairment model under ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Assets . Under the CECL impairment model, we determine the allowance by applying a loss-rate method based on an aging schedule using our historical loss rate. We also consider reasonable and supportable current information in determining its estimated loss rates, such as macroeconomic trends or other factors including customers credit risk and historical loss experience. There is significant judgment applied in estimating the allowance for credit losses. These assumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant changes based on the current environment. 
 The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis. Account balances are written off after all means of collection are exhausted and the balance is deemed uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance. Changes in the allowance are recorded as adjustments to bad debt expense in the period incurred. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 We record discontinued operations when the disposal of a separately identified business unit constitutes a strategic shift in our operations, as defined in ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations . 
 Contingent Liability 
 We have been, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an estimated loss for a contingency in our condensed consolidated financial statements for these matters as a charge to income when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information becomes known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. In determining whether a loss should be recorded or adjusted, management evaluates several factors, including advice from outside legal counsel, in order to estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably 
 38 

estimated, a liability is not recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements. If a loss is probable but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the loss contingency and an estimate of possible loss or range of loss (unless such an estimate cannot be made). Changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year. We do not recognize gain contingencies until they are realized. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Refer to Note 2 and Note 12 of our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy: 
 Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
 Level 2 inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
 Level 3 inputs: Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers. 
 Certain of our assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value either on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and are presented with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, such as Term Loan Advances, dissenting shareholders liability and contingent liability. Our non-financial assets such as property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Fair value adjustments are made to these non-financial assets, on a nonrecurring basis, during the period an impairment charge is recognized, as applicable. 
 Certain of our financial instruments are carried at fair value and are presented within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, such as money market funds included within cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the carrying amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, materials and supplies, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Refer to Note 2 for additional information. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition , we recognize revenue from contracts with customers using the five-step model: 
 1. identify the customer contract; 

2. identify performance obligations that are distinct; 

3. determine the transaction price; 

4. allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and 

5. recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. 

We generate revenues primarily from our wireless internet services, fiber internet services, and other services. 
 Identify the customer contract 
 A customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both us and our customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable. Specifically, we obtain written/electronic signatures on contracts and purchase orders, if said purchase orders are issued in the normal course of business by the customer. 
 39 

Identify performance obligations that are distinct 
 A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. 
 Determine the transaction price 
 The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies. 
 Allocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations 
 The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices SSP of the goods or services being provided to the customer. Our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations, for which we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific piece of equipment or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. 
 Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied 
 Revenues from wireless and fiber internet, VOIP services, and video streaming services are recognized ratably as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Revenues from equipment sales are recognized when control transfers to the customer, which occurs upon delivery. 
 Customers are billed in advance for services to be provided in the upcoming month. Once billed, payment from customers is due 30 days from the invoice date. Our agreements with our customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. 
 Sales and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. 
 We fulfill obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. There are no contract assets related to performance under the contract. We are contractually entitled to invoice in advance for services to be provided in the future. Accordingly, accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. We recognize deferred revenue when consideration has been billed or received in advance of our satisfaction of our performance obligation(s).

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Not Applicable. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). 
 Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of September 30, 2024, because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to non-routine transactions which lead to the correction of errors with respect to the (a) application of complex technical accounting standards related to the presentation and measurement of certain equity and liability instruments from the re-domestication and (b) measurement of redeemable noncontrolling interest, certain acquired assets and deferred tax liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a controlling interest in Amplex. 
 The Company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 
 While the Company believes that its efforts for remediation, once implemented, will improve the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, these remediation efforts have been ongoing and will require more time to operate for management to be able to conclude that the design is effective to remediate the material weakness identified. The Company may conclude that additional measures will be necessary to remediate the material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, which may necessitate additional evaluation and implementation time. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 In connection with the weaknesses noted above management is in the process of establishing and is refining its internal procedures and controls to ensure the accounting around future complex transactions are thoroughly reviewed with external consultants specializing in the specific transactions identified. 
 Other than as described above, during the most recent fiscal quarter, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See the disclosure in Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which disclosure is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the Risk Factor below and the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, especially in the section entitled PART I Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results of operations. The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on Amplex. 
 Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on Amplex. A substantial portion of the Amplex revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States affect demand for Amplex products and services and have a negative impact on results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact Amplex customers discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of the Amplex services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. 
 Amplex is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. 
 Amplex is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act and Federal Communications Commission FCC regulations and policies affect significant aspects of Amplex. Federal agencies are considering adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband. States and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Any of these regulations could significantly affect the business, legal and compliance costs of Amplex. In addition, United States regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact Amplex. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may adversely impact the Amplex business by increasing Amplex costs, increasing competition, or imposing additional restrictions on Amplex, some of which may be significant and/or limiting the ability of Amplex to offer services in a manner that would maximize its revenue potential. 
 Legislative and regulatory changes have in the past, and could in the future, include, for example, the reclassification of Internet services as regulated telecommunications services or other utility-style regulation of Internet services; restrictions on how Amplex manages its Internet access services and networks; the adoption of new customer service or service quality requirements for Amplex Internet access services; the adoption of new privacy restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of certain customer information by Amplex; new data security and cybersecurity mandates that could result in additional network and information security and cyber incident reporting requirements for Amplex; new restraints on the discretion of Amplex over programming decisions; new restrictions on the rates Amplex charges to consumers for one or more of the services or equipment options offered by Amplex; and increases in government-administered broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of Amplex facilities. 
 42 

The broadband services of Amplex are subject to a number of regulations and commitments. The FCC frequently considers imposing new broadband-related regulations. States and localities also periodically consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding broadband affordability. New broadband regulations, if adopted, may have adverse effects on Amplex. Amplex may also become subject to additional broadband-related commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on Amplex.
