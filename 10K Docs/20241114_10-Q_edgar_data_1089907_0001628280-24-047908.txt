 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1. 
 reportable segments: Finance Receivables and Pharmaceutical Development. We evaluate and invest in a broad range of healthcare related companies and products with innovative intellectual property, including the biotechnology, medical device, medical diagnostics and related tools, animal health and pharmaceutical industries (collectively, life sciences ). We allocate capital to each segment in order to generate income through the sales of life science products by third parties and related earned income sources. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had full-time employees. 
 The Company has net operating loss carryforwards NOLs and believes that the ability to utilize these NOLs is an important and substantial asset. 
 As of November 7, 2024, the Company and its partners have executed transactions with different parties under its specialty finance strategy, funding an aggregate of million in various financial products across the life science sector. The Company s portfolio includes senior and subordinated debt backed by royalties and synthetic royalties paid by companies in the life science sector, and purchased royalties generated by sales of life science products and related intellectual property. 
 During 2019, we commenced our Pharmaceutical Development segment with the acquisition of Enteris BioPharma, Inc. Enteris ). Enteris is a clinical development and manufacturing organization providing development services to pharmaceutical partners as well as innovative formulation solutions built around its proprietary oral drug delivery technologies, the Peptelligence platform. We seek to generate income by providing customers pharmaceutical development, formulation and manufacturing services as well as licensing its internally developed intellectual property. 
 With an effective date of April 21, 2023, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a strategic partner under which we would be the exclusive provider of certain contract development and manufacturing organization ("CDMO") services to its customers. Fee revenue generated as a result of this agreement is presented as pharmaceutical development revenue on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income and is accounted for in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as described under Revenue Recognition below. 
 With an effective date of January 1, 2024, we entered into an Option and Asset Purchase Agreement with the same strategic partner on March 14, 2024, which granted the partner an exclusive option to acquire certain of Enteris assets related to its business of providing CDMO services to third parties, subject to certain exclusions. The partner must exercise the option by or before January 1, 2026.

U.S.-based business segments: its specialty finance and asset management business offering customized financing solutions to a broad range of life-sciences companies ("Finance Receivable segment"), and its business offering CDMO services to pharmaceutical partners as well as innovative formulation solutions built around its proprietary oral drug delivery technologies, the Peptelligence platform Pharmaceutical Development segment ). 
 
 Correction of Errors in Previously Issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 The Company identified certain errors that affected the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The errors corrected revenue recognition for three investments which related to a holdback liability that should not have been recorded to revenue, interest income recognized when no payment was expected in the period, a revaluation write-up that was not factored into the amortization schedule, and royalty forecasted cash flows that did not reflect the most current estimates for the respective periods. The errors were determined to be immaterial to the prior period's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and did not warrant restatement and reissuance of the previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the Company recorded corrections to the prior quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and the financial statements will be revised the next time they are presented as comparative information in future filings. The Company based its qualitative and quantitative analysis on SEC Staff s Accounting Bulletins Topic 1.M, "Materiality and Topic 1.N, Considering the Effects of Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements."

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is management's estimate of the amount of expected credit losses over the life of the loan portfolio, or the amount of amortized cost basis not expected to be collected, at the balance sheet date. This estimate encompasses information about historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Determining the amount of the ACL is complex and requires extensive judgment by management about matters that are inherently uncertain. Given the current level of economic uncertainty, the complexity of the ACL estimate and level of management judgment required, we believe it is possible that the ACL estimate could change, potentially materially, in future periods. Changes in the ACL may result from changes in current economic conditions, our economic forecast, and circumstances not currently known to us that may impact the financial condition and operations of our borrowers, among other factors. 
 Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for groups of loans that share similar risk characteristics. For finance receivables that do not share similar risk characteristics with other finance receivables, expected credit losses are estimated on an individual basis. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual terms of the finance receivables, adjusted for expected prepayments and unfunded commitments, generally excluding extensions and modifications. The loan portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. 
 The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, as amended, on January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective approach method. The implementation of ASU 2016-13 also impacted the Company's ACL on unfunded loan commitments, as the ACL now represents expected credit losses over the contractual life of commitments not identified as unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The reserve for unfunded commitments is estimated using the same reserve or coverage rates calculated on collectively evaluated loans following the application of a funding rate to the amount of the unfunded commitment. The funding rate represents management's estimate of the amount of the current unfunded commitment that will be funded over the remaining contractual life of the commitment and is based on historical data. On January 1, 2023, the Company recorded an adjustment for unfunded commitments of million for the adoption of ASU 2016-13. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company has a million liability for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures related to unfunded commitments, with this liability included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Please refer to Note 6 for further information on the Company's unfunded commitments. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - methodology update during the three months ended June 30, 2024 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company revised its methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses to be more directly tied to the individual risk ratings, as determined by management, of finance receivables. This resulted in a re-allocation of the existing allowance and did not have a material impact on the total allowance for credit losses amount. Previously, the Company's quarterly assessment of the allowance included two portfolio pools: Term Loans and Royalties. After the change in methodology effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, these pools are further broken down into individual risk ratings applied to each investment to allow for a more precise method for calculating the allowance for credit losses.

No impact to unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-Accrual Finance Receivables 
 The Company originates finance receivables to companies primarily in the life sciences sector. This concentration of credit exposes the Company to a higher degree of risk associated with this sector. 
 On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the carrying value of its finance receivables. Recognition of income is suspended, and the finance receivable is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable. This evaluation is generally based on delinquency information, an assessment of the borrower s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. The Company would generally place term loans on nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain and they are 90 days past due for interest or principal, unless the term loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. When placed on nonaccrual, the Company would reverse any accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and amortization of any net deferred fees is suspended. Generally, the Company would return a term loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the terms of the credit agreement.

 Credit Quality of Finance Receivables 
 The Company evaluates all finance receivables on a quarterly basis and assigns a risk rating based upon management s assessment of the borrower s ability and likelihood of repayment. The assessment is subjective and based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, financial strength of borrowers and operating results of the underlying business. The credit risk analysis and rating assignment is performed quarterly in conjunction with the Company's assessment of its allowance for credit losses. The Company uses the following definitions for its risk ratings for Term Loans: 
 1: Borrower performing well below Company expectations, and the borrower's ability to raise sufficient capital to operate its business or repay debt is highly in question. Finance receivables rated a 1 are on non-accrual and are at an elevated risk for principal impairment. 
 2: Borrower performing below plan, and the loan-to-value is generally worse than at the time of underwriting. Borrower has limited access to additional capital to operate its business. Finance receivables rated a 2 are generally on non-accrual, and while no loss of impairment is anticipated, there is potential for future principal impairment. 
 3: Borrower performing in-line-to-modestly below Company expectations, and loan-to-value is similar to slightly worse than at the time of underwriting. Borrower has demonstrated access to capital markets. 
 4: Borrower performing in-line-to-modestly above Company expectations and loan-to-value similar or modestly better than underwriting case. Borrower has demonstrated access to capital markets. 
 5: Borrower performing in excess of Company expectations, and loan-to-value is better than at time of origination. 
 The Company uses an internal credit rating system which rates each Royalty on a color scale of Green to Red, with Green typically indicative of a Royalty that is exceeding base underwritten case, Yellow indicates a Royalty performing in-line with underwritten plan, and Red reflective of underperformance relative to plan. Royalties rated as Red are generally classified as non-accrual.

 Contingent Consideration 
 During fiscal year 2019 the Company recorded contingent consideration related to the 2019 acquisition of Enteris and sharing of certain milestone and royalties due to Enteris pursuant to the License Agreement. Contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, with changes in the estimated fair value recognized in earnings. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, it was determined the milestones and royalties pursuant to the License Agreement would not be realized as a result of non-viability of the product covered by the License Agreement. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the liability for contingent consideration, previously held at its estimated fair value of million, should be . The write-off of this contingent consideration liability resulted in a gain of million during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and is included in the "Change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration" caption of our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Unfunded Commitments 
 Per the terms of the royalty purchase or credit agreements, unfunded commitments are contingent upon reaching an established revenue threshold or other performance metrics on or before a specified date or period of time, and in the case of loan transactions, are subject to being advanced as long as an event of default does not exist. As of September 30, 2024, SWK had million of unfunded commitments. 
 Litigation 
 The Company is involved in, or has been involved in, arbitrations or various other legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of its business. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, balance sheets and cash flows due to defense costs, and divert management resources. The Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these claims and other proceedings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is not involved in any arbitration and/or other legal proceeding that it expects to have a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Indemnification 
 As permitted by Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving in such capacity, or in other capacities at the Company s request. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any such amounts. As a result of the Company s insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is insignificant. Accordingly, the Company had no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Marketable Investments 
 If active market prices are available, fair value measurement is based on quoted active market prices and, accordingly, these securities are classified as Level 1. If active market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, such as prices for similar assets or broker quotes utilizing observable inputs, and accordingly these securities are classified as Level 2. If market prices are not available and there are no observable inputs, then fair value would be estimated by using valuation models including discounted cash flow methodologies, commonly used option-pricing models and broker quotes. Such securities are classified as Level 3, if the valuation models and broker quotes are based on inputs that are unobservable in the market. If fair value is based on broker quotes, the Company checks the validity of received prices based on comparison to prices of other similar assets and market data such as relevant benchmark indices. Available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, while securities with no readily available fair market value are not, but estimates of fair value are reflected below.

 Enteris Exclusive Option and Asset Purchase Agreement 
 With an effective date of January 1, 2024, we entered into an exclusive option and asset purchase agreement with a strategic partner on March 14, 2024 which granted the partner an exclusive option to acquire certain of Enteris assets related to its business of providing clinical manufacturing and development services. The partner must exercise the option by or before January 1, 2026. In exchange for the exclusive purchase option the partner is to provide consideration in the form of an "option fee" and "guaranteed revenue payments." 
 The option fee is broken into components: A low-single digit million fee due within business days of executing the agreement; and should the option not be exercised by the first anniversary of the effective date, an additional low-single digit million fee will be due at that time. The first option fee was paid in April 2024. Option fee payments will be included in deferred income until the earlier of term expiration or exercise of the purchase option. Should the partner exercise the purchase option, any option fee payments made will be applied towards the purchase price. 
 The guaranteed revenue payments include components: A mid-single digit million guaranteed revenue payment in 2024 and a mid-single digit million guaranteed revenue payment in 2025. The revenue is to be derived by the partner under an existing collaboration agreement, and the partner is to pay the difference should the minimum amount not be met each year. Each year's guaranteed revenue amount is to be paid in installments semi-annually each year. Should revenue exceed the 2024 or 2025 guaranteed revenue amounts after receiving a difference payment in the first half of the year, we must repay the partner the amount of such overpayment. Guaranteed revenue of million was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 reportable segments: Finance Receivables and Pharmaceutical Development, and each are individually managed and provide separate services. Revenues by segment represent revenues earned on the services offered within each segment. The Company does not report assets by reportable segment, nor does the Company report results by geographic region, as these metrics are not used by the Company s chief executive officer in assessing performance or allocating resources to the segments. 
 Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes. Management uses this measure of profit (loss) to evaluate segment performance because the Company believes this measure is indicative of performance trends and the overall earnings potential of each segment. The Company does not report assets by reportable segment, as this metric is not used by the Company's CEO in assessing performance or allocating resources to the segments.

 Revenues 
 
 Revenues increased to 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.4 million increase in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 0.9 million increase in Finance Receivables segment revenue and a 0.3 million increase in Pharmaceutical Development segment revenue. The 0.9 million increase in Finance Receivables segment revenue was primarily due to an increase of 2.1 million in interest and fees earned due to funding new and existing loans offset by 1.2 million decrease in interest, fees and royalties earned on finance receivables that were paid off during the period. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Our provision for credit losses is established through charges or credits to income in the form of the provision in order to bring our allowance for credit losses for loans and unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by management. We recognized a net provision for credit losses of 1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.2 million during three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest accrued on our revolving line of credit, 9.00 Senior Notes due 2027, unused line of credit and maintenance fees, as well as amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense increased to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.9 million increase in interest expense was due to issuing approximately 32.9 million of Notes in an underwritten public offering in October of 2023. See Note 5 for further information on the Notes, new Credit Agreement, and Prior Credit Agreement. 
 Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, Research and Development Expense 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturing, research and development expense remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the previous year resulting in an immaterial change in total activity.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 The 0.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of a decrease in amortization expense related to no longer amortizing intangible assets related to the Cara license as the intangible assets were fully impaired during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Amortization expense is aligned with the expected future cash flows of the intangible assets. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation; stock-based compensation and related costs for management, staff and Board; legal and audit expenses; and corporate governance expenses. General and administrative expenses stayed flat at 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulting in an immaterial change in total activity between the periods. 
 Other Income (expense), Net 
 Other income, net increased to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from other expense, net of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.5 million increase includes gains on foreign currency transactions and unrealized gains on warrants related to changes in fair value of warrant assets. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized 0.9 million of income tax expense, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized an income tax benefit of 0.4 million. Income tax expense increased period over period due to the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of 1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the Company's effective tax rate, which was 22.8 and 13.6 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in millions 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Revenues 32.6 27.9 4.7 Provision (benefit) for credit losses 10.8 (0.5) 11.3 Loss on impairment of intangible assets 5.8 5.8 Interest expense 3.5 0.7 2.8 Pharmaceutical manufacturing, research and development expense 1.6 2.8 (1.2) Change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration (4.9) (4.9) Depreciation and amortization expense 1.2 1.9 (0.7) General and administrative expense 8.6 8.5 0.1 Other income (expense), net 3.7 (0.3) 4.0 Income tax expense 2.2 1.0 1.2 Net income 7.6 13.0 (5.4) 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Revenues increased to 32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 4.7 million increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a 3.7 million increase in Finance Receivables segment revenue and a 1.1 million increase in Pharmaceutical Development segment revenue. The 3.7 million increase in Finance Receivables segment revenue was primarily due to a 6.3 million increase in interest and fees earned due to funding new and existing loans offset by 2.4 million decrease in interest, fees and royalties earned on finance receivables that were paid off during the period. The increase in the Pharmaceutical Development segment was primarily due to the Aptar collaboration agreement. 
 
 Provision (Benefit) for Credit Losses 
 Our provision for credit losses is established through charges or credits to income in the form of the provision in order to bring our allowance for credit losses for loans and unfunded commitments to a level deemed appropriate by management. We recognized a net provision for credit losses of 10.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 0.5 million benefit during nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Most of the change was related to a 8.1 million impairment on the Trio loan and 2.2 million impairment on the Exeevo loan that were included within the provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the allowance for credit losses. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest accrued on our revolving line of credit, 9.00 Senior Notes due 2027, unused line of credit and maintenance fees, as well as amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense increased to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.8 million increase in interest expense was mainly due to issuing approximately 32.9 million of Notes in an underwritten public offering in October of 2023. See Note 5 for further information on the Notes, new Credit Agreement, and Prior Credit Agreement. 
 Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, Research and Development Expense 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturing, research and development expense decreased from 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The 1.2 million decrease was primarily due to a reduction in research and development and clinical trial expenditures related to cancelled projects during the period and bonus expense during the previous year. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 The 0.7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consists of a decrease in amortization expense related to no longer amortizing intangible assets related to the Cara license as the intangible assets were fully impaired during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Amortization expense is aligned with the expected future cash flows of the intangible assets. See Note 4 for more information on the impairment of the Cara license. 
 32 

General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation; stock-based compensation and related costs for management, staff and Board; legal and audit expenses; and corporate governance expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulting in an immaterial change in total activity between the periods. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net increased to 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from an expense of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 4.0 million increase includes a 2.5 million gain on revaluation related to the Iluvien royalty after a contractual re-negotiation, a 1.0 million gain on unrealized foreign currency transactions, a gain of 0.5 million due to the exercise of warrants. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we recognized 2.2 million and 1.0 million of income tax expense, respectively. Income tax expense increased period over period due to the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of 1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the Company's effective tax rate to 22.8 as of September 30, 2024 from 13.6 for the same period in the prior year. 
 33 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 17.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to 5.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The primary driver of the 12.0 million increase in our cash balance was 57.0 million of interest, fees, principal and royalty payments received on our finance receivables and 3.3 million of cash receipts from pharmaceutical development revenues. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by 18.6 million of investment funding, net of deferred fees and origination expenses, a net credit facility payment of 12.4 million, a payroll and benefits expense of 4.3 million, 8.0 million of payments on accounts payable, and share repurchases of 5.2 million. 
 We entered into a 45.0 million revolving credit facility in June 2023 with First Horizon Bank. The Credit Agreement provides for one or more incremental increases not to exceed 80.0 million, subject to the consent of the Agent and each Lender, at any time prior to the Commitment Termination Date. On October 10, 2023, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement pursuant to which Woodforest National Bank was added as a lender under the Credit Agreement for an aggregate commitment of 15.0 million, thereby increasing the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement from 45.0 million to 60.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding amount under the new Credit Agreement, and 55.0 million was available for borrowing. The 60.0 million Credit Agreement contains a 5.0 million liquidity covenant, bringing the total amount available for borrowing to 55.0 million. 
 
 Our Prior Credit Agreement with Cadence Bank was terminated in connection with the establishment of the new Credit Agreement (please refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Credit Agreement with First Horizon Bank). 
 
 On October 3, 2023, the Company completed a registered underwritten public offering of 30.0 million of the Notes. On October 27, 2023, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional approximately 3.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature on January 31, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, and will bear interest at a rate of 9.00 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year and at maturity, commencing on December 31, 2023. The Company received net proceeds after discounts, commissions, expenses and fees, of approximately 30.6 million. See Note 5 for more information. 
 
 Primary Driver of Cash Flow 
 Our ability to generate cash in the future depends primarily upon our success in implementing our Finance Receivables business model of generating income by providing capital to a broad range of life science companies, institutions and inventors, as well as the success of our Pharmaceutical Development segment. We generate income primarily from four sources: 
 
 1. Primarily owning or financing through debt investments, royalties generated by the sales of life science products and related intellectual property; 
 
 2. Receiving interest and other income by advancing capital in the form of secured debt to companies in the life science sector; 
 
 3. Pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and licensing activities utilizing the Peptelligence platform; and 
 
 4. To a lesser extent, realizing capital appreciation from equity-related investments in the life science sector. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our finance receivables portfolio contains 255.9 million of net finance receivables and 0.8 million of marketable investments. We expect these assets to generate positive cash flows in 2024. We continuously monitor the short and long-term financial position of our finance receivables portfolio. In addition, the majority of our finance receivables portfolio are debt instruments that carry floating interest rates. Changes in interest rates, including the levels of the underlying reference rates may affect the interest income for debt instruments with floating rates. We believe we are well positioned to benefit should market interest rates rise in the future. 
 
 We continue to evaluate multiple attractive opportunities that, if consummated, we believe would similarly generate additional income. Since the timing of any investment is difficult to predict, our Finance Receivables segment may not be able to generate positive cash flow above what our existing assets are expected to produce in 2024. We do not assume any near-term repayments from borrowers, and as a result, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 34 

In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage partner companies requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. 
 
 The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the partner company defaults, and the value of any existing collateral becomes worthless. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 39.0 million in unfunded commitments. Please refer to Item 1., Financial Statements, Note 6 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company s commitments and contingencies. 
 
 35 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were deposited in accounts at well capitalized financial institutions. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 approximated its carrying value. 
 
 Investment and Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flow. 
 As we seek to provide capital to a broad range of life science companies, institutions and investors with the majority of our finance receivables portfolio paying interest based on floating interest rates with a reference rate floor, our net investment income is dependent, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and the rate at which we lend those funds to third parties. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by providing capital at variable interest rates. We do not currently engage in any interest rate hedging activities. We constantly monitor our portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any of our investments. 
 We entered into a revolving credit facility. As we borrow funds to make additional investments, our income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we have debt outstanding, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our income, especially to the extent we continue to hold fixed rate investments. We generally seek to mitigate this risk by pricing our debt investments with floating interest rates to maintain the spread of our portfolio over the cost of leverage. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, which we have not done. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our investment income, net of borrowing expenses. 
 Inflation 
 
 Certain of our partner companies may be impacted by inflation. If such partner companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs along to their customers, it could adversely affect their results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans. In addition, any projected future decreases in our partner companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce carrying value of our net assets. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 In connection with the preparation of this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 36 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved in, or have been involved in, arbitrations or various other legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of our business. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these claims and other proceedings. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, balance sheets and cash flows due to defense costs, and divert management resources. Currently, we are not involved in any arbitration and/or other legal proceeding that we expect to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Information regarding the Company s risk factors appears in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024. There are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
 On May 31, 2022, the Board authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 10.0 million of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock. The previous repurchase periods under this program were July 1, 2022 through May 15, 2023 and May 16, 2023 through May 15, 2024 (the "Prior Repurchase Programs"). 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company announced that the Board had authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10.0 million of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock from time-to-time until May 16, 2025, through a trading plan established in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the Current Repurchase Program ). The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the Repurchase Program will depend on several factors, including the constraints specified in the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, price, and general market conditions. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the Repurchase Program. Our Board may also suspend or discontinue the Repurchase Program at any time, in its sole discretion. The purchase period for the Repurchase Program is May 16, 2024 through May 16, 2025. 
 
 The table below summarizes information about our purchases of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
