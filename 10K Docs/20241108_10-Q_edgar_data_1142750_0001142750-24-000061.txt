 Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 22, 2024 2023 Annual Report ). Certain statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. We undertake no obligation to update the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report. References in this Quarterly Report to AMN Healthcare, the Company, we, us and our refer to AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. 
 Overview of Our Business 
 
 We provide technology-enabled healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services to healthcare organizations across the nation. The Company provides access to a comprehensive network of healthcare professionals through its recruitment strategies and breadth of career opportunities. The Company helps providers optimize their workforce to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. The Company s total talent solutions include vendor neutral and managed services programs, clinical and interim healthcare leaders, temporary staffing, permanent placement, executive search, vendor management systems, recruitment process outsourcing, predictive modeling, language services, revenue cycle solutions, and other services. Clients include acute-care hospitals, community health centers and clinics, physician practice groups, retail and urgent care centers, home health facilities, schools and many other healthcare settings. 
 We conduct business through three reportable segments: (1) nurse and allied solutions, (2) physician and leadership solutions, and (3) technology and workforce solutions. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded revenue of 687.5 million, as compared to 853.5 million for the same period last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded revenue of 2,249.1 million, as compared to 2,971.0 million for the same period last year. 
 Nurse and allied solutions segment revenue comprised 60 and 70 of total consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Through our nurse and allied solutions segment, we provide hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and schools with a comprehensive set of staffing solutions, including direct, vendor neutral, and managed services solutions in which we manage and staff all the temporary and permanent nursing and allied staffing needs, as well as the revenue cycle management needs, of a client. A majority of our placements in this segment are under our managed services solution. 
 Physician and leadership solutions segment revenue comprised 25 and 17 of total consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Through our physician and leadership solutions segment, we place physicians of all specialties, as well as dentists and advanced practice providers, with clients on a temporary basis, generally as independent contractors. We also recruit physicians and healthcare leaders for permanent placement and place interim leaders and executives across all healthcare settings. The interim healthcare leaders and executives we place are typically placed on contracts with assignment lengths ranging from a few days to one year. 
 Technology and workforce solutions segment revenue comprised 15 and 13 of total consolidated revenue for both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Through our technology and workforce solutions segment, we provide hospitals and other healthcare facilities with a range of workforce solutions, including: (1) language services, (2) software-as-a-service SaaS )-based VMS technologies through which our clients can self-manage the procurement of contingent clinical labor and their internal float pool, (3) workforce optimization services that include consulting, data analytics, predictive modeling, and SaaS-based scheduling technology, and (4) recruitment process outsourcing services in which we recruit, hire and/or onboard permanent clinical and nonclinical positions on behalf of our clients. 
 Operating Metrics 
 
 In addition to our consolidated and segment financial results, we monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our results of operations and financial condition and make strategic decisions. We believe this information is useful in understanding our operational performance and trends affecting our businesses. 
 Average travelers on assignment represents the average number of nurse and allied healthcare professionals on assignment during the period, which is used by management as a measure of volume in our nurse and allied solutions segment; 
 Bill rates represent the hourly straight-time rates that we bill to clients, which are an indicator of labor market trends and costs within our nurse and allied solutions segment; 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 Billable hours represent the number of hours worked by our healthcare professionals that we are able to bill on client engagements, which are used by management as a measure of volume in our nurse and allied solutions segment; 
 Days filled is calculated by dividing total locum tenens hours filled during the period by eight hours, which is used by management as a measure of volume in our locum tenens business within our physician and leadership solutions segment; 
 Revenue per day filled is calculated by dividing revenue of our locum tenens business by days filled for the period, which is an indicator of labor market trends and costs in our locum tenens business within our physician and leadership solutions segment; and 
 Minutes represent the time-based utilization of interpretation services that we are able to bill our clients, which are used by management as a measure of volume in our language services business within our technology and workforce solutions segment. 
 
 Recent Trends 
 Since the COVID-19 pandemic subsided, healthcare organizations have aggressively hired permanent staff and focused on cost containment and alternative staffing models that enabled them to reduce utilization of contingent labor. As a result, demand in our travel nurse business declined significantly and continues to remain below pre-pandemic levels. During the second quarter and through the third quarter, we have seen an increase in demand as measured by open orders, although it has not yet been realized in travelers on assignment. In our allied staffing business, demand continues to be above pre-pandemic levels and was up slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis and was up significantly year over year primarily from high demand in therapy and imaging. 
 For our nurse and allied solutions segment, in the third quarter we saw a decrease in overall staffing volume from prior year due to lower travel nurse demand in the second quarter and visa retrogression impacting international nurse staffing. Compared to the prior quarter, the average number of travelers on assignment in the third quarter was down due to the lower demand environment earlier in the year and schools seasonality. Bill rates in the third quarter were down modestly from the second quarter due to seasonal trends and continued client focus on cost savings. 
 In our physician and leadership solutions segment, demand for our locum tenens staffing business declined from the prior year though it was higher compared with the prior quarter. Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) continue to be the largest specialty for our locum tenens staffing business. Revenue per day filled increased in the third quarter as compared to the prior year. Demand for our interim leadership and search businesses continues to be below prior year as some healthcare organizations defer hiring decisions or increase insourcing. 
 In our technology and workforce solutions segment, our language services business continued to experience an increase in minutes from our existing clients and growth from new clients. Volumes in our VMS business followed similar trends as our travel nurse business as compared to the prior year. VMS bill rates in the third quarter were down sequentially and year over year. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to intangible assets purchased in a business combination, asset impairments, accruals for self-insurance, compensation and related benefits, accounts receivable, contingencies and litigation, contingent consideration earn-out liabilities associated with acquisitions, and income taxes. We base these estimates on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, our consolidated financial statements and future results of operations may be materially impacted. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 Annual Report.

 Results of Operations 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, selected unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue. Our results of operations include three reportable segments: (1) nurse and allied solutions, (2) physician and leadership solutions, and (3) technology and workforce solutions. The MSDR acquisition impacts the comparability of the results between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. See additional information in the accompanying Note (2), Acquisitions. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations.

Comparison of Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue . Revenue decreased 19 to 687.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 853.5 million for the same period in 2023, attributable to a decline in organic revenue across our segments with the greatest decline in our nurse and allied solutions segment. 
 Nurse and allied solutions segment revenue decreased 30 to 399.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 573.4 million for the same period in 2023. The 174.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to a 24 decrease in the average number of travelers on assignment, an approximately 8 decrease in the average bill rate, and a less than 1 decrease in average billable hours. 
 Physician and leadership solutions segment revenue increased 13 to 180.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 159.6 million for the same period in 2023. The 21.0 million increase was attributable to higher revenue in our locum tenens business, which was partially offset by lower revenue in our interim leadership, physician permanent placement and executive search businesses. Revenue in our locum tenens business grew 29.2 million (or 26 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to additional revenue of 32.8 million in connection with the MSDR acquisition and a 5 increase in the revenue per day filled on an organic basis, partially offset by an 8 decrease in the number of days filled on an organic basis. Our interim leadership business experienced a decline of 2.0 million (or 7 and our physician permanent placement and executive search businesses declined 6.1 million (or 38 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower demand. 
 Technology and workforce solutions segment revenue decreased 11 to 107.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 120.5 million for the same period in 2023. The 13.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to a decline within our VMS and outsourced solutions businesses, partially offset by growth within our language services business. Revenue for our VMS business declined 13.1 million (or 34 for similar reasons as nurse and allied solutions segment revenue and our outsourced solutions business experienced a decline of 8.4 million (or 77 primarily due to lower demand, while our language services business grew 8.6 million (or 13 primarily due to a 15 increase in minutes during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue under our MSP arrangements comprised approximately 44 and 51 of our consolidated revenue, 68 and 70 of our nurse and allied solutions segment revenue, 15 and 19 of our physician and leadership solutions segment revenue, and 3 and 2 of our technology and workforce solutions segment revenue, respectively. 
 
 Cost of Revenue . Cost of revenue, which consists predominantly of compensation, benefits, housing, travel and allowance costs for healthcare professionals and medically qualified interpreters, decreased 16 to 474.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 564.0 million for the same period in 2023. The 89.5 million decrease was attributable to a decline in our nurse and allied solutions segment, partially offset by increases in our physician and leadership solutions and technology and workforce solutions segments. The decrease in our nurse and allied solutions segment was primarily attributable to a 115.7 million decrease in clinician pay package costs, including housing, travel and allowances, primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in the average number of travelers on assignment. The increase in our physician and leadership solutions segment was driven by a 23.3 million increase in clinician pay package costs, primarily due to the MSDR acquisition. The increase in our technology and workforce solutions segment was primarily attributable to 2.7 million of higher compensation and benefits primarily due to the aforementioned increase in minutes in our language services business. Cost of revenue broken down among the reportable segments is as follows: 
 
 (In Thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Nurse and allied solutions 299,617 415,563 Physician and leadership solutions 129,570 106,248 Technology and workforce solutions 45,267 42,146 474,454 563,957 
 
 Gross Profit . Gross profit decreased 26 to 213.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 289.5 million for the same period in 2023, representing gross margins of 31.0 and 33.9 , respectively. The decline in consolidated gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to (1) lower margins in our nurse and allied solutions and physician and leadership solutions segments driven by compression in clinician pay packages, including housing, travel and allowances and (2) a lower margin in our technology and workforce solutions segment primarily due to a change in sales mix resulting from lower revenue in our higher-margin VMS business and higher revenue in our lower-margin language services business. The overall decline was partially offset by a change in sales mix resulting from lower revenue in our nurse and allied solutions segment. Gross margin by reportable segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 25.0 and 27.5 for nurse and allied solutions, 28.3 and 33.4 for physician and leadership solutions, and 57.9 and 65.0 for technology and workforce solutions, respectively. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .

The decrease in SG A expenses was primarily due to a 7.3 million decrease in professional services, legal and other expenses due to prudent expense management. The year-over-year increase in SG A expenses in our physician and leadership solutions segment was driven by 5.8 million of additional SG A expenses from the MSDR acquisition, partially offset by 4.6 million of lower segment expenses amid the decline in organic revenue. SG A expenses broken down among the reportable segments, unallocated corporate overhead, and share-based compensation are as follows: 
 (In Thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Nurse and allied solutions 64,641 74,981 Physician and leadership solutions 32,901 31,697 Technology and workforce solutions 22,249 29,225 Unallocated corporate overhead 24,335 27,196 Share-based compensation 5,555 306 149,681 163,405

 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses . Amortization expense decreased 2 to 22.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 22.6 million for the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to having more intangible assets fully amortized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by additional amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the MSDR acquisition. Depreciation expense (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of revenue) increased 14 to 19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.6 million for the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in purchased and developed hardware and software placed in service for our ongoing technology investments to support our tech-centric total talent solutions initiatives and to optimize our internal front and back-office systems. Additionally, 1.9 million and 1.6 million of depreciation expense for our language services business is included in cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest Expense, Net, and Other . Interest expense, net, and other was 14.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 11.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a higher average debt outstanding balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense was 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 22.2 million for the same period in 2023, reflecting effective income tax rates of 10 and 29 for these periods, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the recognition of a net discrete tax benefit of 2.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 1.4 million net discrete tax expense during the same period in 2023, in relation to income before income taxes of 7.8 million and 75.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We currently estimate our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 24 for 2024. The 10 effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differs from our estimated annual effective tax rate of 24 primarily due to certain discrete tax benefits recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, in relation to income before income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 In summary, our cash flows were:

 Historically, our primary liquidity requirements have been for acquisitions, working capital requirements, and debt service under our credit facilities and senior notes. We have funded these requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under our credit facilities and senior notes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, (1) 285.0 million was drawn with 444.6 million of available credit under our 750.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Senior Credit Facility ), (2) the aggregate principal amount of our 4.625 senior notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes outstanding was 500.0 million, and (3) the aggregate principal amount of our 4.000 senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes outstanding was 350.0 million. We describe in further detail our Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below), under which the Senior Credit Facility is governed, the 2027 Notes, and the 2029 Notes in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note (8), Notes Payable and Credit Agreement of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total of our contractual obligations under operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year was 52.7 million. We describe in further detail our operating lease arrangements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note (5), Leases of our 2023 Annual Report. We also have various obligations and working capital requirements, such as certain tax and legal matters, contingent consideration and other liabilities, that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. See additional information in the accompanying Note (7), Fair Value Measurement, Note (8), Income Taxes, Note (9), Commitments and Contingencies, and Note (10), Balance Sheet Details. 
 In addition to our cash requirements, we have a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, which does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. See additional information in the accompanying Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 We believe that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and liquidity requirements, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond. We intend to finance potential future acquisitions with cash provided from operations, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility or other borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement, bank loans, debt or equity offerings, or some combination of the foregoing.

 the effect of significant adverse adjustments to our insurance-related accruals on our balance sheet, which could decrease our earnings or increase our losses and negatively impact our cash flows. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary exposure to market risk was interest rate risk associated with our variable interest debt instruments and our investment portfolio. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would not have resulted in a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of September 30, 2024 would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio. For our investments that are classified as available-for-sale, unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Such unrealized gains or losses would be realized only if we sell the investments prior to maturity. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated substantially all of our revenue in the United States. Accordingly, we believe that our foreign currency risk is immaterial. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Information with respect to this item may be found in the accompanying Note (9), Commitments and Contingencies, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report. The risk factors described in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Factors we currently do not know, factors that we currently consider immaterial or factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 From time to time, we may repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors (the Board ). On November 1, 2016, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 150.0 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market. On November 10, 2021, February 17, 2022, June 15, 2022, and February 16, 2023, we announced increases to the repurchase program totaling 1,200.0 million. These increases brought the total authorization of the repurchase program to 1,350.0 million, of which 226.7 million remained as of September 30, 2024. Under the repurchase program announced on November 1, 2016 and the aforementioned increases (collectively, the Company Repurchase Program ), share repurchases may be made from time to time, depending on prevailing market conditions and other considerations. The Company Repurchase Program has no expiration date and may be discontinued or suspended at any time. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. We describe in further detail the Company Repurchase Program and the shares repurchased thereunder in Part II, Item 5, Market For Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note (10)(b), Capital Stock Treasury Stock set forth in our 2023 Annual Report.
