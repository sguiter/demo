These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders, the ability
of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to fund its activities through debt and equity financing
arrangements. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary financing to complete its objectives.

ITEM
 2. MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive
Overview 

We
are a blank check Company incorporated on August 17, 2005 as a Delaware corporation. We plan to effect a merger,
capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
On October 14, 2018 we had entered into a Letter of Intent with an unrelated third party. Except for this Letter of Intent, we
have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions,
directly or indirectly, with respect to identifying any business combination target. 

Except
as disclosed above, we have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated
any substantive discussions directly or indirectly, with respect to identifying any business combination target. 

Until
we complete an acquisition, we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity to fund our operations,
including the costs associated with being a public company. We are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third
party with respect to raising any additional capital. 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational
activities. We may not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination. There has been no
significant change in our financial condition and no material adverse change has occurred since October 31, 2020. We expect to
incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance),
as well as for due diligence expenses. 

On
July 1, 2021, the former President of the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with A9 Technologies and Holdings LLC,
a company controlled by the current President of the Company, to sell 166,988 shares of the Company s common stock. The
total shares sold under the stock purchase agreement represent 62 of the total shares outstanding. On June 10, 2021, A9 Technologies
and Holdings, LLC made a 45,000 non-refundable deposit towards the stock purchase, and on July 9, 2021, A9 Technologies and Holdings,
LLC made an additional non-refundable deposit of 13,850 towards amounts paid by the former President on behalf of the Company
subsequent to the date of the agreement. On September 29, 2021, A9 Technologies and Holdings, LLC made the final 405,000 payment
towards the stock purchase, which effected the close of the agreement. Upon closing of the Agreement, the former President of
the Company transferred 166,988 shares of the Company s common stock to A9 Technologies and Holdings, LLC, who then became
the majority shareholder. In addition, upon final payment being made, the former President of the Company transferred to A9 Technologies
and Holdings, LLC 117,076 of debt that was owed to the former President of the Company at the time of transfer. 

On
October 7, 2021, Mr. Atlidakis resigned as an officer and director of the Company and Mr. Paras Shah was appointed as the Chief
Executive Officer and a director of the Company. 

On
January 12, 2022, the Company changed its name from The Diamond Cartel Inc. to Alexander Tech Corp. 

As
of July 31, 2024, we owed A9 Technologies and Holdings, LLC 283,930 for a transfer of debt from the former President of the Company
and expenses incurred on our behalf. The amount we owe A9 Technologies and Holdings, LLC, is non-interest bearing, unsecured,
and due on demand. 

As
of July 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. 

See
Note 3 to our financial statements included as part of this report for a description of our critical accounting policies and the
potential impact of the adoption of any new accounting pronouncements.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

A
critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is the ability to obtain additional capital through
additional equity and/or debt financing. We do not anticipate generating sufficient positive internal operating cash flow until
such time as we can deliver our products to market and generate substantial revenues, which may take the next full year to fully
realize, if ever. In the event we cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to significantly
curtail our operations. This would materially impact our ability to continue operations.

For
the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of 10,900 and at July 31, 2024, had a working capital deficit
of 316,274. Since inception we had not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During
the three-months ended July 31, 2024, we primarily relied upon advances and loans from related parties to fund our operations.
The Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing day-to-day operations and its corporate
overhead. We had 10,335 in cash at July 31, 2024, compared to 10,459 in cash at April 30, 2024. We had total liabilities of
 326,609 at July 31, 2024 compared to 317,253 at April 30, 2024. 

Our
current cash flow is not sufficient to meet our monthly expenses of approximately 3,000 and to fund future research and development
adequately. We intend to rely on additional debt financing, loans from existing stockholders and private placements of common
stock for additional funding, however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. We do not have material
commitments for future capital expenditures. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain short-term financing,
or that sources of such financing, if any, will continue to be available, and if available, that they will be on favorable terms.

to an increase in consulting and professional fees.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of
these policies is included in note 3 of our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical
experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

ITEM
 4. CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the direction and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive and
Chief Financial Officer, the Company has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures as of July 31, 2024. The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in its periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching its desired disclosure control objectives. Based
on the evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of July 31, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the period ended July 31, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal controls that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
