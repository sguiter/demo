patients from clinical sites across countries. Eligible participants included adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, with or without the use of long-term prophylaxis, and evaluated all attack severities and locations. The clinical trial met all primary and key secondary endpoints and demonstrated a safety profile that was similar to placebo. In June 2024, the Company filed a New Drug Application NDA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA seeking marketing approval of sebetralstat as the first oral, on-demand therapy for HAE. In August 2024, the Company was notified that the FDA has accepted the NDA filing for review, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act PDUFA notification date of June 17, 2025. Also in August 2024, the European Medicines Agency EMA validated the submission of the Company's Marketing Authorization Application MAA for sebetralstat. This application is currently being reviewed by the EMA s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP under the centralized licensing procedure for all 27 Member States of the European Union, as well as the EEA countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. In September 2024, the Company announced MAA submissions to the regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, and Singapore via the Access Consortium framework for which KalVista has obtained a four-way sharing agreement by the Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency, Swissmedic, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and Health Sciences Authority. The Access Consortium is designed to maximize regulatory collaboration across countries and support a timely review process. The Company also is preparing a planned Japanese New Drug Application JNDA filing with the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. The Company s headquarters is currently located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with additional offices and research activities located in Porton Down, United Kingdom; Salt Lake City, Utah; Zug, Switzerland; and Tokyo, Japan. In July 2024, the Company entered into a new headquarters lease for approximately square feet of office and laboratory space in Framingham, Massachusetts, which will commence in early 2025 with an expected initial lease term of approximately . The Company intends to sublease the current headquarters to third parties after the move to the new facility is completed. Liquidity The Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to research and development, including preclinical and clinical trials of sebetralstat. The Company has not completed the development of any product candidates or commenced commercial operations. Pharmaceutical drug product candidates, like those being developed by the Company, require approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. There can be no assurance that any product candidate will receive the necessary approvals and any failure to receive approval or delay in approval may have a material adverse impact on the Company s business and financial results. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry with development and commercial operations, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties associated with: obtaining regulatory approval of a late-stage product candidate; identifying, acquiring or in-licensing additional products or product candidates; pharmaceutical product development and the inherent uncertainty of clinical success; the challenges of protecting and enhancing intellectual property rights; and complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

million and million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company does not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until it obtains regulatory approval for, and commercializes, one of its current or future product candidates. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and it expects those losses to increase as it continues the development of, and seeks regulatory approvals for, product candidates, and begins to commercialize any approved products. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry with development and commercial operations, and it may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect its business. The Company currently anticipates that, based upon its operating plans and existing capital resources, it has sufficient funding to operate for at least the next twelve months. The Company may seek to finance future cash needs through equity offerings, debt financing, corporate partnerships and product sales. In the event of failure to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates, the Company will not be able to generate product sales, which will have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects.

In computing diluted earnings per share, common share equivalents are not considered in periods in which a net loss is reported, as the inclusion of the common share equivalents would be anti-dilutive. As a result, there is no difference between the Company s basic and diluted loss per share for the periods presented. The weighted average number of common shares used in the basic and diluted net loss per common share calculations includes the weighted-average pre-funded warrants outstanding during the period as they are exercisable at any time for nominal cash consideration.

The Company has classified all of its available-for-sale investment securities, including those with maturities beyond one year, as current assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the highly liquid nature of the investment securities and because these investment securities are considered available for use in current operations. As of October 31, 2024, unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were insignificant. The Company has t recognized an allowance for credit losses on any securities in an unrealized loss position a s of October 31, 2024, and April 30, 2024.

Indemnification: In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnification. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves future claims that may be made against the Company but have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. However, the Company may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. amounts associated with such indemnifications have been recorded to date. Contingencies: From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business activities. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. There were contingent liabilities requiring accrual at October 31, 2024 .

Under the terms of the synthetic royalty financing agreement, the Subsidiary received an upfront payment of million in exchange for tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of sebetralstat, as follows: on annual net sales up to and including million (the First Tier Royalty Rate on annual net sales above million and up to and including million; and on annual net sales above million. Beginning in calendar year 2031, the First Tier Royalty Rate for any calendar year will be determined based on annual net sales of sebetralstat for the prior calendar year: if the prior year s annual net sales are at or above million or if the prior year s annual net sales are below million. Additionally, if sebetralstat achieves annual net sales of at least million in any calendar year ending before January 1, 2031, the Subsidiary will earn a sales-based milestone payment of million. If sebetralstat is approved prior to October 1, 2025, the Subsidiary will have the option to receive a one-time cash payment of million.

 Management Overview 
 We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drug therapies for diseases with significant unmet need. We have used our capabilities to develop sebetralstat, a novel, orally delivered, small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor targeting the disease hereditary angioedema HAE ). 
 HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening, genetically driven disease that features episodes of debilitating and often painful swelling in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. Although multiple therapies have been approved for the disease, we believe people living with HAE are in need of alternatives that better meet their objectives for quality of life and ease of disease control. Other than one oral therapy approved for prophylaxis, currently marketed therapies are all administered by injection, which patients find challenging despite their efficacy because they are painful, time consuming to prepare and administer, and difficult to transfer and store. As a result, many attacks are treated too late to prevent significant symptoms, and a large percentage are not treated at all, leading to needless suffering. We anticipate that there will be strong interest in a safe and effective, orally delivered on-demand treatment, which would provide patients a new and compelling option with which to treat their disease. 
 In February 2024, we announced topline data from the Phase 3 KONFIDENT clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sebetralstat as the first potential oral, on-demand therapy for HAE. KONFIDENT was the largest and most representative trial ever conducted in HAE, enrolling a total of 136 patients from 66 clinical sites across 20 countries. Eligible participants included adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, with or without the use of long-term prophylaxis, and evaluated all attack severities and locations. The clinical trial met all primary and key secondary endpoints and demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo. 
 In June 2024, we filed a New Drug Application NDA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA seeking marketing approval of sebetralstat as the first oral, on-demand therapy for HAE. In August 2024, we were notified that the FDA has accepted the NDA filing for review, with a PDUFA notification date of June 17, 2025. This application is seeking approval for sebetralstat as the first oral, on-demand HAE therapy for adults as well as adolescents ages 12 and above with HAE. We believe the adolescent population has a particularly high unmet need, as patients in this age group frequently experience attacks yet currently only have approved access to intravenously delivered therapies. 
 Also in August 2024, the European Medicines Agency EMA validated the submission of our Marketing Authorization Application MAA for sebetralstat. This application is currently being reviewed by the EMA s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP under the centralized licensing procedure for all 27 Member States of the European Union, as well as the EEA countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. To enable the broadest possible global availability of sebetralstat, if approved, we intend to engage commercial partners in certain international markets. In September 2024, we announced MAA submissions to the regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, and Singapore via the Access Consortium framework for which we have obtained a four-way sharing agreement by the Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency, Swissmedic, the Therapeutic Goods 
 15 

Administration and Health Sciences Authority. The Access Consortium is designed to maximize regulatory collaboration across countries and support a timely review process. We are also preparing a planned Japanese New Drug Application JNDA submission to the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency JPMDA ). 
 In August 2022, we initiated KONFIDENT-S, a two-year open-label extension trial assessing the long-term safety and tolerability of sebetralstat. In addition, this study is examining the potential use of sebetralstat as short-term prophylaxis in the setting of medical and dental procedures, where HAE attacks are known to be triggered. In total, more than 1700 attacks have been treated across KONFIDENT and KONFIDENT-S to date, and KONFIDENT-S includes numerous patients who have taken multiple doses for treatment. 
 In June 2024, we initiated a pediatric clinical trial (KONFIDENT-KID), using an orally disintegrating tablet ODT formulation of sebetralstat developed specifically for pediatric use. If approved, sebetralstat ODT would be the first oral therapy for pediatric patients aged 2 to 11 years old. In addition, sebetralstat would be only the second FDA-approved on-demand therapy of any type in this population. We intend to begin conversion of adolescent and adult participants in the ongoing KONFIDENT-S study to an ODT formulation in Q4 2024, enabling a potential 2026 supplemental NDA sNDA approval by the FDA. If approved, the ODT formulation would provide people living with HAE with an additional novel option for oral on-demand treatment. 
 Sebetralstat has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA, as well as Orphan Drug Designation and an approved Pediatric Investigational Plan from the EMA. In November 2023, sebetralstat was granted Orphan Drug Status in Switzerland. In February 2024, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency MHRA awarded the Innovation Passport for sebetralstat. 
 We believe our preclinical oral Factor XIIa inhibitor program has the potential to be the first orally delivered Factor XIIa inhibitor for indications across a wide variety of therapeutic areas that are supported by scientific evidence. We are undertaking a strategic review of this program, to evaluate the potential for further progress and indications for future development, and we intend to make further decisions on this program following completion of this process. 
 In November 2024, we, as guarantor, and KalVista Pharmaceuticals Limited, our wholly owned subsidiary (the Subsidiary), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement the PSA with DRI Healthcare Acquisitions LP (the Purchaser ), an affiliate of DRI Healthcare Trust, pursuant to which the Subsidiary sold to the Purchaser the right to receive payments from the Subsidiary at a tiered percentage of future worldwide net sales of sebetralstat. 
 Under the terms of the PSA, the Subsidiary received an upfront payment of 100.0 million in exchange for tiered payments on worldwide net sales of sebetralstat, as follows: 5.00 on annual net sales up to and including 500.0 million; 1.10 on annual net sales above 500.0 million and up to and including 750.0 million; and 0.25 on annual net sales above 750.0 million. The Subsidiary is entitled to a potential one-time sales-based milestone payment of 50.0 million if annual global net sales of sebetralstat meet or exceed 550.0 million in any calendar year before January 1, 2031. 
 If sebetralstat is approved prior to October 1, 2025, the Subsidiary will have the option to receive a one-time payment of 22.0 million. If the Subsidiary chooses to receive this optional payment, the royalty rate on net sales up to and including 500 million will increase from 5.00 to 6.00 , and the sales-based milestone amount will increase from 50.0 million to 57.0 million. 
 Also in November 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., TD Securities (USA) LLC, and Stifel, Nicholas Company Incorporated (the Underwriters pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 5,500,000 shares of our common stock, to the Underwriters at an offering price of 10.00 per share (the Offering ). The net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and Offering expenses, were approximately 51.3 million. 
 Further in November 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with the Purchaser pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to the Purchaser an aggregate of 500,000 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of 10.00 per share, in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the private placement, after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses, were approximately 4.7 million. 
 Financial Overview 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with our research activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates. We contract with clinical research organizations to manage our clinical trials under agreed 
 16 

upon budgets for each study, with oversight by our clinical program managers. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Costs for certain research and development activities, such as manufacturing development activities and clinical studies are recognized based on the contracted amounts, as adjusted for the percentage of work completed to date. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the contractual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as prepaid or accrued expenses. We defer and capitalize non-refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. 
 We expect to continue to spend a significant amount of our resources on research and development activities for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct clinical development, manufacturing, and toxicology studies. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, additional drug manufacturing requirements, and later stage toxicology studies such as carcinogenicity studies. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate is affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. Accordingly, we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. 
 Completion dates and costs for clinical development programs as well as our research program can vary significantly for each current and future product candidate and are difficult to predict. As a result, we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the costs associated with development of our product candidates. We anticipate making determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific success of early research programs, results of ongoing and future clinical trials, our ability to enter into collaborative agreements with respect to programs or potential product candidates, as well as ongoing assessments as to the commercial potential of each current or future product candidate. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expenses for personnel in executive, finance, legal, medical affairs, information technology, human resources, investor relations, and commercial functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and fees for accounting, consulting services, and corporate expenses. We expect general and administrative expense to increase as we continue to invest in building the infrastructure to support the commercialization of sebetralstat. 
 Other Income 
 Other income consists of interest income earned on bank interest and marketable securities, research and development tax credits from the United Kingdom government s tax incentive programs set up to encourage research and development in the United Kingdom, realized gains and losses from marketable securities and realized and unrealized exchange rate gains and losses on cash held in foreign currencies and transactions settled in foreign currencies. 
 Income Taxes 
 We historically have incurred net losses and have had no corporation tax liabilities. We file U.S. Federal tax returns, as well as certain state returns. We also file returns in the United Kingdom. Under the U.K. government s research and development tax incentive scheme, we have incurred qualifying research and development expenses and filed claims for research and development tax credits in accordance with the relevant tax legislation. The research and development tax credits are paid out to us in cash and reported as other income. Because of the operating losses and the full valuation allowance provided on all deferred tax assets, including the net operating losses, no tax provision has been recognized in the three months ended October 31, 2024. 
 For tax purposes, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we are required to capitalize and subsequently amortize all R D expenditures over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S. and over fifteen years for research activities conducted outside of the U.S. We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of January 1, 2022.

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 2.5 million to 16.6 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 19.1 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year due to decreases in spending on KVD824 of 0.5 million, sebetralstat of 0.3 million, personnel costs of 0.3 million, and other R D activities of 1.4 million. The impact of exchange rates on research and development expenses resulted in an increase to expenses of 0.6 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, which is reflected in the figures above. 
 Research and development expenses by major programs or categories were as follows (in thousands):

Expenses for the sebetralstat program decreased primarily due to the Phase 3 KONFIDENT trial completing in February 2024. We anticipate that these expenses will remain at or slightly below current levels as both the KONFIDENT-S and KONFIDENT-KID trials are ongoing and continue to enroll participants. 
 Expenses for KVD824 decreased due to the termination of the Phase 2 KOMPLETE clinical trial in October 2022. These expenses have ceased as we do not anticipate any further development of KVD824. 
 Personnel expenses will remain at or slightly below current levels as we prioritize commercial launch efforts. 
 Other costs decreased primarily due to decreased spending on preclinical activities and a transition to recognizing expense associated with sebetralstat pre-commercial awareness within General Administrative . We anticipate Other costs to remain at current levels as we continue development of the oral Factor XIIa inhibitor program and other preclinical activities. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 18.5 million primarily due to increases in personnel costs of 7.0 million, commercial expenses of 6.2 million, sebetralstat awareness of 2.4 million, professional fees of 1.2 million, and other administrative expenses of 1.7 million. We anticipate that expenses will continue at or above current levels as we continue to expand to support the growth of the Company and the planned eventual commercialization of sebetralstat. 
 Other Income. Other income increased 1.5 million primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange rate gains of 1.4 million.

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 4.8 million to 43.2 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 due to an increase in spending on sebetralstat of 3.0 million, an increase in personnel costs of 2.3 million, and an increase in other R D activities of 0.3 million as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. These increases were offset by a decrease in spending on KVD824 of 0.7 million. The impact of exchange rates on research and development expenses resulted in an increase to expenses of 0.8 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, which is reflected in the figures above.

Expenses for the sebetralstat program increased primarily due to activities related to the ongoing KONFIDENT-S and KONFIDENT-KID clinical trials, as well as activities supporting our NDA submission for sebetralstat in June 2024. 
 Expenses for KVD824 decreased primarily due to the termination of the Phase 2 KOMPLETE clinical trial in October 2022. These expenses have ceased as we do not anticipate any further development of KVD824. 
 Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher research and development headcounts compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 26.4 million primarily due to increases in commercial strategy expenses of 10.7 million, personnel costs of 9.5 million, sebetralstat awareness of 2.7 million, professional fees of 1.4 million and administrative expenses of 2.1 million. 
 Other Income. Other income increased 1.4 million primarily due to increases in foreign currency exchange rate gains of 1.4 million and increases in interest income of 1.4 million. These increases were offset by a decrease of 1.4 million in income from research and development tax credits. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred losses since inception and cash outflows from operating activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. We have funded operations primarily through the issuance of capital stock and pre-funded warrants. Our working capital, primarily cash and marketable securities, is anticipated to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months from the date these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 19 

In February 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, Leerink Partners LLC, Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated, and Cantor Fitzgerald Co., as the representatives of several underwriters to sell an aggregate of 7,016,312 shares of our common stock at a price of 15.25 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,483,688 shares of common stock at a price of 15.249 per pre-funded warrant. The net proceeds from the February 2024 Offering, after deducting expenses, were approximately 150.1 million. As of October 31, 2024 no pre-funded warrants from the February 2024 Offering have been exercised. 
 In July 2024, we filed the Registration Statement pursuant to which we may offer and sell securities having an aggregate public offering price of up to 300 million. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we did not offer or sell any shares pursuant to the Registration Statement. 
 In November 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., TD Securities (USA) LLC and Stifel Nicolaus Company, Incorporated, as the representatives of several underwriters to sell an aggregate of 5,500,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of 10.00 per share. The net proceeds from the November 2024 Offering, after deducting estimated expenses, were approximately 51.3 million. 
 Also in November 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with DRI Healthcare Acquisitions LP to sell an aggregate of 500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 10.00 per share in a private placement. We estimate that net proceeds will be approximately 4.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses. 
 Finally, in November 2024 we entered into a royalty purchase agreement with DRI Healthcare Acquisitions LP, an affiliate of DRI Healthcare Trust Royalty Pharma to monetize a portion of our future sebetralstat worldwide net sales. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of 100.0 million in exchange for tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of sebetralstat.

The research and development tax credit receivable increased due to the accrual of tax credits in the three months ended October 31, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities was 46.6 million for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and primarily consisted of a net loss of 53.0 million adjusted for stock-based compensation of 6.5 million, an increase in the research and development tax credit receivable of 4.1 million, realized gains from available for sale securities of 0.9 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.8 million and other changes in net working capital. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was 85.8 million and primarily consisted of the sales and maturities of marketable securities of 87.1 million offset by purchases of marketable securities of 1.0 million, as compared to 48.2 million provided by investing activities during the same period in the prior year primarily due to sales and maturities of marketable securities of 77.9 million offset by purchases of marketable securities of 29.5 million. 
 20 

Net cash provided by financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended October 31, 2024 was 3.3 million and consisted of the issuance of common stock from equity incentive plans, compared to 0.3 million in the same period in the prior year which also consisted of the issuance of common stock from equity incentive plans. 
 Operating Capital Requirements 
 To date, we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products, and we do not have any products that have been approved for commercialization. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize, one of our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new therapeutic products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We currently anticipate that, based upon our operating plans and existing capital resources, we have sufficient funding to operate for at least the next twelve months. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our preclinical and clinical development efforts, future growth to support commercial sales of any approved products, and other activities we may choose to undertake. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings, collaborations, strategic partnerships, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of stock or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these newly issued securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include increased fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends, selling or licensing intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct business. Additional fundraising through collaborations, strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties may require us to relinquish valuable rights to product candidates, including our other technologies, future revenue streams or research programs, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and commercialize other product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and commercialize such product candidates internally. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites for the conduct of clinical trials, preclinical and clinical studies, professional consultants and other vendors for clinical supply manufacturing or other services. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 11, 2024. We are party to several operating leases for office and laboratory space as of October 31, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. See Note 2 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of our significant accounting policies and assumptions used in applying those policies. The accounting policies and estimates that we deem to be critical are discussed in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 11, 2024.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 in the Interim Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition, if known. 
 Item 3 .	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 Item 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
