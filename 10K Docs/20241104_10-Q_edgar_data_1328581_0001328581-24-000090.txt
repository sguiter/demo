 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in "Selling and distribution expenses" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In our BMD segment, our activities relate to the purchase and resale of finished products, and excluding shipping and handling costs from "Materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation)" provides us a clearer view of our operating performance and the effectiveness of our sales and purchasing functions. 
 
 Customer Rebates and Allowances and Cash Discounts 
 
 Rebates are provided to our customers and our customers' customers based on the volume of their purchases, among other factors such as customer loyalty, conversion, and commitment, as well as temporary protection from price increases. We provide the rebates to increase the sell-through of our products. Rebates are generally estimated based on the expected amount to be paid and recorded as a decrease in "Sales." At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of rebates payable to our customers recorded in "Accrued liabilities, Other" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also estimate expected cash discounts on trade accounts receivable based on an analysis of historical experience and record cash discounts as a decrease in "Sales." We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the probability of rebates paid and cash discounts provided changes or when the amounts become fixed. There have not been significant changes to our estimates of rebates, although it is reasonably possible that a change in the estimate may occur. 
 
 Vendor Rebates and Allowances 
 
 We receive rebates and allowances from our vendors under a number of different programs, including vendor marketing programs. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of vendor rebates and allowances recorded in "Receivables, Other" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 are for real estate, including distribution centers, corporate headquarters, land, and other office space. Substantially all of these lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time and are recorded in our BMD segment. Many of our leases include fixed escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into our determination of lease term and lease payments when appropriate. Renewal options generally range from one to with fixed payment terms similar to those in the original lease agreements. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to purchase the leased property at market value. Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. 
 
 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. The current portion of our operating and finance lease liabilities are recorded in "Accrued liabilities, Other" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

million and million, respectively, in money market funds that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. The recorded values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values based on their short-term nature. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the book value of our fixed-rate debt for each period was million, and the fair value was estimated to be million and million, respectively. The difference between the book value and the fair value is derived from the difference between the period-end market interest rate and the stated rate of our fixed-rate, long-term debt. We estimated the fair value of our fixed-rate debt using quoted market prices of our debt in inactive markets (Level 2 inputs). The interest rate on our variable-rate debt is based on market conditions such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or a base rate. Because the interest rate on the variable-rate debt is based on current market conditions, we believe that the estimated fair value of the outstanding balance on our variable-rate debt approximates book value. As discussed below, we also have an interest rate swap to mitigate our variable interest rate exposure, the fair value of which is measured based on Level 2 inputs. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk and Interest Rate Swap 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in variable-rate SOFR on our term loan and when we have loan amounts outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024, we had million of variable-rate debt outstanding based on one-month term SOFR. Our objective is to limit the variability of interest payments on our debt. To meet this objective, we enter into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate the variable-rate cash flow exposure with fixed-rate cash flows. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had interest rate swap agreement. Under the interest rate swap, we receive one-month SOFR plus a spread adjustment of variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments, thereby fixing the interest rate on million of variable rate debt exposure. Payments on this interest rate swap, with a notional principal amount of million, are due on a monthly basis at an annual fixed rate of , and this swap expires in June 2025. The interest rate swap agreement was not designated as a cash flow hedge, and as a result, all changes in the fair value are recognized in "Change in fair value of interest rate swaps" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2024 we recorded a current asset of million in "Prepaid expenses and other" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2023, we recorded a long-term asset of million in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets represent the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement. The swap was valued based on observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities and other observable inputs for interest rates and yield curves (Level 2 inputs). 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk related to customer accounts receivable. In order to manage credit risk, we consider customer concentrations and current economic trends and monitor the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. At September 30, 2024, receivables from two customers accounted for approximately and of total receivables. At December 31, 2023, receivables from these two customers accounted for approximately and of total receivables. No other customer accounted for 10 or more of total receivables.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded million and million, respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of and , respectively. For all periods, the primary reason for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of 21 and the effective tax rate was the effect of state taxes. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash paid for taxes, net of refunds received, were million and million, respectively.

On August 5, 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Boise Cascade Building Materials Distribution L.L.C. (BMD), acquired assets of a door and millwork operation in Boise, Idaho. The purchase price of the acquisition was million, inclusive of a million contingent liability reflecting the acquisition date fair value of earn-out payments. We paid million at the acquisition date and funded the acquisition and related costs with cash on hand. 
 
 Brockway-Smith Company (BROSCO) Acquisition 
 
 On October 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BMD, completed the acquisition of BROSCO, a wholesale distributor specializing in doors and millwork, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 22, 2023 (Merger Agreement), by and among BMD, Firepit Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMD (the Merger Sub), BROSCO and the representative of the BROSCO stockholders. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, on October 2, 2023, Merger Sub merged with and into BROSCO, with BROSCO surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMD (the BROSCO Acquisition). The purchase price of the BROSCO Acquisition was million, net of cash acquired, and inclusive of a post-transaction closing adjustment of million based upon working capital and indebtedness as defined in the Merger Agreement. We funded the BROSCO Acquisition and related costs with cash on hand.

 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) and a million term loan (ABL Term Loan) maturing on the earlier of (a) September 9, 2027 and (b) 90 days prior to the maturity of our million of senior notes due July 1, 2030 (or the maturity date of any permitted refinancing indebtedness or permitted upsized refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof). Interest on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Term Loan are payable monthly. Borrowings under the Amended Agreement are constrained by a borrowing base formula dependent upon levels of eligible receivables and inventory reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit (Availability). 
 
 The Amended Agreement is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, except for property and equipment. The proceeds of borrowings under the agreement are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 
 The Amended Agreement contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including a negative pledge covenant and restrictions on new indebtedness, investments, distributions to equity holders, asset sales, and affiliate transactions, the scope of which are dependent on the Availability existing from time to time. The Amended Agreement also contains a requirement that we meet a :1 fixed-charge coverage ratio (FCCR), applicable only if Availability falls below the greater of (a) of the Line Cap (as defined in the Amended Agreement) and (b) million. Availability exceeded the minimum threshold amounts required for testing of the FCCR at all times since entering into the Amended Agreement, and Availability at September 30, 2024 was million. 
 
 The Amended Agreement permits us to pay dividends only if at the time of payment (a) no default has occurred or is continuing (or would result from such payment) under the Amended Agreement, and (b) either (i) pro forma Excess Availability (as defined in the Amended Agreement) is equal to or exceeds the greater of (x) of the Line Cap and (y) million or (ii) (x) pro forma Excess Availability is equal to or exceeds the greater of (1) of Line Cap and (2) million and (y) our fixed-charge coverage ratio is greater than or equal to :1 on a pro forma basis. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 Interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facility are based, at our election, on either Daily Simple SOFR, Term SOFR, or a base rate, as defined in the Amended Agreement, plus a spread over the index elected that ranges from to for loans based on SOFR and from to for loans based on the base rate. The spread is determined on the basis of a pricing grid that results in a higher spread as average quarterly Availability declines. Both SOFR options include an additional credit spread adjustment of . Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee payable to the issuing bank and a fee payable to the lenders equal to the Term SOFR margin rate. In addition, we are required to pay an unused commitment fee at a rate of per annum of the average unused portion of the lending commitments. 
 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and million and million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding. These letters of credit and borrowings, if any, reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by an equivalent amount. 
 
 ABL Term Loan 
 
 The ABL Term Loan was provided by institutions within the Farm Credit system. Borrowings under the ABL Term Loan may be repaid from time to time at the discretion of the borrowers without premium or penalty. However, any principal amount of ABL Term Loan repaid may not be subsequently re-borrowed. 
 
 Interest rates under the ABL Term Loan are based, at our election, on either Daily Simple SOFR, Term SOFR, or a base rate, as defined in the Amended Agreement, plus a spread over the index elected that ranges from to for SOFR rate loans and from to for base rate loans, both dependent on the amount of Average Excess Availability (as defined in the Amended Agreement). Both SOFR options include an additional credit spread adjustment of . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average interest rate on the ABL Term Loan was approximately .

 2030 Notes 
 
 On July 27, 2020, we issued million of senior notes due July 1, 2030 (2030 Notes) through a private placement that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Interest on our 2030 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1. The 2030 Notes are guaranteed by each of our existing and future direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under our Amended Agreement. 
 
 The 2030 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of Boise Cascade Company and of the guarantors, senior to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness, effectively subordinated to all of their present and future senior secured indebtedness (including all borrowings with respect to our Amended Agreement to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness), and structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of any subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2030 Notes. 
 
 The terms of the indenture governing the 2030 Notes, among other things, limit the ability of Boise Cascade and our restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional debt; declare or pay dividends; redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; make investments; create liens on assets; consolidate, merge or transfer substantially all of their assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and sell or transfer certain assets. The indenture governing the 2030 Notes permits us to pay dividends only if at the time of payment (i) no default has occurred or is continuing (or would result from such payment) under the indenture, and (ii) our consolidated leverage ratio is no greater than :1, or (iii) the dividend, together with other dividends since the issue date, would not exceed our "builder" basket under the indenture. In addition, the indenture includes certain specific baskets for the payment of dividends. 
 
 The indenture governing the 2030 Notes provides for customary events of default and remedies.

 types of stock-based awards under our incentive plan: performance stock units (PSUs) and restricted stock units (RSUs). 
 
 PSU and RSU Awards 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted PSUs to our officers and other employees, subject to performance and service conditions. For the officers, the PSUs granted are subject to a performance period. The number of shares actually awarded will range from to of the target amount. Achievement is measured in annual sub-periods, based on Boise Cascade's return on invested capital (ROIC) for 2024, 2025, and 2026. The average achievement for the included in the performance period will determine the number of earned PSUs, as approved by our compensation committee in accordance with the related grant agreement. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by average invested capital (based on a rolling thirteen-month average). We define NOPAT as net income plus after-tax financing expense. Invested capital is defined as total assets plus capitalized lease expense, less cash, cash equivalents, and current liabilities, excluding short-term debt. For the other employees, the PSUs granted are subject to a performance period. The number of shares actually awarded will range from to of the target amount, depending upon Boise Cascade s 2024 EBITDA, defined as income before interest (interest expense and interest income), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, as approved by executive management, determined in accordance with the related grant agreement. Because the PSUs contain a performance condition, we record compensation expense over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of shares expected to vest.

During the 2023 performance period, officers and other employees both earned of the target based on Boise Cascade's 2023 ROIC and EBITDA, as applicable, determined by our compensation committee and executive management, as applicable, in accordance with the related grant agreements. 
 
 The PSUs granted to officers generally vest in a single installment from the date of grant, while the PSUs granted to other employees vest in equal tranches each year after the grant date. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we granted an aggregate of and RSUs, respectively, to our officers, other employees, and nonemployee directors with only service conditions. The RSUs granted to officers and other employees vest in equal tranches each year after the grant date. The RSUs granted to nonemployee directors vest in a single installment after a period. 
 
 We based the fair value of PSU and RSU awards on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total fair value of PSUs and RSUs vested was million and million, respectively.

 Future dividend declarations, including amount per share, record date and payment date, will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, legal capital requirements and surplus, our future operations and earnings, general financial condition, material cash requirements, restrictions imposed by our asset-based credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes, applicable laws, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 
 
 Stock Repurchase 
 
 On July 28, 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of our common stock. This increase was in addition to the remaining authorized shares under our prior common stock repurchase program that was authorized on February 25, 2015 (the Program). Share repurchases may be made on an opportunistic basis, through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. We are not obligated to purchase any shares and there is no set date that the Program will expire. Our board of directors may increase or decrease the number of shares under the Program or terminate the Program in its discretion at any time. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased shares under the Program at a cost of million, or an average of per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased shares under the Program at a cost of million, or an average of per share. The shares were purchased with cash on hand and are recorded as "Treasury stock" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of common stock that may yet be purchased under the Program. 
 
 In October 2024, we repurchased shares under the Program at a cost of million, or an average of per share. The shares were purchased with cash on hand. In addition, on October 30, 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of our common stock.

 Background 
 
 Boise Cascade Company is a building products company headquartered in Boise, Idaho. As used in this Form 10-Q, the terms "Boise Cascade," "we," and "our" refer to Boise Cascade Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Boise Cascade is a large, integrated wood products manufacturer and building materials distributor. We have two reportable segments: (i) Wood Products, which primarily manufactures engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood; and (ii) Building Materials Distribution (BMD), which is a wholesale distributor of building materials. Our products are used in the construction of new residential housing, including single-family, multi-family, and manufactured homes, the repair-and-remodeling of existing housing, the construction of light industrial and commercial buildings, and industrial applications.

 Executive Overview 
 
 We recorded income from operations of 117.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with income from operations of 185.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. In our Wood Products segment, income decreased 45.7 million to 53.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 99.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to lower EWP and plywood sales prices, as well as higher conversion costs. In addition, lower I-joist sales volumes also contributed to the decrease in segment income. In our BMD segment, income decreased 22.3 million to 74.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 97.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by increased selling and distribution expenses and depreciation and amortization expense of 10.0 million and 5.1 million, respectively. In addition, gross margin decreased 7.7 million, driven by lower margins on commodity products and EWP, offset partially by improved margins on general line products. These changes are discussed further in "Our Operating Results" below. 
 
 We ended third quarter 2024 with 761.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and 395.7 million of undrawn committed bank line availability, for total available liquidity of 1,157.3 million. We had 450.0 million of outstanding debt at September 30, 2024. We used 188.0 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as cash provided by operations was offset by capital spending, dividends paid on our common stock, and treasury stock purchases. A further description of our cash sources and uses for the nine-month comparative periods are discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. 
 
 Demand for the products we manufacture, as well as the products we purchase and distribute, is correlated with new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling activity, and light commercial construction. Residential construction, particularly new single-family construction, is the key demand driver for the products we manufacture and distribute. As reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts were 1.42 million in 2023. Current industry forecasts for U.S. housing starts are approximately 1.35 million in 2024 followed by 2025 starts at or modestly above 1.40 million. For the nine months ended September 2024, single-family starts are outpacing 2023 levels by 10 whereas multi-family starts have declined sharply from historic levels due to increased capital costs for developers, combined with historic levels of multi-family unit completions in 2024. Home affordability remains a challenge for many consumers due to home prices and the cost of financing, with the level of mortgage rates also limiting the supply of existing housing stock available for sale. Large homebuilders are addressing affordability challenges by reducing home sizes and plan complexity, as well as offering mortgage rate buydowns. New residential construction will continue to be an important source of supply for the demand created by undersupplied housing, favorable demographic trends, and low unemployment. We expect 2025 to reflect modest growth in home improvement spending, as the age of U.S. housing stock and elevated levels of homeowner equity will continue to provide a favorable backdrop for repair-and-remodel spending. Ultimately, macroeconomic factors, the level and expectations for mortgage rates, home affordability, home equity levels, home size, and other factors will influence the near-term demand environment for the products we manufacture and distribute. 
 
 As a manufacturer of certain commodity products, we have sales and profitability exposure to declines in commodity product prices and rising input costs. Our distribution business purchases and resells a broad mix of products with periods of increasing prices providing the opportunity for higher sales and increased margins, while declining price environments expose us to declines in sales and profitability. Future product pricing, particularly commodity products pricing and input costs, may be volatile in response to economic uncertainties, industry operating rates, supply-related disruptions, transportation constraints or disruptions, net import and export activity, inventory levels in various distribution channels, and seasonal demand patterns. 

Factors That Affect Our Operating Results and Trends 
 
 Our results of operations and financial performance are influenced by a variety of factors, including the following: 
 
 the commodity nature of a portion of our products and their price movements, which are driven largely by industry capacity and operating rates, industry cycles that affect supply and demand, and net import and export activity; 
 
 general economic conditions, including but not limited to housing starts, repair-and-remodeling activity, light commercial construction, inventory levels of new and existing homes for sale, foreclosure rates, interest rates, inflation, unemployment rates, household formation rates, prospective home buyers' access to and cost of financing, and housing affordability, that ultimately affect demand for our products; 
 
 the highly competitive nature of our industry;

 Sales 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total sales decreased 120.7 million, or 7 , to 1,713.7 million from 1,834.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total sales decreased 37.2 million, or 1 , to 5,156.8 million from 5,194.0 million for the same period in the prior year. As described below, the change in sales was driven by the changes in sales prices and volumes for the products we manufacture and distribute with single-family residential construction activity being the key demand driver of our sales. In third quarter 2024, total U.S. housing starts and single-family housing starts decreased 3 and 1 , respectively, compared with the same period in 2023. On a year-to-date basis through September 2024, total housing starts decreased 3 , while single-family housing starts increased 10 , compared with the same period in 2023. Average composite panel prices for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 19 lower and 4 higher, respectively, than in the same period in the prior year, as reflected by Random Lengths composite panel pricing. Average composite lumber prices for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 13 and 7 lower, respectively, than in the same period in the prior year, as reflected by Random Lengths composite lumber pricing. 
 
 Wood Products. Sales, including sales to our BMD segment, decreased 61.3 million, or 12 , to 453.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 515.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales was driven by lower plywood sales prices of 13 resulting in decreased sales of 19.2 million, and lower sales prices for LVL and I-joists (collectively referred to as EWP) of 5 and 6 , respectively, resulting in decreased sales of 7.2 million and 6.7 million, respectively. Sales volumes for I-joists decreased 8 resulting in decreased sales of 10.7 million, while sales volumes for LVL and plywood were flat. I-joist sales volumes are influenced by multiple factors, including the level of housing starts, competition from other wood-based products, and an increasing proportion of concrete floor applications that limit wood floor opportunity. In addition, other sales, including lumber and residual byproducts, decreased 9.8 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales, including sales to our BMD segment, decreased 70.3 million, or 5 , to 1,412.6 million from 1,482.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in sales was driven by lower sales prices of 6 for both LVL and I-joists, resulting in decreased sales of 27.8 million and 21.8 million, respectively. Plywood sales volumes and sales prices decreased 7 and 4 , respectively, resulting in decreased sales of 33.4 million and 16.1 million, respectively. Plywood sales volumes decreased as we shifted a higher proportion of our internally produced veneer into EWP production, given the change in demand for EWP. In addition, other sales, including lumber and residual byproducts, decreased 38.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes for LVL and I-joists of 12 and 9 , respectively, resulting in increased sales of 46.2 million and 32.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Building Materials Distribution. Sales decreased 102.8 million, or 6 , to 1,567.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,670.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared with the same quarter in the prior year, the overall decrease in sales was driven by a sales price decrease of 6 , as sales volumes were flat. Excluding the impact of the BROSCO acquisition on October 2, 2023, sales would have decreased by 9 . By product line, commodity sales decreased 12 , or 76.2 million; general line product sales increased 4 , or 27.1 million; and EWP sales (substantially all of which are sourced through our Wood Products segment) decreased 14 , or 53.7 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales increased 41.6 million, or 1 , to 4,727.7 million from 4,686.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The overall increase in sales was driven by a sales volume increase of 4 , offset partially by a sales price decrease of 3 . Excluding the impact of the BROSCO acquisition, sales would have decreased by 2 . By product line, commodity sales decreased 6 , or 105.5 million; general line product sales increased 9 , or 165.4 million; and sales of EWP decreased 2 , or 18.3 million. 
 
 Costs and Expenses 
 
 Materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) decreased 66.5 million, or 5 , to 1,375.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1,442.2 million during the same period in the prior year. In our Wood Products segment, materials, labor, and other operating expenses decreased due to lower sales volumes, offset partially by increased labor costs, compared with third quarter 2023. However, materials, labor, and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales (MLO rate) in our Wood Products segment increased by 650 basis points, primarily as the result of lower EWP and plywood sales prices. In BMD, the decrease in materials, labor, and other operating expenses compared with third quarter 2023 was driven by lower purchased materials costs as a result of a decrease in product prices. The BMD segment MLO rate decreased 50 basis points, driven by higher margin percentages on general line products, offset partially by lower margins on commodity and EWP products.

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) increased 24.6 million, or 1 , to 4,123.8 million, compared with 4,099.2 million in the same period in the prior year. In our Wood Products segment, materials, labor, and other operating expenses increased due to higher EWP sales volumes and higher costs of OSB (used in the manufacture of I-joists), compared with the first nine months of 2023. Labor costs were also higher compared with the same period in the prior year. The MLO rate in our Wood Products segment increased by 410 basis points, due primarily to lower EWP and plywood sales prices. In BMD, the increase in materials, labor, and other operating expenses compared with the first nine months of 2023 was driven by higher purchased materials costs due primarily to the BROSCO acquisition. However, the BMD segment MLO rate decreased 20 basis points, driven by higher margin percentages on our general line sales, offset by lower margins on our EWP sales compared with the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5.4 million, or 17 , to 36.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 31.5 million during the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense increased 13.7 million, or 15 , to 107.1 million, compared with 93.4 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in both periods was due to the BROSCO acquisition and other capital expenditures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was also due to 2.2 million of accelerated depreciation recorded in first quarter 2024 for the indefinite curtailment of lumber production at our Chapman, Alabama facility. 
 
 Selling and distribution expenses, inclusive of the BROSCO acquisition, increased 9.8 million, or 7 , to 157.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 147.7 million during the same period in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expense of 8.1 million, offset partially by decreased incentive compensation expense of 2.1 million. In addition, costs related to professional fees and shipping and handling increased 1.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling and distribution expenses increased 35.7 million, or 9 , to 451.4 million, compared with 415.7 million during the same period in 2023. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses of 20.9 million, offset partially by decreased incentive compensation expense of 2.7 million. Shipping and handling and occupancy costs increased 2.7 million and 2.6 million, respectively. In addition, costs related to professional fees, travel and entertainment, and advertising increased 4.8 million. 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 1.4 million, or 5 , to 26.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 27.6 million for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.0 million, or 8 , to 77.2 million, compared with 84.2 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease in both periods was primarily the result of lower incentive compensation and professional fees, offset partially by an increase in other employee-related expenses. 
 
 Income From Operations 
 
 Income from operations decreased 68.3 million to 117.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 185.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income from operations decreased 105.9 million to 397.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 503.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Wood Products. Segment income decreased 45.7 million to 53.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 99.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in segment income was due primarily to lower EWP and plywood sales prices, as well as higher conversion costs . In addition, lower I-joist sales volumes also contributed to the decrease in segment income. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, segment income decreased 75.1 million to 197.9 million from 273.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in segment income was due primarily to lower EWP and plywood sales prices, as well as higher wood fiber and conversion costs. These decreases in segment income were offset partially by higher EWP sales volumes. 
 
 Building Materials Distribution. Segment income decreased 22.3 million to 74.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 97.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in segment income was driven by increased selling and distribution expenses and depreciation and amortization expense of 10.0 million and 5.1 million, respectively. In addition, gross margin decreased 7.7 million, driven by lower margins on commodity products and EWP, offset partially by improved margins on general line products.

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, segment income decreased 32.6 million to 232.7 million from 265.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in segment income was driven by increased selling and distribution expenses and depreciation and amortization expense of 37.4 million and 13.5 million, respectively. These decreases in segment income were offset partially by a gross margin increase of 15.4 million, resulting primarily from improved gross margins on general line products, offset partially by lower gross margins on EWP and commodity products. In addition, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.1 million. 
 
 Corporate. Unallocated corporate expenses increased 0.3 million to 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 11.0 million for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, unallocated corporate expenses decreased 1.9 million to 33.2 million from 35.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to lower incentive compensation. 
 
 Other 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income decreased 3.6 million to 10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 13.8 million for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income decreased 3.7 million to 31.3 million from 35.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in both periods was due primarily to lower average balances of cash equivalents. 
 
 Change in fair value of interest rate swaps. For information related to our interest rate swap, see the discussion under "Interest Rate Risk and Interest Rate Swap" of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 29.8 million and 101.1 million, respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of 24.7 and 24.8 , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 49.0 million and 131.7 million, respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of 25.5 and 25.4 , respectively. For all periods, the primary reason for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of 21 and the effective tax rate was the effect of state taxes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We ended third quarter 2024 with 761.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and 450.0 million of debt. At September 30, 2024, we had 1,157.3 million of available liquidity (cash and cash equivalents and undrawn committed bank line availability). Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 188.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as cash provided by operations was offset by capital spending, dividends paid on our common stock, and treasury stock purchases. Further descriptions of our cash sources and uses for the nine-month comparative periods are noted below. 
 
 We believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations, working capital, income tax payments, and to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock over the next 12 months. We expect to fund our seasonal and intra-month working capital requirements in the remainder of 2024 from cash on hand and, if necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Table of Contents 

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 We generate cash primarily from sales of our products, as well as short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary uses of cash are for expenses related to the manufacture and distribution of building products, including inventory purchased for resale, wood fiber, labor, energy, and glues and resins. In addition to paying for ongoing operating costs, we use cash to invest in our business, service our debt and lease obligations, and return cash to our shareholders through dividends or common stock repurchases. Below is a discussion of our sources and uses of cash for operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 (thousands) Net cash provided by operations 343,752 521,129 Net cash used for investment (140,144) (96,801) Net cash used for financing (391,583) (149,709) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities generated 343.8 million of cash, compared with 521.1 million of cash generated in the same period in 2023. The 177.4 million decrease in cash provided by operations was due primarily to an increase in working capital, as well as a decrease in income from operations, offset partially by a 13.7 million decrease in cash paid for taxes, net of refunds, compared to the same period in 2023. Working capital increased 94.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a 1.1 million decrease for the same period in the prior year. See "Our Operating Results" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information related to factors affecting our operating results. 
 
 The increase in working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher inventories and receivables, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and decreased inventories, offset partially by higher receivables. The increase in receivables in both periods primarily reflect increased sales of approximately 9 and 30 , comparing sales for the months of September 2024 and 2023 with sales for the months of December 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 inventories increased in preparation and response to the building season. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 inventories decreased in our Wood Products segment due to improved demand compared to fourth quarter 2022. However, our BMD segment inventories increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to seasonal building, steady housing demand, and location expansions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to the increase in inventories, offset partially by employee incentive compensation payouts made during the period. The increase in accounts payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to increased purchasing in response to improved demand compared to fourth quarter 2022 and extended terms offered by certain BMD vendors. 
 
 Investment Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used 135.8 million and 99.3 million, respectively, of cash for purchases of property and equipment, including business improvement and quality/efficiency projects, replacement and expansion projects, and ongoing environmental compliance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also used 5.6 million of cash for acquisitions of businesses and facilities, which consisted of 3.4 million for post-transaction closing adjustments related to the BROSCO acquisition, as well as 2.2 million for acquired assets of a door and millwork operation in Boise, Idaho. For further discussion on these acquisitions, see Note 5, Acquisitions, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 1.0 million of earn-out income related to a previous asset sale in our Wood Products segment. 
 
 Excluding potential acquisitions, we expect capital expenditures in 2024 to total approximately 220 million to 240 million. We expect our capital spending, excluding acquisitions, to be approximately 200 million to 220 million in 2025. Capital spending in 2024 and 2025 will be for business improvement and quality/efficiency projects, replacement and expansion projects, and ongoing environmental compliance. In addition, our 2024 capital expenditures range includes spending on previously announced projects to convert a plywood layup line to a parallel laminated veneer line at our Chapman, Alabama plywood facility, as well as add I-joist production capabilities at our Thorsby, Alabama EWP mill which will be completed in 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 2025. At our Oakdale, Louisiana facility, multiple investment projects are underway and planned for 2025 which include upgrade and redesign of the log utilization center, a new veneer dryer and press, and modification of an existing veneer dryer. Our 2024 and 2025 capital expenditures range also includes spending on the previously announced greenfield distribution centers in Texas and South Carolina in our BMD segment. These levels of capital expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of several factors, including acquisitions, efforts to further accelerate organic growth, exercise of lease purchase options, our financial results, future economic conditions, availability of engineering and construction resources, and timing and availability of equipment purchases. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities used 391.6 million of cash, including 220.5 million in common stock dividend payments, 158.5 million for the repurchase of 1,232,345 shares of our common stock, and 11.1 million of tax withholding payments on stock-based awards. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not borrow under our revolving credit facility and therefore have no borrowings outstanding on the facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our financing activities used 149.7 million of cash, including 140.9 million in common stock dividend payments, 5.9 million of tax withholding payments on stock-based awards, and 1.5 million for the repurchase of 25,678 shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not borrow under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Future dividend declarations, including amount per share, record date and payment date, will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, legal capital requirements and surplus, our future operations and earnings, general financial condition, material cash requirements, restrictions imposed by our asset-based credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes, applicable laws, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 
 
 For more information related to our debt transactions and structure, our dividend policy, and our stock repurchase program, see the discussion in Note 7, Debt, and Note 10, Stockholders' Equity, respectively, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Other Material Cash Requirements 
 
 For information about other material cash requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in other material cash requirements outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2023. 

Guarantees 
 
 Note 8, Debt, and Note 16, Commitments, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, and Guarantees, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our 2023 Form 10-K describe the nature of our guarantees, including the approximate terms of the guarantees, how the guarantees arose, the events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees, and the maximum potential undiscounted amounts of future payments we could be required to make. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the guarantees disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Seasonal Influences 
 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These seasonal factors are common in the building products industry. Seasonal changes in levels of building activity affect our building products businesses, which are dependent on housing starts, repair-and-remodeling activities, and light commercial construction activities. We typically report lower sales volumes in the first and fourth quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market, and we generally have higher sales volumes in the second and third quarters, reflecting an increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions. We typically have higher working capital in the first and second quarters in preparation and response to the building season. Seasonally cold weather increases costs, especially energy consumption costs, at most of our manufacturing facilities.

 Employees 
 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had approximately 7,480 employees. Approximately 18 of these employees work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. As of October 27, 2024, we had ten collective bargaining agreements. One agreement covering approximately 50 employees at our Woodinville BMD facility expired on May 31, 2024, but the terms and conditions of this agreement remain in effect pending negotiation of a new agreement. One agreement covering approximately 40 employees at our Vancouver BMD facility is set to expire on December 31, 2024, one agreement covering approximately 20 employees at our Billings BMD facility is set to expire on March 31, 2025, and two agreements covering approximately 750 employees at our Oakdale and Florien plywood plants are set to expire on July 15, 2025. The terms and conditions of these agreements will remain in effect after expiration pending negotiation of new agreements. We may not be able to renew these agreements or may renew them on terms that are less favorable to us than the current agreements. If any of these agreements are not renewed or extended upon their termination, we could experience a material labor disruption, strike, or significantly increased labor costs at one or more of our facilities, either in the course of negotiations of a labor agreement or otherwise. Labor disruptions or shortages could prevent us from meeting customer demands or result in increased costs, thereby reducing our sales and profitability. 

Disclosures of Financial Market Risks 
 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial risks such as changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to financial market risks disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Environmental 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to environmental issues disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional information, see Environmental in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain. We review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. For information about critical accounting estimates, see Critical Accounting Estimates in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K. At September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

New and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. We have designed these controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. We have also designed our disclosure controls to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our chief executive officer (CEO) and our chief financial officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow them to make timely decisions regarding our required disclosures. Based on their evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
