 On June 8, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Mutual Capital Holdings, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (MCH), and Mutual Capital Merger Sub, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MCH ("Merger Sub"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MCH (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the "Company Common Stock") (other than shares owned by the Company as treasury stock), will be converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest, representing a total equity value of approximately million. The closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of the Company Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of authorizations required to be obtained from applicable insurance regulators, and (iii) other customary conditions. For each of the Company and MCH, the obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of, and compliance with covenants by, the other party, in accordance with the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement.

ANALYSIS 
 
 The following tables display the total value of securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The tables segregate the securities based on type, noting the fair value, amortized cost, and unrealized loss on each category of investment as well as in total. The tables further classifies the securities based on the length of time they have been in an unrealized loss position.

The fixed income portfolio contained securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 . Of these securities, have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 consecutive months or longer and represent in unrealized losses. All fixed income securities in the investment portfolio continue to pay the expected coupon payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Credit-related impairments on fixed income securities that we do not plan to sell, and for which we are not more likely than not to be required to sell, are recognized in net earnings. Any non-credit related impairment is recognized in comprehensive earnings. Current unrealized losses are the result of rising interest rates. Based on management s analysis, the fixed income portfolio is of a high credit quality, and it is believed it will recover the amortized cost basis of the fixed income securities. Management monitors the credit quality of the fixed income investments to assess if it is probable that the Company will receive its contractual or estimated cash flows in the form of principal and interest. 
 
 There were CECL allowances from the fixed income portfolio recognized in net earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . In addition, the Company is not required to, nor does it intend to sell these investments prior to recovering the entire amortized cost basis for each security, which may be at maturity.

 Other Invested Assets

Our balance available for future endeavors with the private investment fund is as of September 30, 2024 . In June 2024, we agreed to commit up to million to another private investment fund, subject to regulatory approval, which may also be callable from time to time by such fund.

Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS), Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMO), Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities (CMBS) and Asset-backed Securities (ABS) The pricing vendor evaluation methodology includes principally interest rate movements and new issue data. Evaluation of the tranches (non-volatile, volatile, or credit sensitivity) is based on the pricing vendors interpretation of accepted modeling and pricing conventions. This information is then used to determine the cash flows for each tranche, benchmark yields, pre-payment assumptions, and to incorporate collateral performance. To evaluate CMO volatility, an option adjusted spread model is used in combination with models that simulate interest rate paths to determine market price information. This process allows the pricing vendor to obtain evaluations of a broad universe of securities in a way that reflects changes in yield curve, index rates, implied volatility, mortgage rates, and recent trade activity. MBS, CMBS, CMO, and ABS with corroborated and observable inputs are classified as Level 2. All MBS, CMBS, CMO, and ABS holdings are deemed Level 2. 
 
 U.S. Treasury Bonds, Common Stocks and Exchange Traded Funds U.S. treasury bonds and exchange traded equities have readily observable price levels and are classified as Level 1 (fair value based on quoted market prices). All common stock holdings are deemed Level 1. 
 
 Preferred Stock Preferred stocks do not have readily observable prices but do have quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices and are classified as Level 2. All preferred stock holdings are deemed Level 2. 
 
 Due to the relatively short-term nature of cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, their carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of fair value. Other invested assets include notes receivable, stock, a limited partnership, a SAFE investment, Funds at Lloyd's, and membership in the FHLBC. Notes receivable are carried at outstanding balance plus accrued interest. Stock is at fair value when available. The limited partnership and Funds at Lloyd's, the SAFE investment, and the membership in FHLBC are carried at cost.

 The Company may make discretionary contributions to the ESOP and pay dividends on unallocated shares to the ESOP. ICC makes annual contributions to the ESOP sufficient to repay the loan. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated to participants based on relative compensation. The Company repurchases shares from participants that have left our employment. ICC Holdings did not contribute to the ESOP for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . No other contributions were made to the ESOP during these time periods. 
 
 A compensation expense charge is booked monthly during each year for the shares committed to be allocated to participants that year, determined with reference to the fair market value of our stock at the time the commitment to allocate the shares is accrued and recognized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized compensation expense of rela ted to shares of our c ommon stock that are committed to be released to participants accounts at September 30, 2024.

 Overview 
 
 Illinois Casualty Company ("ICC") is a regional property and casualty insurance company incorporated in Illinois and focused exclusively on the food and beverage industry. ICC is a wholly owned subsidiary of ICC Holdings, Inc (the "Company"). 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had direct written premiums of 76,788,000, net premiums earned of 62,332,000, and net earnings of 3,560,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had direct premiums written of 68,900,000, net premiums earned of 55,529,000, and net earnings of 1,396,000. On September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of 232,927,000 and equity of 73,103,000. On December 31, 2023, the Company had total assets of 211,017,000 and equity of 67,004,000. 
 
 On June 8, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Mutual Capital Holdings, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (MCH), and Mutual Capital Merger Sub, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MCH ("Merger Sub"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MCH (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock") (other than shares owned by the Company as treasury stock), will be converted into the right to receive 23.50 in cash, without interest, representing a total equity value of approximately 73.8 million. The closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of the Company Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of authorizations required to be obtained from applicable insurance regulators, and (iii) other customary conditions. For each of the Company and MCH, the obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of, and compliance with covenants by, the other party, in accordance with the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement. For a description of the treatment of equity awards under the Merger Agreement, see the Company's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on October 28, 2024. 
 
 Principal Revenue and Expense Items 
 
 We derive our revenue primarily from premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) from investments. 
 
 Gross and net premiums written 
 
 Gross premiums written are equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance. Net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers (ceded premiums written). 

- 23 -

Table of Contents 

Net premiums earned 
 
 Premiums earned are the earned portion of our net premiums written. Gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period. Insurance premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion of the premiums that are not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written on July 1, 2024, one-half of the premiums would be earned in 2024 and the other half would be earned in 2025. 
 
 Net investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments 
 
 We invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities (including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses) in cash, cash equivalents, equities, fixed securities, and real estate. Investment income includes interest and dividends earned on invested assets as well as rental income on investment properties. Net realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income. We recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost (in the case of fixed securities) and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an as a result of impairment when sold or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. We recognize in earnings the change in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and limited partnership investments, excluding fixed income securities, when our investments are trading at an amount greater than or less than their cost, respectively. Net unrealized gains on investments in net earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 534,000 and 1,595,000, respectively. Net unrealized (losses) gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 for investments in net earnings were losses of 837,000 and gains of 269,000, respectively. Our portfolio of investment securities is managed by two independent third parties with managers specializing in the insurance industry. The board of directors investment committee is responsible for establishing investment policies and monitoring risk limits and tolerances. We seek to protect customers benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments, and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. We are exposed to two primary sources of investment risk: 

credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; and 

interest rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves. 

Our ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. We devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. We manage credit risk through industry, issuer, and asset class diversification. 
 
 ICC s expenses consist primarily of: 
 
 Losses and settlement expenses 
 
 Losses and settlement expenses represent the largest expense item and include: (1) claim payments made, (2) estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods, and (3) costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. 
 
 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
 
 Expenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses. Variable policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses, premium taxes, and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business. These policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Fixed policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include salaries, rent, office supplies, and depreciation. Other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs, accounting, and employee compensation, as well as audit and legal expenses. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date. 
 
 Key Financial Measures 
 
 We evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we utilize certain operational financial measures that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These operational measures are combined ratio, written premiums, underwriting income, the losses and settlement expense ratio, the expense ratio, the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus, and return on average equity. 
 
 We measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written. We measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and settlement expense, underwriting expense, and combined ratios. We also measure profitability by examining underwriting income (loss) and net earnings (loss).

Table of Contents 

Losses and settlement expense ratio 
 
 The losses and settlement expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of losses and settlement expenses incurred to net premiums earned. We measure the losses and settlement expense ratio on an accident year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability. An accident year loss ratio measures losses and settlement expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year, regardless of when they are reported, as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. A calendar year loss ratio measures losses and settlement expenses for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior accident years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. 
 
 Expense ratio 
 
 The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to premiums earned, and measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting, and administering our insurance business. 
 
 GAAP combined ratio 
 
 Our GAAP combined ratio is the sum of the losses and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio and measures our overall underwriting profit. If the GAAP combined ratio is below 100 , we are making an underwriting profit. If our combined ratio is at or above 100 , we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient. 
 
 Net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio 
 
 The net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written, after reinsurance ceded, to statutory surplus. This ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business. The higher the ratio, the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate. 
 
 Underwriting income (loss) 
 
 Underwriting income (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of our insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting losses and settlement expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from net earned premiums. Each of these items is presented as a caption in our statements of earnings. 
 
 Net earnings (loss) and return on average equity 
 
 We use net earnings (loss) to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net earnings. In determining return on average equity for a given year, net earnings (loss) is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The accounting policies and estimates considered by management to be critically important in the preparation and understanding of the Company s financial statements and related disclosures are presented in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Our results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general. The operating results of the United States property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition, weather, catastrophic events, regulation, general economic conditions, judicial trends, fluctuations in interest rates, and other changes in the investment environment. 
 
 Our premium and underwriting results have been, and continue to be, influenced by market conditions. Pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been cyclical. During a soft market cycle, price competition is more significant than during a hard market cycle and makes it difficult to attract and retain properly priced commercial business. A hard market typically has a positive effect on premium growth.

Table of Contents 

The following summarizes our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Premiums 
 
 Direct premiums written increased by 7,888,000, or 11.4 , to 76,788,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 68,900,000 for the same period of 2023. Net written premium increased by 5,178,000, or 8.5 , to 66,348,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 61,170,000 for the same period in 2023. Net premiums earned increased by 6,803,000, or 12.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consistent with our increased premium writings in 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we ceded to reinsurers 10,515,000 of earned premiums, compared to 8,066,000 of earned premiums for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Ceded earned premiums as a percent of direct p remiums written increased to 13.7 from 11.7 for the nine mo nths ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increased direct earned premiums and the addition of a ceding allowance on the first excess reinsurance contracts. 
 
 Premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. 
 
 Investment Income 
 
 Net investment income increased by 739,000, or 19.5 , to 4,537,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,798,000 for the same period in 2023. This increase is the result of reinvestment of fixed income securities at higher effective interest rates than securities matured or disposed of. 
 
 Other 
 
 Other is derived from policies we write and represents additional charges to policyholders for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billing or policy issuance costs. Other decreased by 115,000, or 71.4 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to decreased Katkin sales.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we experienced unfavorable development of 8,168,000 and 3,366,000, respectively. The current year development is primarily due to additional information received on prior year accident claims for Liquor Liability.

Losses and Settlement Expenses 
 
 Losses and settlement expenses increased by 4,335,000, or 11.8 , to 41,034,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 36,699,000 for the same period in 2023. The loss and settlement expense ratio decreased by 0.3 to 65.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 66.1 for the same period in 2023. The increase in losses and settlement expenses was driven by increased Liquor Liability claims. The ratio decreased as Businessowner's Property claims decreased relative to net earned premium. In addition, claim frequency by product in 2024 has decreased 0.4 to 5.4 despite policies in-force growing. 
 
 Policy Acquisition Costs and Other Operating Expenses and the Expense Ratio 
 
 Policy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports, and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets the direct commissions it pays with ceded commissions it receives from reinsurers. Other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs, accounting, and internal control salaries, as well as audit and legal expenses. Policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by 2,223,000, or 10.7 , to 23,047,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 20,824,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase in these expenses is mainly due to increases in legal, consulting, and commissions. Legal and consulting expenses are up 1,000,000 due to the pending merger and past proxy contest. Commissions increased as a result of higher written premiums. 
 
 Our expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by net earned premiums. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a product line remain in general corporate expenses. 
 
 Our expense ratio decreased by 50 basis poi nts from 37.5 to 37.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 General Corporate Expenses 
 
 General corporate expenses consist primarily of occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. These costs are largely fixed and, therefore, do not vary significantly with premium volume but do vary with the Company s changes in properties held for investment. In addition, CECL expense is recorded here. Our general corporate expenses increased by 255,000, or 41.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase is due to increased current expected credit losses related to two new Other Invested Assets in 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense remained the same at 138,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 We reported income tax expense of 985,000 and 363,000 for the nine mont hs ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense in 2024 was primarily due to unrealized gains on investments and the associated deferred tax expense recognized. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.7 , compared to 20.6 for the same period in 2023. Effective rates are dependent upon components of pretax earnings and losses and the related tax effects. 
 
 The Company has not established a valuation allowance against any of the net deferred tax assets.

The following summarizes our results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Premiums 
 
 Direct premiums written increased by 3,167,000, or 12.9 , to 27,662,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 24,495,000 for the same period of 2023. Net written premium increased by 2,533,000, or 11.7 , to 24,218,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 21,685,000 for the same period in 2023. Net premiums earned increased by 2,477,000, or 12.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, consistent with our increased premium writings in 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we ceded to reinsurers 3,479,000 of earned premiums, compared to 2,878,000 of earned premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Ceded earned premiums as a percent of direct p remiums written increased to 12.6 from 11.8 for the three mo nths ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increased direct earned premiums and the addition of a ceding allowance on the first excess reinsurance contracts. 
 
 Premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. 
 
 Investment Income 
 
 Net investment income increased by 215,000, or 16.0 , to 1,557,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,342,000 for the same period in 2023. This increase is the result of reinvestment of fixed income securities at higher effective interest rates than securities matured or disposed. 
 
 Other 
 
 Other is derived from policies we write and represents additional charges to policyholders for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billing or policy issuance costs. Other increased by 5,000, or 9.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

Losses and Settlement Expenses 
 
 Losses and settlement expenses increased by 708,000, or 5.3 , to 14,144,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 13,436,000 for the same period in 2023. The loss and settlement expense ratio decreased by 4.8 to 65.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 69.9 for the same period in 2023. The increase in losses and settlement expenses was driven by increased Businessowner's Liability claims. The ratio decreased as Businessowner's Property claims decreased relative to net earned premium. In addition, claim frequency by product in 2024 has decreased 0.4 to 5.4 despite policies in-force growing. 
 
 Policy Acquisition Costs and Other Operating Expenses and the Expense Ratio 
 
 Policy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports, and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets the direct commissions it pays with ceded commissions it receives from reinsurers. Other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs, accounting, and internal control salaries, as well as audit and legal expenses. Policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by 273,000, or 3.9 , to 7,302,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7,029,000 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Our expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by net earned premiums. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a product line remain in general corporate expenses. 
 
 Our expense ratio decreased by 290 basis poi nts from 36.5 to 33.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The main driver of this decrease is contingent commissions to net earned premiums, which are down 2.35 , or 235 basis points. 
 
 General Corporate Expenses 
 
 General corporate expenses consist primarily of occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. These costs are largely fixed and, therefore, do not vary significantly with premium volume but do vary with the Company s changes in properties held for investment. In addition, CECL expense is recorded here. Our general corporate expenses increased by 44,000, or 20.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense remained unchanged at 46,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 46,000 for the same period during 2023 . 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 We reported income tax expense of 567,000 and a benefit of 199,000 for the three mont hs ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense in 2024 was primarily due to unrealized gains on investments and the associated deferred tax expense recognized. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.6 , compared to 20.5 for the same period in 2023. Effective rates are dependent upon components of pretax earnings and losses and the related tax effects. 
 
 The Company has not established a valuation allowance against any of the net deferred tax assets.

Our actuary determined a range of reasonable reserve estimates which reflect the uncertainty inherent in the loss reserve process. This range does not represent the range of all possible outcomes. We believe that the actuarially determined ranges represent reasonably likely changes in the loss and settlement expense estimates, however actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The range was determined by line of business and accident year after a review of the output generated by the various actuarial methods utilized. The actuary reviewed the variance around the select loss reserve estimates for each of the actuarial methods and selected reasonable low and high estimates based on his knowledge and judgment. In making these judgments the actuary typically assumed, based on his experience, that the larger the reserve the less volatility and that property reserves would exhibit less volatility than casualty reserves. In addition, when selecting these low and high estimates, the actuary considered: 

historical industry development experience in our business line; 

historical company development experience; 

the impact of court decisions on insurance coverage issues, which can impact the ultimate cost of settling claims; 

changes in our internal claims processing policies and procedures; and 

trends and risks in claim costs, such as risk that medical cost inflation could increase. 

Our actuary is required to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all of these and other factors in the analysis of our loss and settlement expense reserves, and related range of anticipated losses. Because of the level of uncertainty impacting the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that different actuaries would arrive at different conclusions. The method of determining the reserve range has not changed and the reserve range generated by our actuary is consistent with the observed development of our loss reserves over the last few years. 
 
 The width of the range in reserves arises primarily because specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and the ultimate losses paid and loss adjustment expenses incurred with respect to known losses may be larger than currently estimated. The ultimate frequency or severity of these claims can be very different than the assumptions we used in our estimation of ultimate reserves for these exposures. 
 
 Specifically, the following factors could impact the frequency and severity of claims, and therefore, the ultimate amount of loss and settlement expense paid: 

the rate of increase in labor costs, medical costs, and material costs that underlie insured risks; 

development of risk associated with our expanding producer relationships and our growth in new states or states where we currently have small market share; and 

impact of changes in laws or regulations. 

The estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid loss and settlement expense inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable development). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we experienced unfavorable development of 8,168,000 and 3,366,000, respectively. 
 
 The potential for variability in our reserves is evidenced by this development. As a further illustration of reserve variability, we previously estimated unpaid loss and settlement expense net of reinsurance at the end of 2023 at 59,101,000. As of September 30, 2024, that reserve was re-estimated at 67,269,000, which is 8,168,000 higher than the previous estimate. This increase was largely driven by several motor vehicle related claims in accident years 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 
 The estimation of our reserves is based on several actuarial methods, each of which incorporates many quantitative assumptions. The judgment of the actuary plays an important role in selecting among various loss development factors and selecting the appropriate method, or combination of methods, to use for a given accident year. 
 
 Investments 
 
 Our investments are primarily composed of fixed maturity debt securities and both common and preferred stock equity securities. We categorize all our debt securities as available-for-sale (AFS), which are carried at fair value as determined by management based upon quoted market prices when available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using a secondary pricing source or using quoted market prices of similar securities. Changes in unrealized investment gains or losses on our AFS securities, net of applicable income taxes, are reflected directly in equity as a component of comprehensive earnings (loss) and, accordingly, have no effect on net earnings (loss). Equity securities and the limited partnership are carried at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in net earnings (loss). Other invested assets include notes receivable, stock, a SAFE investment, Funds at Lloyd's, and membership in the FHLBC. Notes receivable are carried at outstanding balance plus accrued interest, which management believes reflects fair value. The Funds at Lloyd's, the SAFE investment, and the membership in FHLBC are carried at cost. Investment income is recognized when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold, or credit loss has occurred.

Table of Contents 

Effective with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, on January 1, 2023, we consider several factors, including, but not limited to, the following when evaluating whether a decline in value for AFS debt securities relates to credit losses: 

the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost; 

adverse conditions related to the security, an industry, geographic area such as changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, changes in technology, or discontinuation of a segment of the business that may affect future earnings potential; 

the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make future payments; 

failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and 

any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. 

In addition, we no longer consider the duration of the decline in value in assessing whether our fixed income securities available for sale have a credit loss impairment. If a credit loss is determined to exist, the credit loss impairment is recognized as a credit loss expense in the statement of operations with an offset to an allowance for credit losses. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense. Credit losses are limited to the amount by which the amortized cost of the security exceeds fair value. The Company and its independent investment managers evaluated our available-for-sale securities and determined that as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, there were no securities for which an allowance for credit losses adjustment was needed.

Corporate Bonds 
 
 The gross unrealized losses in the corporate bond portfolio decreased by about 0.7 million from a loss of 3,070,186 at the end of 2023 to a loss of 2,336,523 as of September 30, 2024. This was driven by the movement in Treasury rates. The Treasury yield curve has shifted significantly lower over Q3 which has caused bond prices across fixed income sectors to rise. Additionally, the corporate bond portfolio has benefitted from further spread tightening in Q3 (corporate spreads are now tighter by about 20 bps from the beginning of 2024). 
 
 Municipal Bonds 
 
 The gross unrealized losses in the municipal portfolio decreased by about 0.4 million from a loss of 3,293,146 at the end of 2023 to a loss of 2,871,004 as of September 30, 2024. This was driven by the movement in Treasury rates. The Treasury yield curve has shifted significantly lower over Q3 which has caused bond prices across fixed income sectors to rise. The municipal bond portfolio has benefitted by spread tightening so far in 2024 (taxable municipal spreads were mostly unchanged for Q3 but are tighter by about 13 bps from the beginning of 2024) 
 
 We screen the portfolio for securities that hit certain thresholds and review those securities for potential impairment. The thresholds vary by sector. For corporates, as an example, we screen for any holding that has a market price below 75 and a spread greater than the average spread of the BB Corporate index. For preferred stocks, we screen for securities that have an unrealized loss of more than 30 of book value. For structured securities, we use more quantitative analysis, including a discounted cash-flow model to measure the amount by which the present value of expected future cash flows is below the asset's amortized cost. When assessing whether the fair value of the security will be recovered, we may compare the present value of the cash flows likely to be collected, based on an evaluation of all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, to the amortized cost basis of the security. The shortfall of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is referred to as the "credit loss." If there is a credit loss, the impairment is other-than-temporary. Under the new guidance for AFS debt securities, if we identify that there is a credit risk, an allowance for credit losses (ACL) will be recorded in earnings. Any remaining portion of unrealized losses related to the noncredit-related component will continue to be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. If we determine that we intend to sell the security, or that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses, the prior allowance would be removed, and the amortized cost basis would be adjusted to fair value.

Table of Contents 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not take a credit loss or impairment charge on any of its fixed income security holdings. Adverse investment market conditions, or poor operating results of underlying investments, could result in credit losses or impairment charges in the future. 
 
 We use quoted values and other data provided by independent pricing services in our process for determining fair values of our investments. The evaluations of such pricing services represent an exit price and a good faith opinion as to what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security in a current sale. This pricing service provides us with one quote per instrument. For fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets, market quotations are provided. For fixed maturity securities that do not trade daily, the independent pricing service prepares estimates of fair value using a wide array of observable inputs including relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. The observable market inputs that our independent pricing service utilizes may include (listed in order of priority for use) benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, market bids/offers, and other reference data on markets, industry, and the economy. Additionally, the independent pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. The pricing service did not use broker quotes in determining the fair values of our investments. 
 
 Should the independent pricing service be unable to provide a fair value estimate, we would attempt to obtain a non-binding fair value estimate from a number of broker-dealers and review this estimate in conjunction with a fair value estimate reported by an independent business news service or other sources. In instances where only one broker-dealer provides a fair value for a fixed maturity security, we use that estimate. In instances where we can obtain fair value estimates from more than one broker-dealer, we would review the range of estimates and would select the most appropriate value based on the facts and circumstances. Should neither the independent pricing service nor a broker-dealer provide a fair value estimate, we would develop a fair value estimate based on cash flow analyses, and other valuation techniques that utilize certain unobservable inputs. Accordingly, we would classify such a security as a Level 3 investment. 
 
 The fair value estimates of our investments provided by the independent pricing service at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were utilized, among other resources, in reaching a conclusion as to the fair value of our investments. 
 
 Our investment manager reviews the reasonableness of the pricing provided by the vendors they use and have pricing policy and procedures that are SSAE audited. Each month-end, they review 1) securities priced beyond a specific tolerance from the prior month-end, 2) securities priced beyond a specific tolerance from the prior two month-ends, 3) securities with valuations resulting in negative yields, and 4) securities deemed as outliers. Our investment manager reviews the aforementioned securities either to affirm that the valuations are appropriate or determine that a change to a different approved vendor is more appropriate based on current market information. The classification within the fair value hierarchy of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, is then confirmed based on the final conclusions from the pricing review. On a quarterly basis, our investment manager provides a Price Validation report that measures the variance between trades our investment manager executed during the quarter and the vendor s pricing. Management reviews the Price Validation report from the investment manager quarterly to check the reasonableness of the investment managers vendor pricing procedures. 
 
 Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs 
 
 Certain acquisition costs consisting of direct and ceded commissions, premium taxes and certain other direct underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies as the underlying policy premiums are earned. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deferred acquisition costs and the related unearned premium reserves were as follows:

Deferred acquisition costs, net 

9,178 

8,552 

Unearned premium reserves, net 

50,521 

46,505 

The method followed in computing deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of deferred costs to their estimated realizable value, which gives effect to the premium to be earned, related investment income, loss and loss adjustment expenses, and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned. Future changes in estimates, the most significant of which is expected loss and loss adjustment expenses, may require adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs. If the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable, they would be written off. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.

Table of Contents 

We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties. Federal tax years 2021 through the current year are open for examination. 
 
 Other Assets 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other assets totaled 2,520,000 and 2,406,000, respectively. Other assets includes intangibles, cash value of officer life insurance, and prepaids. 
 
 Outstanding Debt 
 
 The Company had 15,000,000 in outstanding debt, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company also has borrowing capacity of 53.1 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLBC), which is 25 of net admitted statutory assets of Illinois Casualty Company as of the prior year-end. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has used 15.0 million of that capacity through three separate 5-year term loans expiring between 2025 and 2027, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.21 . One loan for 6.0 million with a 1.4 interest rate expires on March 18, 2025. 
 
 The Company has 18.9 million in bonds pledged as collateral for all FHLBC loans. 
 
 Revolving Line of Credit 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the balance on the line of credit was 0. As of the July 5, 2024 renewal, this line of credit is priced at prime plus 0.54 with a floor of 6.00 and renews annually with a current expiration date of July 5, 2025. The Company has 4.0 million of available credit and has pledged 4.0 million of business assets in the event the Company draws down on the line of credit. This agreement includes an annually calculated financial debt covenant requiring a minimum total adjusted capital of 21.0 million. Total adjusted capital is the sum of an insurer s statutory capital and surplus as determined in accordance with the statutory accounting principles applicable to the annual financial statements required to be filed with Illinois Department of Insurance. There was no interest paid on the line of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Other Liabilities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other liabilities totaled 1,229,000 and 1,259,000, respectively. Other liabilities includes advance premiums and amounts withheld.

ESOP 
 
 In connection with our conversion and public offering, the ESOP financed the purchase of 10.0 of the common stock issued in the offering for 3,500,000 with the proceeds of a loan from ICC prior to the expiration of the offering. ICC makes annual contributions to the ESOP sufficient to repay that loan. See Note 8 Employee Benefits of this Form 10-Q as well as the Management Benefit Plans and Employment Agreements Employee Stock Ownership Plan section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Stock-based Incentive Plan 
 
 Under the ICC Holdings, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, we reserved for issuance a total of 490,000 shares of common stock. Of this amount, 350,000 shares of common stock may be granted in the form of restricted stock and stock-settled restricted stock unit awards, and 140,000 shares of common stock may be granted in the form of stock options under the stock-based incentive plan. The grant-date fair value of any common stock used for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards will represent unearned compensation. As we accrue compensation expense to reflect the vesting of such shares, unearned compensation will be reduced accordingly. We compute compensation expense at the time stock units are awarded based on the fair value of such options on the date they are granted. This compensation expense is recognized over the appropriate service period. Restricted stock units (RSUs) have been granted every year since 2018 and most recently in April 2024. The RSUs vest one third over three years from the first anniversary of the date of grant. See Note 8 Employee Benefits of this Form 10-Q as well as the Management Benefit Plans and Employment Agreements section of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We generate sufficient funds from our operations and maintain a high degree of liquidity in our investment portfolio to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses. The primary sources of funds are premium collections, investment earnings, and maturing investments. We participate in the Insured Cash Sweep (ICS) with our local bank, which maintains our operating accounts. ICS ensures that our funds are spread throughout the ICS network and no balance is higher than 250,000 each night so that all our funds are fully insured. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased by 5.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was due to increases in premiums and reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance balances recoverable offset by decreases in unpaid losses and settlement expenses and unearned premiums. 
 
 We maintain investment and reinsurance programs that are intended to provide sufficient funds to meet our obligations without forced sales of investments. We maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short-term and highly liquid assets to ensure the availability of funds. 
 
 In addition to the investment and reinsurance programs mentioned, we have access to cash via the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago of 48.2 million. We have drawn down 15.0 million as of September 30, 2024. We also have a 4.0 million line of credit with a local financial institution. As of September 30, 2024, our balance on the line of credit was 0. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have cash and other investments maturing within one year of 25.5 million and an additional 47.4 million maturing between one and five years. 
 
 ICC is a limited partner of Mutual Capital Investment Fund MCIF ), which is an affiliate of MCH. MCH has advised the Company that MCIF will be providing funding for a portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration and, accordingly, ICC will receive a capital call in connection with the foregoing funding obligation, which is expected to be approximately 1.6 million. 
 
 One FHLBC loan for 6.0 million with a 1.4 interest rate expires on March 18, 2025 and will be repaid at that time. The maturity of this note is the main reason we are retaining additional cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024. We are earning nearly the same interest on the cash and cash equivalents as we would with fixed maturity securities. 
 
 We believe that over the next twelve to twenty-four months our cash generated from operations and investments will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our needs. The actual timing of gross loss and loss adjustment expense payments is unknown and therefore our timing estimates are based on historical experience and the expectations of future payment patterns. In the event our cash from operations and investments are not sufficient, we believe our cash available from financing activities will be sufficient to cover our cash flow needs. 
 
 Cash flows from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

ICC Holdings, Inc. s principal source of liquidity is dividend payments and other fees received from ICC, Beverage Insurance Agency Inc., Katkin, and Two Rivers Realty Investments. ICC is restricted by the insurance laws of Illinois as to the amount of dividends or other distributions it may pay to us. Under Illinois law, there is a maximum amount that may be paid by ICC during any twelve-month period. ICC may pay dividends to us after notice to, but without prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance in an amount not to exceed the greater of (i) 10 of the surplus as regards policyholders of ICC as reported on its most recent annual statement filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance, or (ii) the statutory net income of ICC for the period covered by such annual statement. Dividends in excess of this amount are considered extraordinary and are subject to the approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance. 
 
 The amount available for payment of dividends from ICC in 2024 without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance is approximately 6.3 million based upon the insurance company s 2023 annual statement. Prior to its payment of any dividend, ICC is required to provide notice of the dividend to the Illinois Department of Insurance. This notice must be provided to the Illinois Department of Insurance 30 days prior to the payment of an extraordinary dividend and 10 days prior to the payment of an ordinary dividend. The Illinois Department of Insurance has the power to limit or prohibit dividend payments if ICC is in violation of any law or regulation. These restrictions or any subsequently imposed restrictions may affect our future liquidity. ICC paid 900,000 and 1,250,000 in dividends to ICC Holdings, Inc. in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The estimated transaction costs related to the merger are substantial and may require an additional dividend from ICC this year.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We have exposure to three principal types of market risk through our investment activities: interest rate risk, credit risk, and equity risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates. We have not entered, and do not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for hedging, trading, or speculative purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value of these securities. 
 
 The average maturity of the debt securities in our investment portfolio was 8.2 and 8.6 years as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our debt securities investments include U.S. government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities, and corporate bonds, most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates, and which may experience moderate fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates. We carry these investments as available-for-sale. This allows us to manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by our management and board of directors and consultation with our third-party investment manager. 
 
 Fluctuations in near-term interest rates could have an impact on the results of operations and cash flows. Certain of these securities may have call features. In a declining interest rate environment these securities may be called by their issuer and replaced with securities bearing lower interest rates. If we are required to sell these securities in a rising interest rate environment, we may recognize losses. 
 
 As a general matter, we attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities. Our investment objectives include maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operational needs, optimizing our after-tax investment income, and our after-tax total return, all of which are subject to our tolerance for risk. 
 
 The table below shows the interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity investments measured in terms of fair value (which is equal to the carrying value for all our investment securities that are subject to interest rate changes):

1 Assumes US rates are floored at 0 . 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer. We address this risk by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that are rated investment grade and require the fixed income portfolio to maintain an average credit quality of A+ or better. We also independently, and through our independent third-party investment manager, monitor the financial condition of all the issuers of fixed maturity securities in the portfolio. To limit our exposure to risk, we employ diversification rules that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or asset class.

Equity Risk 
 
 Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that required information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required timeframe as specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as of September 30, 2024, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
