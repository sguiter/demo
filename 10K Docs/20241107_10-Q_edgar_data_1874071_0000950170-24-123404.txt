The amendments improve the disclosures about a public business entity's expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) in commonly present expense captions (such as costs of sales and research and development). The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on our consolidated financial statements.

Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Below are the definitions of the internally assigned risk ratings: Strong Pass Loans to a new or existing borrower collateralized at least percent by an unimpaired deposit account at the Company. 

 Good Pass Loans to a new or existing borrower in a well-established enterprise in excellent financial condition with strong liquidity and a history of consistently high level of earnings, cash flow and debt service capacity. 

 Satisfactory Pass Loans to a new or existing borrower of average strength with acceptable financial condition, satisfactory record of earnings and sufficient historical and projected cash flow to service the debt. 

 Performance Pass Existing loans that evidence strong payment history but document less than average strength, financial condition, record of earnings, or projected cash flows with which to service the debt. 

 Special Mention Loans in this category are currently protected but show one or more potential weaknesses and risks which may inadequately protect collectability or borrower s ability to meet repayment terms at some future date if the weakness or weaknesses are not monitored or remediated.

Loans are considered impaired when current information and events indicate all amounts due may not be collectable according to the contractual terms of the related loan agreements. Impaired loans are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for credit losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment.

 and troubled debt restructured loans totaling million and million of which million and million are on accrual status, respectively. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. At September 30, 2024, there was loan in the amount of million that was modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. At December 31, 2023, there were modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain Technologies, Inc. ("Grain"). Grain s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its former agreement with Grain, the Bank was the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originated and serviced these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan was found to be fraudulent, became 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaulted due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank s applicable standards for origination or servicing were deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan was put back to Grain, who then became responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain were accounted for as an other asset, specifically referred to herein as the Grain Receivable. On November 1, 2023, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Grain signed a Perpetual Software License Agreement in order for the Bank to assume the servicing of the remaining microloans. In order to facilitate the transfer of the servicing responsibilities to the Bank, Grain granted the Bank a perpetual right and license to use the Grain software, including the source code to service the remaining loans. At September 30, 2024 , the Bank had microloans outstanding with an aggregate balance totaling million and which were performing, in management s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an million allowance for credit losses, resulting in million in microloans. From inception of the microloan arrangement through September 30, 2024 , microloans amounting to million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of million, net of recoveries, of the microloans receivable and received million in cash. The Bank also opted to use the million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department s Rapid Response Program to defray the microloans receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company s total microloans exposure was million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding million of security deposits by microloan borrowers. The million of recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the million recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to microloans is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Off-Balance Sheet Credit Losses Also included within the scope of the CECL standard are off-balance sheet loan commitments, which includes the unfunded portion of committed lines of credit and construction loans. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk through a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The Company uses similar assumptions and risk factors that are developed for collectively evaluated financing receivables. This estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments to be funded over its estimated life. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses was million and million, respectively, which is included in the "Other liabilities" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had million in benefit for credit losses and million in provision for credit losses, respectively, and million in benefit for credit losses and million in provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for off-balance-sheet items, which are included in "(Benefit) provision for contingencies" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

derivative financial instruments contracts to enhance its ability to manage interest rate risk that exist as part of its ongoing operations. The Company manages these risks as part of its asset and liability management process. The Company utilized derivative financial instruments to accommodate the business needs and to hedge the exposure that this creates for the Company. All derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Swaps The Bank is a party to two interest rate swap transactions designated as fair value hedges. One interest rate swap is for a period of effective and terminates on with a notional amount of million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of and receive the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate. The other interest rate swap is for a period of effective and terminates on with a notional amount of million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of and receive the SOFR rate.

Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 

Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions.

 open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of September 30, 2024. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Unfunded Commitments with Oaktree : In December of 2021, the Bank committed to invest million in Oaktree SBIC Fund, L.P. ("Oaktree"). As of September 30, 2024 , the total unfunded commitment was million. Unfunded Commitments with Silvergate : In April of 2022, the Company committed to invest million in EJF Silvergate Ventures Fund LP ("Silvergate"). As of September 30, 2024 , the total unfunded commitment was million. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by residential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

 million and the aggregate unpaid principal amounted to million. Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Derivatives : The Company works directly with a third-party vendor to provide periodic valuations for its interest-rate risk-management agreements to determine fair value of its interest rate swaps executed for interest-rate risk management. The vendor utilizes standard valuation methodologies applicable to interest rate derivatives based on readily observable market data and are therefore considered Level 2 valuations. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and standby letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the valuation hierarchy at the end of the applicable reporting periods. There were transfers of Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Fair value for Level 3 securities was determined using a third-party pricing service with limited levels of activity and price transparency. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate are insignificant at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2024 and 2023 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful.

Ponce Bank, through its Mortgage World division, is subject to various net worth requirements in connection with lending agreements that Ponce Bank has entered with purchase facility lenders. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in the Bank s Mortgage World division being unable to originate and service loans, and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank was in compliance with the applicable minimum capital requirements specified above.

 Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending 
 
 Emergency Capital Investment Program 
 On June 7, 2022, the Company closed a private placement (the Private Placement of 225,000 shares of the Company s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A , par value 0.01 (the Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to 225.0 million in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the Treasury pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program ECIP ). The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50 and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00 , based on achievement of certain qualified lending targets. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. 
 
 The Company began paying dividends on its Preferred Stock during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as required by the terms thereof. The Bank exceeded the dividend rate reduction threshold for qualified lending targets designated by the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to the ECIP. The Bank's qualified lending as measured pursuant to ECIP totaled 1.162 billion from June 8, 2023 through March 31, 2024. This reduces the dividend obligation on the Preferred Stock to 0.50 for the quarterly dividends payable through June 2025. 
 The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over 8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution CDFI or Minority Depository Institution MDI ), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. 
 CDFI Equitable Recovery Program 
 
 On September 26, 2023, the Bank received a 3.7 million grant from the U.S. Treasury as part of the CDFI Equitable Recovery Program ("ERP") which aims to help CDFI's further their mission of helping low and low-to-moderate income communities recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table of Contents 

On November 6, 2023, the Bank received a 0.5 million grant as part of the Bank Enterprise Award Program from the CDFI. Awards under the Bank Enterprise Award Program are subject to the program terms and must be used for qualified activities, which include providing loans, investments and financial services to residents and businesses in distressed communities. 
 
 Derivatives and Hedging 
 
 During 2023, the Company entered into two derivative financial instruments contracts to enhance its ability to manage interest rate risk that exist as part of its ongoing operations. The Company manages these risks as part of its asset and liability management process. The Company utilized derivative financial instruments to accommodate the business needs and to hedge the exposure that this creates for the Company. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 The Bank is a party to two interest rate swap transactions. One interest rate swap is for a period of two years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2025 with a notional amount of 150.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.885 and receive the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate. The other interest rate swap is for a period of three years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2026 with a notional amount of 100.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.62 and receive the SOFR rate. 
 
 Banking Development District 
 
 The Ponce Bank Westchester Avenue Branch located at 2244 Westchester Avenue in the Castle Hill area of the Bronx was approved as a Banking Development District ("BDD"). New York State s BDD Program, administered by the Department of Financial Services ("DFS"), supports the establishment of bank and credit union branches in areas across New York State where there is a demonstrated need for banking services. To encourage participation, approved BDD branches receive access to subsidized and market rate deposits from New York State. On July 30, 2024, Ponce Bank received total program deposits of 35.0 million. 
 
 Coral Gables, Florida Office 
 
 On June 1, 2024, Ponce Bank opened its first-ever representative office in the state of Florida located at 1600 Ponce de Leon Drive in the Miami suburb of Coral Gables. This new office is home to a Commercial Relationship Officer who will split time between the new location and his former Bergen County, New Jersey territory. Many of our customers have businesses in Florida or spend their winter months here, and the large Hispanic community fits one of our primary demographics. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses. 
 The allowance for credit losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. Credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. If our loss rate factor was to increase 10 basis points, our reserve would increase by approximately 2.2 million. Likewise, if our loss rate factor was to decrease 10 basis points, our reserve would decrease by approximately 2.2 million. 
 The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.

In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its former agreement with Grain, the Bank was the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to 1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originated and serviced these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan was found to be fraudulent, became 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaulted due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank s applicable standards for origination or servicing were deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan was put back to Grain, who then became responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain were accounted for as an other asset, specifically referred to herein as the Grain Receivable. 
 On November 1, 2023, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Grain signed a Perpetual Software License Agreement in order for the Bank to assume the servicing of the remaining microloans. In order to facilitate the transfer of the servicing responsibilities to the Bank, Grain granted the Bank a perpetual right and license to use the Grain software, including the source code to service the remaining loans. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 8,428 microloans outstanding with an aggregate balance totaling 3.0 million and which were performing, in management s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an 2.6 million allowance for credit losses, resulting in 0.5 million in microloans. From inception of the microloan arrangement through September 30, 2024, 45,322 microloans amounting to 24.0 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of 15.3 million, net of recoveries, of the microloans receivable and received 6.8 million in cash. The Bank also opted to use the 1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department s Rapid Response Program to defray the microloans receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of 1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s total microloans exposure was 0.5 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding 1.5 million of security deposits by microloan borrowers. The 0.2 million of recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the 1.3 million recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to microloans is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Vision 2025 Evolves 
 
 The Company has deployed a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. 
 
 The Company also established a relationship with Raisin Solutions US LLC ("Raisin") (formerly known as SaveBetter, LLC), a fintech startup focusing on deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 600.6 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules enables the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. 
 
 On October 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC ("Bamboo"), pursuant to which the Company purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing 19.84 of the total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for an investment of 4.4 million. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. 
 
 At December 31, 2018, the first year after our initial public offering, the Company had approximately 1.06 billion in assets, 918.5 million in loans and 809.8 million in deposits. The Company has since grown to 3.02 billion in assets, 2.18 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of 24.0 million, and 1.87 billion in deposits at September 30, 2024, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, diversifying its product offering and partnering with Fintech companies. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. 
 
 On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company s Preferred Stock , par value 0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to 225.0 million in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury s ECIP . Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital. No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0 , 1.25 or 0.5 and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. The Company began paying dividends on its Preferred Stock during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as required by the terms thereof. The Bank exceeded the dividend rate reduction threshold for qualified lending targets designated by the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to the ECIP. The Bank's qualified lending as measured pursuant to ECIP totaled 1.162 billion from June 8, 2023 through March 31, 2024. This reduces the dividend obligation on the Preferred Stock to 0.50 for the quarterly dividends payable through June 2025. 
 
 Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Company has the option to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within ninety days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as defined below, in each case at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation amount, with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date. The Company may not redeem shares of Preferred Stock without having received the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the Company, as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent required under applicable capital rules. Such redemptions are subject to certain conditions and limitations. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. 
 
 A Regulatory Capital Treatment Event means a good-faith determination that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any agency or instrumentality of the United States, including the Federal Reserve and other appropriate federal bank regulatory agencies) that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws, rules or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; or (iii) any official administrative or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws, rules or regulations or policies with respect thereto that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that we will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preferences of the shares of Preferred Stock then

Part 217 (or, as and if applicable, the successor capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of the Federal Reserve or the capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding.

(1) As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consumer loans include 3.0 million and 8.0 million of microloans. 

Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57.2 and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. 
 
 Multifamily residential loans increased 127.5 million, or 23.2 , and nonresidential properties loans increased 40.9 million, or 12.0 , when compared to December 31, 2023. The majority of the increases in multifamily residential loans and nonresidential properties loans that were refinanced from construction and land loans to a new permanent loan facility. 
 
 The majority of the 127.5 million growth in construction and land mortgage loans is related to funding of existing commitments prior to 2024 as opposed to new originations in 2024. Our commitments to grant new mortgage loans decreased by 102.1 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. See Note 11 ("Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk") of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Within the construction and land mortgage loans, as indicated in the composition of gross loans receivable table above, there are 17 projects at 100 completion, with balances of 104.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Of these 17 projects, five have been issued a certificate of occupancy, 10 have been issued a temporary certificate of occupancy and two are pending certificate of occupancy . 
 Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 4.4 and 5.3 , respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. 
 
 Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100 and 300 of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank s policy is to operate within the 150 guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 450 for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 125.4 and 102.5 , respectively. Investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 321.3 and 269.1 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Bank was above the 100 guidelines established by the banking regulations but under the 150 guidelines set by the Bank for construction and land mortgage loans and above the 300 guideline established by banking regulators but under the 450 guidelines set by the Bank for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank s lending in these areas. 
 Loans Held For Sale . Loans held for sale, at fair value, at September 30, 2024 decreased 0.4 million, or 4.1 , to 9.6 million from 10.0 million at December 31, 2023.

When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. 
 
 Borrowings . The Bank had outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024 of 580.4 million in term advances from the FHLBNY and at December 31, 2023 380.4 million in term advances from the FHLBNY and 304.0 million in term advances from the FRBNY. The Bank did not have any term advances from the FRBNY at September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Bank had two unsecured lines of credit in the amount of 75.0 million with two correspondent banks for both periods at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, under which there was nothing outstanding at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Stockholders Equity . The Company s consolidated stockholders equity increased 13.2 million, or 2.69 , to 504.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from 491.4 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase in stockholders equity was largely attributable to 8.0 million in net income, 3.0 million in other comprehensive income, 1.6 million impact to additional paid in capital as a result of share-based compensation and 1.0 million from release of ESOP shares, offset by 0.4 million in preferred stock dividend for shares issued pursuant to the ECIP. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 The discussion of the Company s results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. 
 
 Overview. Net income available to common stockholders was 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income available to common stockholders of 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per basic and diluted share was 0.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of 0.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.4 million decrease of net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was largely due to a decrease of 4.5 million in non-interest income as a result of a 3.7 million grant reported in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 0.3 million in provision for credit losses and an increase of 0.3 million in dividend payments on preferred stock, partially offset by an increase of 2.5 million in net interest income and decreases of 1.1 million in provision for income taxes and 1.0 million in non-interest expense. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which excludes 0.3 million in dividend payments and accruals on preferred shares, was 2.4 million.

Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 2.5 million, or 15.0 , to 19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.5 million increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to an increase of 7.8 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable, offset by an increase of 5.3 million in interest expense. 
 
 Net interest rate spread increased by 10 basis point to 1.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.67 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the net interest rate spread for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 53 basis points to 5.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 43 basis points to 3.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.55 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest margin increased 7 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.65 from 2.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that the target range for the federal funds rate decreased by 50 basis points to 4.75 -5.00 effective on September 19, 2024. It marked the first rate cut in over four years and signaled a shift in strategy aimed at bolstering the economy and preventing a rise in unemployment. Our net interest income may be positively impacted if the demand for loans increases due to the lower rates, alone or in tandem with lower inflation. 
 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased 4.5 million, or 79.5 to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to 3.7 million in grants reported in the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 0.8 million in late and prepayment charges.

The 1.0 million decrease in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to decreases of 0.6 million in provision for contingencies, 0.5 million in data processing expenses and 0.3 million in professional fees, partially offset by increases of 0.2 million in direct loan expenses, 0.2 million in occupancy and equipment and 0.1 million in compensation and benefits.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on the Company s net interest income for the periods indicated. The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The discussion of the Company s results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. 
 Overview. Net income available to common stockholders was 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income available to common stockholders of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per basic and diluted share was 0.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of 0.12 for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 4.8 million increase of net income available to common stockholders from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to an increase of 7.7 million in net interest income and decreases of 1.3 million in non-interest expense and 1.1 million in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease of 3.8 million in non-interest income, as a result of 3.7 million grants received in third quarter of 2023, and increases of 1.1 million in provision for income taxes and 0.4 million in dividends on preferred shares. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which excludes 0.4 million in dividends on preferred shares, was 8.0 million.

The 7.7 million increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to an increase of 28.8 million in total interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable, offset by an increase of 21.2 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. 
 Net interest rate spread increased by 3 basis points to 1.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the net interest rate spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to and an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 70 basis points to 5.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , offset by an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 68 basis points to 3.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest margin increased 1 basis point for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 2.66 from 2.65 for nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased 3.8 million, or 42.8 , to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 3.8 million decrease in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to 3.7 million related to grants received in the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 1.1 million in late and prepayment charges, partially offset by increases of 0.7 million in other non-interest income and 0.4 million in income on sale of mortgage loans.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on the Company s net interest income for the periods indicated. The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Management of Market Risk 
 General . The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank s Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO") is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. 
 The Bank engages in hedging activities, such as swap transactions. The Bank is a party to two interest rate swap transactions. One interest rate swap is for a period of two years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2025 with a notional amount of 150.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.885 and receive the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate. The other interest rate swap is for a period of three years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2026 with a notional amount of 100.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.62 and receive the SOFR rate (see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest

rates. As of September 30, 2024, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated:

(1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. 

Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 
 
 The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. 
 At September 30, 2024, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. 
 Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model EVE measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At September 30, 2024, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates:

(1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. 

(2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. 

(3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. 

(4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. 

Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the 
 51 

Table of Contents 

discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 
 At September 30, 2024, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. 
 
 Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 
 Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The ALCO Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. 
 Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. 
 The ALCO Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that the target range for the federal funds rate decreased by 50 basis points to 4.75 -5.00 effective on September 19, 2024. It marked the first rate cut in over four years and signaled a shift in strategy aimed at bolstering the economy and preventing a rise in unemployment. The decrease in federal funds rate will be in response to lower inflation as well as a cooler job market. In a lower rate environment, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential positive impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be positively impacted. Our net interest income may also be positively impacted if the demand for loans increases due to the lower rates, alone or in tandem with lower inflation. 
 GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank s interest rate sensitivity "gap." The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. 
 The following table sets forth the Company s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at September 30, 2024, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on 
 53 

Table of Contents 

net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. 
 
 In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. 
 Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. 
 Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. The Bank had 580.4 million and 380.4 million of outstanding term advances from FHLBNY at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank had no overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Net (cash used) provided by in operating activities was 15.7) million and 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchase of loans, net purchase and redemption of FHLBNY stock and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturities, calls and principal repayments on securities was 226.1) million and 240.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in borrowing, deposit accounts and dividends paid on preferred stock, was 258.4 million and 295.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Bank s management took steps to enhance the Company s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans and extend credit of 486.5 million and 591.5 million, respectively. 
 It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in 2024 totaled 329.5 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 
 Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. There have been no material changes in the Company s material cash requirements under its contractual obligations as discussed in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
 Dividend on Preferred Stock . Pursuant to the terms of its Preferred Stock, the Company is required to pay a quarterly dividend on its Preferred Stock, beginning during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The floor dividend rate is 0.50 and the ceiling dividend rate 
 54 

Table of Contents 

is 2.00 , based on achievement of certain qualified lending targets. For quarterly dividends through June 15, 2025, the Company is required to pay quarterly dividends on the Preferred Stock at a rate of 0.50 . 
 Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were 23.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of 1.4 million, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 The information required by this item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this report under Management of Market Risk . 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
