C AUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Selected statements contained in this Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, in MD A and in Note E Contingent Liabilities and Commitments, constitute forward-looking statements, as that term is used in the PSLRA. We wish to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions included in the PSLRA. Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events. These statements are often identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as believe, expect, anticipate, may, could, should, would, intend, plan, will, likely, estimate, project, position, strategy, target, aim, seek, foresee, and other similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements relating to: 
 
 future or expected cash positions, liquidity and ability to access financial markets and capital; 

outlook, strategy or business plans; 

anticipated benefits of the Separation; 

expected financial and operational performance, and future opportunities, following the Separation; 

performance on a pro forma basis to illustrate the estimated effects of the Separation on historical periods; 

the tax treatment of the Separation transaction; 

future or expected growth, growth potential, forward momentum, performance, competitive position, sales, volumes, cash flows, earnings, margins, balance sheet strengths, debt, financial condition or other financial measures; 

pricing trends for raw materials and finished goods and the impact of pricing changes; 

the ability to improve or maintain margins; 

expected demand or demand trends;

anticipated improvements and efficiencies in costs, operations, sales, inventory management, sourcing and the supply chain and the results thereof; 

projected profitability potential; 

the ability to make acquisitions, form joint ventures and consolidate operations, and the projected timing, results, benefits, costs, charges and expenditures related to acquisitions, joint ventures, headcount reductions and facility dispositions, shutdowns and consolidations; 

projected capacity and the alignment of operations with demand; 

the ability to operate profitably and generate cash in down markets; 

the ability to capture and maintain market share and to develop or take advantage of future opportunities, customer initiatives, new businesses, new products and new markets; 

expectations for inventories, jobs and orders; 

expectations for the economy and markets or improvements therein; 

expectations for generating improving and sustainable earnings, earnings potential, margins or shareholder value; 

effects of judicial rulings, laws and regulations; 

effects of cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions to information technology infrastructure; 

the lingering effects of COVID-19 on economies and markets, and on our customers, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers; and 

other non-historical matters. 

Because they are based on beliefs, estimates and assumptions, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Any number of factors could affect actual results, including, without limitation, those that follow: 
 
 the ability to successfully realize the anticipated benefits of the Separation; 

the effect of conditions in national and worldwide financial markets, including inflation, increases in interest rates and economic recession, and with respect to the ability of financial institutions to provide capital;

the effect of disruption in the business of suppliers, customers, facilities and shipping operations due to adverse weather, casualty events, equipment breakdowns, labor shortages, interruption in utility services, civil unrest, international conflicts, terrorist activities, or other causes; 

changes in customer demand, inventories, spending patterns, product choices, and supplier choices; 

risks associated with doing business internationally, including economic, political and social instability, foreign currency exchange rate exposure and the acceptance of our products in global markets; 

the ability to improve and maintain processes and business practices to keep pace with the economic, competitive and technological environment; 

the effect of inflation, interest rate increases and economic recession, which may negatively impact our operations and financial results;

the effect of healthcare laws in the U.S and potential changes for such laws which may increase our healthcare and other costs and negatively impact our operations and financial results; 

the effects of tax laws in the U.S and potential changes for such laws, which may increase our costs and negatively impact our operations and financial results; 

cyber security risks; 

the effects of privacy and information security laws and standards; 

the seasonality of our operations; and 

other risks described from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including those described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2024 Form 10-K. 

We note these risk factors for investors as contemplated by the PSLRA. Forward-looking statements should be construed in the light of such risks. It is impossible to predict or identify all potential risk factors. Consequently, readers should not consider the foregoing list to be a complete set of all potential risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We do not undertake, and hereby disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND DEFINITIONS 
 (In thousands, except per common share amounts) 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES . This Form 10-Q includes certain financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures typically exclude items that management believes are not reflective of, and thus should not be included when evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations. Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information and additional perspective on the performance of our ongoing operations and should not be considered as an alternative to the comparable GAAP financial measure. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business and enables investors to evaluate our operations and future prospects in the same manner as management. 
 
 The following provides an explanation of each non-GAAP measure presented in this Form 10-Q: 
 
 Adjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) excluding the items listed below, to the extent naturally included in operating income (loss). 
 
 Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations is defined as adjusted net earnings from continuing operations divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. 
 
 EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is further adjusted to exclude impairment and restructuring charges (gains) as well as other items that management believes are not reflective of, and thus should not be included when evaluating the performance of its ongoing operations, as outlined below. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations also excludes stock-based compensation due to its non-cash nature, which is consistent with how management assesses operating performance. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations includes expense allocations for centralized corporate back-office functions that exist to support the day-to-day business operations. Public company and other governance costs are held at the corporate level. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by net sales. 
 
 EXCLUSIONS FROM NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from its non-GAAP measures for its own and investors assessment of the business for the reasons identified below: 
 Impairment charges are excluded because they do not occur in the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations, are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and are non-cash, which we believe facilitates the comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. 

Restructuring and other expense (income), net , which can result in both discrete gains and/or losses, consist of established programs that are not part of our ongoing operations, such as divestitures, closing or consolidating facilities, employee severance (including rationalizing headcount or other significant changes in personnel), and realignment of existing operations (including changes to management structure in response to underlying performance and/or changing market conditions). These items are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business. 

Separation costs , which consist of direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the completed Separation, are excluded as they are one-time in nature and are not expected to occur in periods following the Separation. These costs include fees paid to third-party advisors, such as investment banking, audit and other advisory services as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the separation of shared corporate functions. Results in fiscal 2024 also include incremental compensation expense associated with the modification of unvested short and long-term incentive compensation awards, as required under the employee matters agreement executed in conjunction with the Separation. 

Loss on extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions. 

Pension settlement charges are excluded because of their non-cash nature and the fact that they do not occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. These transactions typically result from the transfer of all or a portion of the total projected benefit obligation to third-party insurance companies. 

Corporate costs eliminated at Separation reflect certain corporate overhead costs that no longer exist post-Separation. These costs were included in continuing operations as they represent general corporate overhead that was historically allocated to our former steel processing business but did not meet the requirements to be presented as discontinued operations.

Halo is consolidated with the equity owned by the other joint venture members shown as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets, and the other joint venture members portions of net earnings and OCI are shown as net earnings or comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, respectively. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates that we do not control are accounted for using the equity method with our proportionate share of income or loss recognized within equity income in our consolidated statements of earnings. See further discussion of our unconsolidated affiliates in Note C Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature except those which have been disclosed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for these interim periods, have been included. Operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2024 Form 10-K. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Separation of the Steel Processing Business On December 1, 2023, we completed the spin-off of our former steel processing business into an independent publicly traded company, Worthington Steel, on a tax-free basis. Accordingly, the operating results of the former steel processing business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, as discussed in further detail in Note B Discontinued Operations. All discussion within this Form 10-Q, including amounts, percentages and disclosures for all periods presented, reflect only our continuing operations unless otherwise noted. In connection with the Separation, we entered into several agreements with Worthington Steel that govern our ongoing relationships, the most significant of which is the long-term Steel Supply Agreement. Other agreements include a long-term Steel Supply Agreement, a Trademark License Agreement, and Transition Services Agreement. Amounts under the Trademark License Agreement and Transition Services Agreement were not significant during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Pursuant to the long-term Steel Supply Agreement, Worthington Steel manufactures and supplies to us, at reasonable market rates, certain flat rolled steel products, and will provide us with certain related support services such as design, engineering/technical services, price risk management, scrap management, steel purchasing, supply chain optimization and product rework services, and other services at our request that are ancillary to the supply of the flat rolled steel products. Purchases from Worthington Steel under this agreement for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 , totaled , of which was payable at August 31, 2024. Revenue Recognition We recognize all revenue at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery.

We have received cumulative distributions from WAVE in excess of our investment balance, which resulted in a negative asset balance of and at August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we have reclassified the negative balances to distributions in excess of investment in unconsolidated affiliate within our consolidated balance sheets. We will continue to record our equity in the net income of WAVE as a debit to the investment account, and if it becomes positive, it will again be shown as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets. If it becomes probable that any excess distribution may not be returned (upon joint venture liquidation or otherwise), we will immediately recognize any balance classified as a liability as income. We use the cumulative earnings approach to determine the cash flow presentation of distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures. Distributions received are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities unless the cumulative distributions exceed our share of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the joint venture. In such cases, the excess distributions are considered returns of investment and are classified as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. distributions exceeded our share in any of our unconsolidated joint ventures during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

of the common shares. On March 24, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional of the common shares, increasing the total number of common shares then authorized for repurchase to . The total number of common shares available for repurchase under these authorizations at August 31, 2024 was . These common shares may be repurchased from time to time, with consideration given to the market price of the common shares, the nature of other investment opportunities, cash flows from operations, general economic conditions and other relevant considerations. Repurchases may be made on the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions.

Service-Based Restricted Common Shares During the three months ended August 31, 2024 , we granted an aggregate of service-based restricted common shares under our stock-based compensation plans, which cliff vest from the grant date. The fair value of these restricted common shares was equal to the weighted average closing market price of the underlying common shares on the grant date, or per share. The calculated pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for these restricted common shares of will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, net of any forfeitures. Performance Share Awards We have awarded performance shares to certain key employees under our stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding performance share awards may be earned based on the level of achievement of corporate targets for cumulative corporate economic value added and EPS growth and, in the case of business unit executives, a business unit adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations target, in each case for the three-year periods ending May 31, 2025, 2026 and 2027. These performance share awards will be paid, to the extent earned, in common shares in the fiscal quarter following the end of the applicable three-year performance period. The fair values of our performance shares are determined by the closing market prices of the underlying common shares at the respective grant dates of the performance shares and the pre-tax stock-based compensation expense is based on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate of the number of common shares that will ultimately be issued. The ultimate pre-tax stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the three-year performance period on all tranches will vary based on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved. During the three months ended August 31, 2024 , we granted performance share awards covering an aggregate of common shares (at target levels). The calculated pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for these performance shares is (at target levels). The ultimate pre-tax stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the performance period on all tranches will vary based on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved.

The earnout agreement provides for additional cash consideration of up to should certain earnings targets be met through calendar year 2024. Ragasco operates as part of the Building Products operating segment and its results have been included in our consolidated statements of earnings since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results, including the acquired business since the beginning of fiscal 2023, would not be materially different from reported results. The information included herein is based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price using estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired. The purchase price allocation is subject to further adjustment until all pertinent information regarding the assets acquired is fully evaluated by us, including but not limited to, the fair value accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their estimated acquisition-date fair values, with goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. The purchase price includes the fair values of other assets that were not identifiable, not separately recognizable under accounting rules (e.g., assembled workforce) or of immaterial value. The purchase price also includes strategic and synergistic benefits (i.e., investment value) specific to us, which resulted in a purchase price in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets. This additional investment value resulted in goodwill, which is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their estimated acquisition-date fair values, with goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.

Cash Flow Hedges We enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate and commodity price fluctuations associated with certain forecasted transactions. These derivative financial instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of the gain or loss on each of these derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

The estimated amount of the net gains recognized in AOCI at August 31, 2024, expected to be reclassified into net earnings within the succeeding 12 months is (net of tax of ). This amount was computed using the fair value of the cash flow hedges at August 31, 2024, and will change before actual reclassification from OCI to net earnings during the fiscal years ending May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2026. Net Investment Hedges We have designated our Euro-denominated debt held in the U.S. with a principal as a non-derivative net investment hedge of our foreign operations in Portugal. Accordingly, the foreign currency effects resulting from the remeasurement of this debt have been deferred in AOCI as an offset to the translation of our net investment in Portugal. A remeasurement loss of was deferred in AOCI during the three months ended August 31, 2024. Economic (Non-designated) Hedges We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency exchange rate exposure related to inter-company and financing transactions that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. We also enter into certain commodity contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, these derivative financial instruments are adjusted to current market value at the end of each period through gain (loss) recognized in earnings.

Recent Business Developments 
 On June 3, 2024, we acquired Ragasco, a leading global manufacturer of composite propane cylinders based in Norway. The purchase price included cash consideration of approximately 102.2 million, with a future earnout opportunity of up to 14.0 million. The results of Ragasco are included within the Building Products operating segment for periods subsequent to the acquisition date. See Note N Acquisitions for additional information. 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we repurchased 150,000 common shares under existing repurchase authorizations for 6.8 million, at an average purchase price of 45.35. 

On September 24, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.17 per common share payable on December 27, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 13, 2024.

Trends and Factors Impacting our Performance 
 
 The following trends and factors have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results. 
 
 End Markets and Competition 
 
 We offer a wide range of products and services to a diverse customer base across various end markets. These markets include residential construction, non-residential construction, and repair and remodeling, which drive demand in our Building Products operating segment, including our unconsolidated joint ventures, WAVE and ClarkDietrich. Additionally, tools, outdoor living, and celebrations drive demand in our Consumer Products operating segment, including our consolidated joint venture, Halo. Given the extensive range of products and services we provide, our competitors vary by industry, product type, service type, program size, and geography. Competition is primarily based on price, product quality, brand recognition, product innovation, and customer service. Sales to one customer in the Consumer Products operating segment accounted for 13 of our consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Trends and factors impacting each of our end markets are described in additional detail below. 
 
 General Economic and Market Conditions 
 
 U.S. GDP growth rate trends typically reflect the strength of demand and, in many cases, pricing for our products. A year-over-year increase in U.S. GDP growth rates generally signals a stronger economy and higher demand and pricing for our products. Conversely, declining U.S. GDP growth rates usually indicate a weaker economy and reduced demand and pricing our products. Fluctuations in U.S. GDP growth rates can affect conversion costs related to production and SG A. 
 
 The macroeconomic and geopolitical outlook has been complex and evolving. Although the U.S. economy continues to grow at a modest pace, prolonged inflationary pressures continue to negatively impact the discretionary spending of many of our customers. The recent 0.50 rate cut by the Federal Reserve is expected to alleviate some of this pressure in the near-term as borrowing becomes cheaper, stimulating spending in our residential construction, non-residential construction, and repair and remodel end markets. Besides inflation, consumer spending habits for our products are influenced by prevailing global economic conditions, the costs of basic necessities and other goods, employment levels, salaries and wage rates, and prevailing interest rates. Additionally, consumer purchasing patterns are generally affected by consumers disposable income, credit availability, and debt levels. 
 
 We also actively monitor other publicly available macroeconomic trends that provide insight into the activity in our end markets. These trends include, but are not limited to, the ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index, the HMI, steel prices, retail sales, state and local government spending, interest rate environment and inflation metrics. Current macro-economic trends within our end markets are described in additional detail below, as well as selected key indicators for the periods presented.

Residential Construction : The near-term outlook for U.S. residential construction spending remains cautiously optimistic, with spending increasing by approximately 7.4 between August 2024 and August 2023. While construction data continues to show positive year-over-year growth, housing starts and authorized permits remain flat, reflecting a cautious approach by both builders and potential home buyers. The HMI also fell to 39.0 in August 2024, indicating persistent challenges such as high mortgage rates and elevated home prices. Builders continue to grapple with high interest rates for construction loans and ongoing labor shortages, which are impacting their ability to meet demand. Additionally, rising material costs add further pressure on the end market. However, we are optimistic that recent interest rate cuts could spur new construction activity in the near term and we remain well-positioned to meet the anticipated demand. More broadly, the solid underlying fundamentals of the housing market, including favorable demographics and a chronic undersupply of homes, provide strong support for this end market in the long-term. 
 
 Non-residential Construction : The near-term outlook for U.S. non-residential construction is mixed. The ABI fell to 45.7 in August 2024 from 48.1 in August 2023, indicating a continued decline in demand for architectural services. This marks the nineteenth consecutive month of declining billings, reflecting ongoing challenges in converting project inquiries into actual contracts. However, the Dodge Momentum Index offers a more optimistic view, rising to 220.4 in August 2024 from 178.0 in August 2023, driven by gains in both commercial and institutional planning. This suggests that while current billings are down, there is a pipeline of projects that could bolster future construction activity. Overall, the sector faces headwinds but also holds potential for growth as economic conditions stabilize and interest rates are expected to decrease. 
 
 Repair and Remodel : Spending on home improvement is expected to continue declining in the near term as existing home sales remain at multi-decade lows. Although the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate decreased to 6.35 at August 31, 2024, from 7.18 at August 31, 2023, this decline isn t significant enough to entice most buyers to enter the market or leave their existing lower fixed rate mortgages. Despite these challenges, the long-term outlook remains strong as interest rates are expected to decline further and the aging housing stock will drive the need for renovations. As economic conditions stabilize, we expect homeowners to access their record levels of equity and drive spending in the long-term. 
 
 Tools : Spending in the tools end market is predominantly influenced by macroeconomic conditions. Recently, the market has experienced positive tailwinds as inflation has eased, with the annual inflation rate dropping to 2.5 in August 2024, a significant decrease from its peak in 2022. Despite moderating inflation, overall demand in this sector continued to be adversely affected by a general moderation in consumer spending on non-essential items, resulting in lower overall demand from both DIY and professional customers. Notwithstanding these short-term headwinds, we believe that the outlook remains positive as we continue to grow market share with our well-known brands and innovation of new products. 
 
 Outdoor Living : Participation in outdoor recreation is beginning to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. This trend is evident in the number of new U.S. camping households, a key metric that measures the influx of first-time campers. After peaking in 2020, driven by the desire for safe, socially-distanced activities during the height of the pandemic, the number has steadily declined. However, the long-term fundamentals in the outdoor living category remain positive, driven by diverse participation across different age groups, socio-economic classes, and geographic regions. 
 
 Celebrations : The celebrations end market has shown a gradual recovery, propelled by the increasing demand for personalized and unique event experiences. Consumer income and the debt-to-income ratio have gradually recovered, approaching levels observed prior to COVID-19, alongside moderating inflation. Despite these positive indicators, inflation and interest rates continue to influence disposable income and spending power. It is anticipated that consumer spending on non-essential items will remain constrained, primarily due to a larger share of income being allocated towards essential purchases and mortgage payments. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Historically, sales tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year for our Consumer Products operating segment when our facilities perform at seasonal peaks, matching consumer demand. Sales in our Building Products operating segment are generally stronger in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year due to weather conditions, customer business cycles, and the timing of renovation and new construction projects. Demand in our Building Products operating segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was not reflective of the cyclical strength we typically see in in the first quarter of our fiscal year due to continued destocking at certain distributors as well as unfavorable weather patterns.

Consumer Products Net sales totaled 117.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up slightly from the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on marginally higher volume. 

Building Products Net sales totaled 139.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, down 26.2 million, or 15.8 , from the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to lower volume and an unfavorable shift in product mix, which more than offset contributions from the acquisition of Ragasco in June 2024. 

Other - Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 are related to our former Sustainable Energy Solutions operating segment, which was deconsolidated in May 2024 when we sold a 51 interest in the business. In periods subsequent to the sales transaction, our 49 interest is accounted for under the equity method.

Consumer Products Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was 17.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 3.5 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on improved gross margin driven by lower material costs. 

Building Products Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations decreased 20.0 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on lower volume, particularly in our heating and cooking products, and unfavorable mix combined with lower equity earnings at ClarkDietrich. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 included 1.9 million of incremental expense related to the Ragasco acquisition resulting primarily from the step up of inventory to fair value. 

Unallocated Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was down 1.0 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by higher SG A partially offset by lower losses due to the deconsolidation of our former Sustainable Energy Solutions operating segment in May 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we generated 41.1 million of cash from operating activities, invested 9.6 million in property, plant and equipment, spent 88.9 million to acquire Ragasco, and received 11.8 million for the sale of 51 of our former Sustainable Energy Solutions operating segment. Additionally, we paid 6.8 million to repurchase 150,000 common shares and paid dividends of 8.1 million on the common shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

Activity related to our discontinued operations has not been segregated in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note B Discontinued Operations for a summarization of significant non-cash items related to discontinued operations. 
 
 We believe we have access to adequate resources to meet the needs of our existing businesses for normal operating costs, mandatory capital expenditures, debt redemptions, dividend payments, and working capital, to the extent not funded by cash provided by operating activities, for at least 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. These resources include cash and cash equivalents and unused committed lines of credit under our Credit Facility, which had a total of 500.0 million of borrowing capacity available to be drawn as of August 31, 2024. 
 
 Although we do not currently anticipate a need, we believe that we could access the financial markets to sell long-term debt or equity securities. However, the continuation of uncertain economic conditions, including those caused by a high interest rate environment, could create volatility in the financial markets, which may impact our ability to access capital and the terms under which we can do so. 
 
 We routinely monitor current operational requirements, financial market conditions, and credit relationships and we may choose to seek additional capital by issuing new debt and/or equity securities to strengthen our liquidity or capital structure. Should we seek additional capital, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders and/or increase our interest costs. We may also from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open-market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our business is cyclical and cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to economic and industry conditions. We rely on cash and short-term borrowings to meet cyclical increases in working capital needs. These needs generally arise during periods of increased economic activity or increasing raw material prices, requiring higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable. During economic slowdowns or periods of decreasing raw material costs, working capital needs generally decrease as a result of the reduction of inventories and accounts receivable. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 41.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, down from 59.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower net earnings from core operations and a 25.7 million decrease in dividends from unconsolidated joint ventures.

Table of Contents 

Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used by investing activities was 88.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 44.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Net cash used by investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Ragasco and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sale of 51 of the nominal share capital of our former Sustainable Energy Solutions operating segment on May 29, 2024. 
 
 Investment activities are largely discretionary and future investment activities could be reduced significantly, or eliminated, as economic conditions warrant. We assess acquisition opportunities as they arise, and any such opportunities may require additional financing. However, there can be no assurance that any such opportunities will arise, that any such acquisition opportunities will be consummated, or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms if required. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used by financing activities was 18.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 269.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we paid 6.8 million to repurchase 150,000 common shares and paid dividends of 8.1 million on the common shares. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we paid dividends of 15.7 million on the common shares and repaid 243.8 million of long-term debt associated with the redemption of the 2026 Notes. 
 
 Common shares On September 24, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.17 per common share payable on December 27, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 13, 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we declared dividends totaling 0.32 per common share under our pre-Separation capital structure. 
 
 On March 20, 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 6,600,000 common shares. 
 
 On March 24, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 5,618,464 common shares, increasing the total number of common shares then authorized for repurchase to 10,000,000. As of August 31, 2024, 5,915,000 common shares remained available for repurchase under these two authorizations. 
 
 The common shares may be repurchased under these authorizations from time to time, with consideration given to the market price of the common shares, the nature of other investment opportunities, cash flows from operations, general economic conditions and other relevant considerations. Repurchases may be made on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. 
 
 Long-term debt and short-term borrowings As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our short-term and long-term debt agreements. Our debt agreements do not include credit rating triggers or material adverse change provisions. There were no outstanding borrowings drawn against the Credit Facility at August 31, 2024, leaving the full borrowing capacity of 500.0 million available for future use.

Table of Contents 

Dividend Policy 
 
 We currently have no material contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Board. The Board reviews the dividend quarterly and establishes the dividend rate based upon our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects, and other relevant factors. While we have paid a dividend every quarter since becoming a public company in 1968, there is no guarantee that payments of dividends will continue in the future. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to our valuation of receivables, inventories, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, income and other tax accruals, contingencies and litigation, and business combinations. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect our significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, our consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or to use different assumptions in the application of such policies. Our critical accounting policies have not significantly changed from those discussed in Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates of the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market risks have not materially changed from those disclosed in Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that Worthington Enterprises files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Worthington Enterprises principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management, under the supervision of and with the participation of Worthington Enterprises principal executive officer and principal financial officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q (the quarterly period ended August 31, 2024). Based on that evaluation, Worthington Enterprises principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were designed at the reasonable assurance level and were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes that occurred during the period covered by this Form 10-Q (the quarterly period ended August 31, 2024) in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Lega l Proceedings 
 We are involved in various judicial and administrative proceedings, as both plaintiff and defendant, arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that any such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operation or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 There are certain risks and uncertainties in our business that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. In PART I Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2024 Form 10-K, we included a detailed discussion of our risk factors. Our risk factors have not changed significantly from those disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K. Those risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and investments in the common shares and in connection with the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in the 2024 Form 10-K could materially affect our business, consolidated financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. The risk factors described in the 2024 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and/or future results. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equ ity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 
 There were no equity securities of Worthington Enterprises sold by Worthington Enterprises during the three months ended August 31, 2024 that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Common shares withheld to cover tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted common shares are treated as common share purchases for purposes of the following table. However, those withheld common shares are not considered common share repurchases under an authorized common share repurchase plan or program. The total number of common shares purchased, as indicated in the table below, include (1) common shares withheld from our employees to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of restricted common shares and (2) common shares repurchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs.

(1) The number shown represents, as of the end of each period, the maximum number of common shares that could be purchased under the publicly announced repurchase authorizations then in effect. On March 20, 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 6,600,000 common shares. On March 24, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 5,618,464 common shares, increasing the total number of common shares then authorized for repurchase to 10,000,000 (net of previously repurchased common shares). A total of 4,085,000 common shares have been repurchased since the latest authorization, leaving 5,915,000 common shares available for repurchase under these authorizations at August 31, 2024, and such authorizations are not subject to a fixed expiration date. The common shares available for repurchase under the authorizations currently in effect may be purchased from time to time, with consideration given to the market price of the common shares, the nature of other investment opportunities, cash flows from operations, general economic conditions and other relevant considerations. Repurchases may be made on the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions.
