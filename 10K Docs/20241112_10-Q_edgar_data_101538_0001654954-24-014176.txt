In October 2016, as a result of its audit, SAT assessed the Company million pesos, which was approximately in U.S. Dollars USD as of December 31, 2016. SAT s assessment was based on the disallowance of specific costs that the Company deducted on the 2013 USAMSA income tax return. The assessment was settled in 2018 with no assessment due from the Company. In 2019, the Company was notified that SAT re-opened its assessment of USAMSA s 2013 income tax return and, in November 2019, SAT assessed the Company million pesos, which was approximately USD as of December 31, 2019. Management reviewed the 2019 assessment notice from SAT and, similar to the earlier assessment, believed the findings have no merit. An appeal was filed by the Company in November 2019 suspending SAT from taking immediate action regarding the assessment. In August 2020, the Company filed a lawsuit against SAT for resolution of the process and, in December 2020, filed closing arguments. In 2022, the Mexican court ruled against the Company in the above matter, which was subsequently appealed by the Company. 23 Table of Contents UNITED STATES ANTIMONY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) September 30, 2024 million pesos, or approximately USD, which includes of unpaid income taxes and of interest and penalties. Management, along with its legal counsel, assessed the possible outcomes for this tax audit and believed, based on discussions with its attorneys located in Mexico, that the most likely outcome would be that the Company would be successful in its appeal resulting in no tax due. Management determined that no amount should be accrued at December 31, 2023 relating to this potential tax liability. In March 2024, Mexico s appellate court ruled in favor of the Company with no assessment due related to this audit of USAMSA s 2013 income tax return by SAT and instructed the lower court to issue a new ruling. In May 2024, Mexico s lower court issued a final ruling on this matter in favor of the Company but left open the possibility for the SAT to re-open their audit. Subsequent to this judgment, the Company requested a final ruling on whether SAT can re-open this matter, on which the appellate court has not ruled. These rulings support the Company s position on this tax matter and have had no impact on the Company s financial statements.

As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms we, us, our, United State Antimony Corporation, , US Antimony, USAC, and the Company , mean United States Antimony Corporation, unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts in this Quarterly Report are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Management s Discussion and Analysis is intended to be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the integral notes Notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. The following statements may be forward-looking in nature and actual results may differ materially. 26 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS History United States Antimony Corporation was incorporated in Montana in January 1970 to mine and produce antimony products. In December 1983, the Company suspended its antimony mining operations in the U.S. but continued to produce antimony products using foreign sources of antimony ore. In April 1998, the Company formed US Antimony de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. USAMSA to smelt antimony in Mexico, and, in August 2005, the Company formed Antimonio de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ADM to explore and develop antimony and precious metal deposits in Mexico. The Company formed Bear River Zeolite Company BRZ in 2000 for the purpose of mining and producing zeolite in Idaho. Our principal business is the production and sale of antimony, precious metals, and zeolite products. In May 2012, our shares of common stock started trading on the NYSE MKT (now NYSE AMERICAN) under the symbol UAMY. On March 11, 2024, the Company shut down the operations of USAMSA, which was part of the antimony segment, and announced its intent to sell its USAMSA subsidiary. See Note 1 and Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for further information. The accounting requirements for reporting USAMSA as a discontinued operation were met in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , and Management s Discussion Analysis and Plan of Operation reflect the results of USAMSA as a discontinued operation and are excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Although we extract minerals from the Bear River Zeolite property located in Idaho that we later process and sell, we have not yet prepared a technical report summary for the Bear River Zeolite property making a determination on the property s mineral resources or mineral reserves. However, the Company has completed test hole drilling and has retained a qualified third-party expert who is in the process of preparing a technical reserve report for the Bear River Zeolite property. We strive to achieve excellence in mine safety and health performance and work with government agencies to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and health and safety standards. The Company is organized and managed by the following four segments, which represent our operating units: United States antimony segment, Mexico antimony segment, zeolite segment, and precious metals segment. See Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for the Mexico discontinued operations that are excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. United States Antimony Segment Our United States antimony segment consists of an antimony plant in the Burns Mining District of Sanders County in Montana, which processes antimony ore primarily into antimony oxide, antimony metal, antimony trisulfide, and precious metals. Antimony oxide is a fine, white powder. Our antimony oxide is used in conjunction with a halogen to form a synergistic flame-retardant system for plastics, rubber, fiberglass, textile goods, paints, coatings, and paper. Our antimony oxide is also used as a color fastener in paint and as a phosphorescent agent in fluorescent light bulbs. Our antimony metal is used in bearings, storage batteries and ordnance. Our antimony trisulfide is used as a primer in ammunition. The precious metals processed at this plant in Montana are included in our precious metals segment. We closed our antimony mine and mill in Montana in December 1983 because antimony ore could be purchased more economically from foreign sources. Our mine and mill are less than one mile from our current antimony smelter plant in Montana. We hold one patented claim at this mine. We also own mining claims in Alaska and Ontario, Canada. However, currently, the Company has no active operations in Alaska or Ontario, Canada. As a result of the mine and mill closure in Montana, we have relied on sources outside the U.S. for antimony ore since 1983, and there are risks of interruption in procurement from these sources and volatile changes in world market prices for these materials that are not controllable by us. We anticipate continuing to receive antimony ore primarily from an existing supplier in Canada. In addition, we continue to actively research other domestic and non-domestic sources for antimony ore that are economically profitable. The acquisition of antimony ore is technically complex and a function of the country s laws and regulations. Our purchasing consequently requires flexibility regarding supply agreements, credit support, etc. and is tailored accordingly to specific suppliers. 27 Table of Contents We estimate (but have not independently confirmed) that our present share of the domestic and international markets for antimony oxide products is approximately 4 and less than 1 , respectively. We are the only significant U.S. producer of antimony products. We believe we are competitive both domestically and world-wide due to the following: We are the only U.S. domestic processor of antimony products. We can process ore quickly and have minimal shipping time to domestic customers. We have a reputation for quality products delivered on a timely basis. We have the only operating, permitted antimony smelter located in the U.S. Mexico Antimony Segment The Company has two subsidiaries in Mexico, USAMSA and ADM. On March 11, 2024, we shut down the operational activities of USAMSA, which primarily includes the following two antimony and precious metals processing plants in Mexico: (1) the Madero smelter in Coahuila, and (2) the Puerto Blanco flotation mill, oxide circuit, and cyanide leach circuit in Guanajuato. The Company intends to sell its USAMSA subsidiary over the next year and has initiated an active search for buyers of its operations and/or assets. See Note 1 and Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for further information. We will maintain our existing Los Juarez mining claims and concessions in Cadereyta de Montes Queretaro, Mexico, which are included in our ADM subsidiary. There are presently no active operations at Los Juarez. Zeolite Segment Our zeolite segment consists of a mine and processing plant located in Preston, Idaho, Bear River Zeolite, Inc. BRZ ), which produces zeolite. Our zeolite is used for various purposes including soil amendment and fertilizer, water filtration, sewage treatment, nuclear waste and other environmental cleanup, odor control, gas separation, animal nutrition, and other miscellaneous applications. BRZ has a lease with Zeolite, LLC that entitles BRZ to surface mine and process zeolite on property in Preston, Idaho, in exchange for a royalty payment. The annual royalty payment is the greater of: (1) the minimum annual royalty of 60,000, adjusted annually for the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or (2) 11.00 per ton for the first ten thousand tons, 9.90 per ton for tons in excess of ten thousand up to twenty thousand, and 8.80 per ton for tons in excess of twenty thousand. This Zeolite LLC lease also requires BRZ to pay 10,000 to the lessor on March 1 of each year during the term of the lease, which ends March 1, 2025. BRZ also pays two other royalties on the sale of zeolite products. On a combined basis, BRZ pays royalties ranging from 8 to 13 on the sale of zeolite products. In addition, BRZ can surface mine and process zeolite on property owned by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management that is located adjacent to the Company s Preston, Idaho property after obtaining required permits. 28 Table of Contents Zeolite refers to a group of industrial minerals that consist of hydrated aluminosilicates that hold cations such as calcium, sodium, ammonium, various heavy metals, and potassium in their crystal lattice. Water is loosely held in cavities in the lattice. BRZ zeolite is regarded as one of the best zeolites in the world due to its high cation exchange capacity (CEC) of approximately 180-220 meq/100 gr. (which predicts plant nutrient availability and retention in soil), its hardness and high clinoptilolite content (which is an effective barrier to prevent problematic radionuclide movement), its absence of clay minerals, and its low sodium content. Our zeolite has been used in: Soil Amendment and Fertilizer . Zeolite has been successfully used to fertilize golf courses, sports fields, parks and common areas, and high value agricultural crops. Water Filtration . Zeolite is used for particulate, heavy metal and ammonium removal in swimming pools, municipal water systems, industrial water discharge streams, fisheries, fish farms, and aquariums. Sewage Treatment . Zeolite is used in sewage treatment plants to remove nitrogen and as a carrier for microorganisms. Nuclear Waste and Other Environmental Cleanup . Zeolite has shown a strong ability to selectively remove strontium, cesium, radium, uranium, and various other radioactive isotopes from solution. Zeolite can also be used for the cleanup of soluble metals such as mercury, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, arsenic, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, antimony, calcium, silver and uranium. Odor Control . A major cause of odor around cattle, hog, and poultry feed lots is the generation of the ammonium in urea and manure. The ability of zeolite to absorb ammonium prevents the formation of ammonia gas, which disperses the odor. Gas Separation . Zeolite has been used for some time to separate gases, to re-oxygenate downstream water from sewage plants, smelters, pulp and paper plants, and fishponds and tanks, and to remove carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from methane generators as organic waste, sanitary landfills, municipal sewage systems, animal waste treatment facilities, and is excellent in pressure swing apparatuses. Animal Nutrition . According to third-party research, feeding up to 2 zeolite increases growth rates, decreases conversion rates, and prevents scours. Miscellaneous Uses . Other uses include catalysts, petroleum refining, concrete, solar energy and heat exchange, desiccants, pellet binding, horse and kitty litter, floor cleaner, traction control, ammonia removal from mining waste, and carriers for insecticides, pesticides and herbicides. Precious Metals Segment Our precious metals segment consists of a precious metals recovery plant that is operated in conjunction with the antimony processing plant in Montana. Precious metals are recovered in the leach circuit and settling pond after the ore goes through the crushing and flotation cycles. When precious metals are contained in antimony source, the metallurgical techniques employed for the recovery of antimony are altered to also recover the precious metals. The principal source of antimony concentrates bearing precious metals comes from our Canadian supplier, who also purchases these precious metals back from the Company. The sales of this product are intermittent throughout the year. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

A portion of this increased demand for antimony metal was related to the processing of customer-owned antimony ore. The sales price per pound related to the processing of customer-owned antimony ore was lower than the sales price per pound for our other antimony products, which was the primary reason for the decrease in our average sales price per pound during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased 1,210,979 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to improved cost efficiencies with higher volume and the prior year sale of purchased finished antimony trioxide at a lower gross margin. Also, the improved results related to average gross profit per pound in both nine-month periods presented were due to discontinuing our Mexico antimony operations, the results of which are not included in the continuing operations information presented in Management s Discussion and Analysis and Plan of Operation, but rather in discontinued operations, which is presented in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. 30 Table of Contents Zeolite Financial and operational performance of zeolite for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: For the three months ended Zeolite September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Revenue 682,947 671,825 11,122 1.7 Gross profit (loss) (208,392 (350,370 141,978 -40.5 Tons of zeolite sold 2,603 2,254 349 15.5 Average sales price per ton 262 298 (36 -12.0 Average cost per ton 342 454 (112 -24.5 Average gross profit (loss) per ton (80 (155 75 -48.5 Financial and operational performance of zeolite for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: For the nine months ended Zeolite September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Revenue 2,280,338 1,941,009 339,329 17.5 Gross profit (loss) (450,556) (195,464) (255,092) 130.5 Tons of zeolite sold 8,611 8,007 604 7.5 Average sales price per ton 265 242 23 9.2 Average cost per ton 317 267 50 18.9 Average gross profit (loss) per ton (52) (24) (28) 114.3 Zeolite revenue increased 339,329, or 17.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: The increased average sales price per ton, which was mainly related to a price increase that was effective towards the end of 2023, and The increased tons of zeolite sold, which was mainly related to increased demand and our ability to meet customer orders in a more timely fashion. Gross profit decreased by 255,092 for the nine months end September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased costs for maintenance, backup equipment leases, and related expenses in repairing older machinery and equipment, especially during production downtime.

We use this measure to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to analyze the factors and trends affecting our business. EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that the use of EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The increased vendor payables balance at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was mainly due to a vendor that had extensive deliveries later in the third quarter of 2024. Cash flow used by investing activities improved by 1,479,106 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to less fixed asset purchases and the sale of our personal residence. See Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for further information. 36 Table of Contents Cash flow used by financing activities improved by 786,640 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the payment of a dividend of 787,730 on January 25, 2023 to the holders of 1,692,672 shares of Series D Preferred stock. Our mission is to service our employees, customers, and vendors well and grow our business profitably both organically and through strategic acquisitions and partnerships to increase shareholder value. The Company is focused on generating positive cash flow to fund its mission. One method of improving positive cash flow has been through our review of each segment s operations and financial results to make informed decisions that benefit the Company overall. An example of the results of our review relates to USAMSA. Our USAMSA subsidiary has generated cumulative losses since inception. Therefore, we shut down the operations of USAMSA on March 11, 2024. Another method of generating cash is through the sale or issuance of common stock, warrants, debt, and other investment vehicles, which the Company has been successful at executing in the past. However, our ability to access capital or raise funds when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available when, and in the amounts and terms needed, or if capital is not available at all, the Company could be required to significantly curtail its operations, modify existing strategic plans, and/or dispose of certain operations or assets, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. The Company could also receive funds from the U.S. Government for initiatives related to antimony, zeolite, and other minerals. However, there is no assurance that U.S. Government funding will be able accessible to the Company. We may use cash to acquire businesses. The nature of these investments and transactions, however, makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 12,969,132. We intend to fund our cash requirements with our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our operations, and capital raised from various investment vehicles and believe cash from these sources are sufficient to cover our requirements for the next 12 months. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions of Management Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures At the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Co-Principal Executive Officers PEO and Principal Financial Officer PFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the PEO and the PFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms, and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s accounting staff. The small size of the Company s accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external accounting and legal professionals. The Company is reviewing various plans to strengthen its internal controls. These plans are ongoing and include: (i) reviewing various software packages to determine if it can reduce hours spent by personnel in the accounting department by automating manual processes, (ii) determining whether controls can be implemented to mitigate segregation of duties issues, (iii) hiring additional accountants to improve our segregation of duties controls, (iv) designing controls to formalize roles and responsibilities, and (v) designing certain entity-level controls to support the control environment. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. 37 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company might otherwise have. (b) The Sales Agent Indemnification .

Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 9 will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party or parties under this Section 9 , notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from (i) any liability that it might have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9 and (ii) any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provision of this Section 9 unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (2) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (3) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (4) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties. All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred. An indemnifying party will not, in any event, be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 9 (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding. 32 (d) Contribution . In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 9 is applicable in accordance with its terms but for any reason is held to be unavailable from the Company or the Sales Agent, the Company and the Sales Agent will contribute to the total losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company from persons other than the Sales Agent, such as persons who control the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company, who also may be liable for contribution) to which the Company and the Sales Agent may be subject in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Sales Agent on the other. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Sales Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total Net Proceeds from the sale of the Placement Shares received by the Company bear to the total compensation received by the Sales Agent from the sale of Placement Shares on behalf of the Company. If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Sales Agent, on the other, with respect to the statements or omission that resulted in such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations with respect to such offering. Such relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Sales Agent, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Sales Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 9(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, liability, expense, or damage, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include, for the purpose of this Section 9(d) , any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim to the extent consistent with Section 9(c) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(d) , the Sales Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions received by it under this Agreement and no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9(d) , any person who controls a party to this Agreement within the meaning of the Securities Act will have the same rights to contribution as that party (and any officers, directors, members, partners, employees or agents of the Sales Agent and each broker dealer affiliate of the Sales Agent will have the same rights to contribution as the Sales Agent), and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company will have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions hereof. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made under this Section 9(d) , will notify any such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify will not relieve that party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have under this Section 9(d) except to the extent that the failure to so notify such other party materially prejudiced the substantive rights or defenses of the party from whom contribution is sought. Except for a settlement entered into pursuant to the last sentence of Section 9(c) hereof, no party will be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent if such consent is required pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof. 33 10. Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery . The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section 9 of this Agreement and all representations and warranties of the Company herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall survive, as of their respective dates, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Sales Agent, any controlling person of the Sales Agent, or the Company (or any of their respective officers, directors, members or controlling persons), (ii) delivery and acceptance of the Placement Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement. 11.

(d) Unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section 11 , this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the issuance and sale of all of the Placement Shares to or through the Sales Agent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; provided that the provisions of Section 7(g) , Section 9 , Section 10 , Section 11(f) , Section 16 and Section 17 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination. (e) This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless terminated pursuant to Sections 11(a) , (b) , (c) or (d) above or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties; provided , however , that any such termination by mutual agreement shall in all cases be deemed to provide that Section 7(g) , Section 9 , Section 10 , Section 11(f) , Section 16 and Section 17 shall remain in full force and effect. (f) Any termination of this Agreement shall be effective on the date specified in such notice of termination; provided , however , that such termination shall not be effective until the close of business on the date of receipt of such notice by the Sales Agent or the Company, as the case may be.

 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
 
 uamy_ex41.htm EXHIBIT 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES The following description of capital stock summarizes certain provisions of our Third Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles of Incorporation and our First Restated By-Laws (the Bylaws ). The description is intended as a summary, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws. Authorized Capital Stock Our authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of Common stock and 10,0000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. There were 108,438,984 shares of common stock, 750,000 shares of Series B preferred stock and 177,904 shares of Series C preferred stock outstanding as of November 5, 2024. Provisions of Note in Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws Our Articles of Incorporation includes a forum selection provision designating the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) as the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company (b) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, or shareholder of the Company to the Company or the Company s shareholders (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Montana Business Corporation Act (the MBCA ), the Articles of Incorporation, or the Bylaws (as either may be amended or restated) or as to which the MBCA confers jurisdiction on the State of Montana District Court of Lake and Sanders Counties or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of this section is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Montana (a Foreign Action in the name of any shareholder, such shareholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Montana in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce this section (an Enforcement Action and (ii) having service of process made upon such shareholder in any such Enforcement Action by service upon such shareholder s counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such shareholder. This forum selection provision may limit investors ability to bring claims in judicial forums that they find favorable to such disputes and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. The Company has adopted this provision to limit the time and expense incurred by its management to challenge any such claims. As a company with a small management team, this provision allows its officers to not lose a significant amount of time travelling to any particular forum so they may continue to focus on operations of the Company. The following is a description of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and reflects the terms of the Company s authorized capital stock. Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of us. These provisions, which are summarized below, could discourage takeovers, coercive or otherwise. These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our Board of Directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us. Authorized but Unissued Capital Stock We have authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and common stock, and our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. These shares could be used by our Board of Directors to make it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Limits on Stockholders ability to Call a Special Meeting Our Bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or Secretary of the Company upon the written request of one or more persons that own shares representing at least 25 of the voting power of the stock entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting. This may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for holders controlling less than 25 of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors. Common Stock Voting Rights Each holder of the Company s Common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. Dividend Rights Holders of Common stock are entitled to receive dividends, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors payable from earnings and profits of the corporation, as detailed in the Company s Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws. The Company currently does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Liquidation Rights In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Common stock are entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all debts and other liabilities of the Company. Holders of our preferred stock are entitled to a liquidation preference that is senior to holders of the Common stock, and therefore would receive dividends and liquidation assets prior to the holders of the Common stock. Preferred Stock Subject to amounts of outstanding preferred stock, additional shares of our preferred stock may be divided into and issued in one or more additional series. Our board of directors is authorized to divide the authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock into one or more series, each of which shall be so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes. Our board of directors is authorized, within the limitations prescribed by law and our Articles of Incorporation, to fix and determine the designations, rights, qualifications, preferences, limitations and terms of the shares of any series of preferred stock. The following is a description of our outstanding series of preferred stock (there are no shares of Series A or Series D preferred stock outstanding): Series B Preferred Stock In 1993, the Board established a Series B preferred stock, consisting of 750,000 shares. The Series B preferred stock has preference over the Company s common stock and Series A preferred stock (none of which are outstanding); has no voting rights (absent default in payment of declared dividends); and is entitled to cumulative dividends of 0.01 per share per year, payable if and when declared by the Board of Directors. During each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized 7,500 in Series B preferred stock dividend. In the event of dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the preferential amount payable to Series B preferred stockholders is 1.00 per share plus dividends in arrears. No dividends have been declared or paid with respect to the Series B preferred stock. The Series B Preferred stock is no longer convertible to shares of the Company s common stock. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, cumulative dividends in arrears on the outstanding Series B shares were 217,500 and 210,000, respectively and the aggregate Series B liquidation preference at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 967,500 and 960,000, respectively. 2 Series C Preferred Stock In 2000, the Board established a Series C preferred stock. The Series C preferred stock has preference over the Company s common stock and has voting rights equal to that number of shares outstanding, but no conversion or dividend rights. In the event of dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the preferential amount payable to Series C preferred stockholders is 0.55 per share. We refer you to our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and the applicable statutes of the State of Montana for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. Warrants On July 23, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which we sold units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Such warrants were issued on July 27, 2020. Each warrant has an exercise price of 0.46 per share, is exercisable six months following issuance and has a term of five and one-half years following issuance. As of November 5, 2024, warrants to purchase 2,285,715 shares of common stock remain outstanding. On July 27, 2020, we issued warrants to purchase shares of common stock to Roth Capital Partners, LLC as partial compensation for services rendered in connection with the July 2020 unit offering. Each warrant has an exercise price of 0.46 per share, is exercisable six months following issuance and has a term of five and one-half years following issuance. As of November 5, 2024, warrants to purchase 804,000 shares of common stock remain outstanding. On February 1, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which we sold shares of common stock in a registered direct offering and unregistered warrants to purchase shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement. Such warrants were issued on February 3, 2021. Each warrant has an exercise price of 0.85 per share, is exercisable six months following issuance and has a term of five and one-half years following issuance.
