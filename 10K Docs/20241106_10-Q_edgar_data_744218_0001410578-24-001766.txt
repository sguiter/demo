 CELLDEX THERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2024 million. The Company has had recurring losses and incurred a loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million. The Company believes that the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. During the next twelve months and beyond, the Company may take further steps to raise additional capital to meet its long-term liquidity needs including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: the licensing of drug candidates with existing or new collaborative partners, possible business combinations, issuance of debt, or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and the Company s negotiating position in capital-raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used. There is also no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financings may be dilutive to the Company s stockholders; debt financings, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict the Company s ability to operate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce the Company s economic potential from products under development. The Company s ability to continue funding its planned operations beyond twelve months from the issuance date is also dependent on the timing and manner of payment of the future milestone under the Settlement Agreement (defined below) with Shareholder Representative Services LLC SRS (refer to Note 14), in the event that the Company achieves the milestone related to that payment. The Company, at its option, may decide to pay that milestone payment in cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof. If the Company is unable to raise the funds necessary to meet its long-term liquidity needs, it may have to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs, discontinue or delay ongoing or anticipated clinical trials, license out programs earlier than expected, raise funds at a significant discount or on other unfavorable terms, if at all, or sell all or a part of the Company.

 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The valuation technique used to measure fair value of the Company s Level 3 liabilities, which consist of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Kolltan in 2016, is primarily an income approach. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are estimates including probability of success, discount rates and amount of time until the conditions of the milestone payments are met. There was gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. The assumptions related to determining the fair value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration adjustment recorded in any given period.

 Restricted Stock shares of the Company s common stock plus contingent consideration in the form of development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones Kolltan Milestones of up to million payable in cash, in shares of Celldex s common stock or a combination of both, in the sole discretion of Celldex and subject to provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 1, 2016 (the Merger Agreement ). In October 2019, the Company received a letter from SRS, the hired representative of the former stockholders of Kolltan, notifying the Company that it objected to the Company s characterization of the development, regulatory approval and sales-based Kolltan Milestones relating to CDX-0158 as having been abandoned and contending instead that the related milestone payments are due from Celldex to the Kolltan stockholder. On August 18, 2020, Celldex filed a Verified Complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against SRS (acting in its capacity as the representative of the former stockholders of Kolltan pursuant to the Merger Agreement) seeking declaratory relief with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties relating to certain contingent milestone payments under the Merger Agreement relating to the discontinued CDX-0158 program (the Litigation ). On July 15, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive settlement agreement between the Company and SRS (the Settlement Agreement and the Company and SRS jointly filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with prejudice relating to the Litigation on July 19, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, all milestone payments provided for by the Merger Agreement were replaced in their entirety with the following payments, each of which is payable only once: (i) The Company paid million upon execution of the Settlement Agreement (the Initial Payment ). (ii) The Company paid million upon the Successful Completion (as defined in the Settlement Agreement) of a Phase 2 Clinical Trial (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of barzolvolimab. (iii) The Company shall pay million upon the first United States Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency, or, in each case, any successor organization, regulatory approval of a Surviving Company Product (as defined in the Settlement Agreement). The above payment obligations replace, in their entirety, the contingent consideration in the form of development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones of up to million contained in the Merger Agreement.

 our ability to raise sufficient capital to fund our preclinical and clinical studies and to meet our long-term liquidity needs, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise the funds necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we may have to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs, discontinue or delay ongoing or anticipated clinical trials, discontinue or delay our commercial manufacturing efforts, discontinue or delay our efforts to expand into additional indications for our drug product candidates, license out programs earlier than expected, raise funds at significant discount or on other unfavorable terms, if at all, or sell all or part of our business; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our ability to avoid intellectual property litigation, which can be costly and divert management time and attention; our ability to develop and commercialize products without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties; and the risk factors set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the factors listed under the headings Business, Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other reports that we file with the SEC .

We have no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We have expressed our expectations, beliefs and projections in good faith, and we believe they have a reasonable basis. However, we cannot assure you that our expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. OVERVIEW We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to exploring the science of mast cell biology and developing therapeutic antibodies which have the ability to engage the human immune system and/or directly affect critical pathways to improve the lives of patients with severe inflammatory, allergic, autoimmune and other devastating diseases. Our drug candidates include monoclonal and bispecific antibodies designed to address mast cell mediated diseases for which available treatments are inadequate. We are focusing our efforts and resources on the continued research and development of Barzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159), a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the KIT receptor and potently inhibits its activity, which is currently being studied across multiple mast cell driven diseases including 
 - Chronic Urticarias: We initiated Phase 3 studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in July 2024. In November 2023, we announced that our Phase 2 study in CSU achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (statistically significant mean change from baseline to week 12 of urticaria activity score compared to placebo) and was well tolerated. Patients on study continued to receive barzolvolimab and, in September 2024, we reported data from 52 weeks of treatment demonstrating sustained and deepening disease efficacy and a well tolerated long term safety profile. In July 2024, we announced that our Phase 2 study in chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, (statistically significant difference between the percent of patients with a negative provocation test compared to placebo at week 12) and was well tolerated. 12 week data from the CIndU study were presented in October of 2024 and all secondary endpoints across the study were also met and were highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Patients on study continue to receive barzolvolimab for 20 weeks of treatment; - Prurigo Nodularis (PN): In April 2024, we initiated a Phase 2 study in PN and enrollment is ongoing; positive data from a Phase 1b study in PN was reported in November 2023; 

 17 

Table of Contents 
 - Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE): A Phase 2 study in EoE was initiated in June 2023 and enrollment is ongoing; and - Atopic Dermatitis (AD): Atopic dermatitis has been selected as the next indication for the study of barzolvolimab. We are currently planning the design of a Phase 2 study in this indication, including in patients who received prior biologics, and plan to initiate this study by year end 2024. 
 Our next generation bispecific antibody platform to support pipeline expansion with additional candidates for inflammatory diseases. Targets are being selected based on new science as well as their compatibility to be used in bispecific antibody formats with our existing antibody programs. Development is focused on emerging, important pathways controlling inflammatory diseases. 
 More detail on these programs is provided in the Clinical Development Programs section. Our goal is to build a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. We believe our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product. The expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a drug candidate. It is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of drug candidates to each take five years or more, and total development costs could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars for each drug candidate. We estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines: 

Estimated Completion Clinical Phase Period Phase 1 1 - 2 Years Phase 2 1 - 5 Years Phase 3 1 - 5 Years The duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol, including, among others, the following: the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial; the duration of patient follow-up that seems appropriate in view of results; the number of clinical sites included in the trials; the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects; and the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate. We test potential drug candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and immunogenicity. We may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each drug candidate. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates. An element of our business strategy is to pursue the discovery, research and development of a broad portfolio of drug candidates. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of drug candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates increases. 

 18 

Table of Contents 
 Regulatory approval is required before we can market our drug candidates as therapeutic products. In order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval, the regulatory agencies must conclude that our clinical data demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials (through Phase 2) have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Furthermore, our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our drug candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. Our programs may also benefit from subsidies, grants, contracts or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, among others, it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. During the past five years through December 31, 2023, we incurred an aggregate of 338.8 million in research and development expenses. The following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs, license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program.

KIT is expressed in a variety of cells, including mast cells, and its activation by its ligand SCF regulates mast cell growth, differentiation, survival, chemotaxis and degranulation. Barzolvolimab is designed to block KIT activation by disrupting both SCF binding and KIT dimerization. By targeting KIT, barzolvolimab has been shown to inhibit mast cell activity and decrease mast cell numbers, which we believe could provide potential clinical benefit in mast cell related diseases.

 Barzolvolimab was initially studied in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), diseases where mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. In July 2024, we initiated two Phase 3 studies in CSU. Phase 1 studies in CSU and CIndU were successfully completed and Phase 2 studies are ongoing. In July 2023, we announced that enrollment was complete in the ongoing Phase 2 CSU study. In November 2023, we reported that barzolvolimab achieved the primary efficacy endpoint in this study, with a statistically significant mean change from baseline to week 12 of UAS7 (weekly urticaria activity score) compared to placebo and was well tolerated. In April 2024, we announced enrollment was complete in the ongoing Phase 2 CIndU study. In July 2024, we reported that barzolvolimab achieved the primary efficacy endpoint in this study with a statistically significant difference between the percent of patients with a negative provocation test compared to placebo at week 12 and was well tolerated. We plan to report topline 52 week data from the CSU study and full 12 week primary endpoint data from the CIndU study in the second half of 2024. Based on the positive results reported in urticaria, we expanded development of barzolvolimab into additional indications where mast cells are believed to play an important role. We are conducting an ongoing Phase 2 study in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and initiated a Phase 2 study in prurigo nodularis (PN) in April 2024 after reporting positive data from a Phase 1b study in PN in late 2023. We have selected atopic dermatitis as the next indication for the study of barzolvolimab and are currently planning the design of a Phase 2 study in this indication, including in patients who received prior biologics, and plan to initiate this study by year end 2024. We continue to assess potential opportunities for barzolvolimab in other diseases where mast cells play an important role, such as dermatologic, respiratory, allergic, gastrointestinal and ophthalmic conditions. Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) CSU presents as itchy hives, angioedema or both for at least six weeks without a specific trigger; multiple episodes can play out over years or even decades. It is one of the most frequent dermatologic diseases with a prevalence of 0.5-1.0 of the total population or up to approximately 1 to 3 million patients in the United States (Weller et al. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet.Org). Approximately 50 of patients with CSU achieve symptomatic control with antihistamines. Omalizumab, an IgE inhibitor, provides relief for roughly half of the remaining antihistamine refractory patients. Consequently, there is a need for additional therapies. We have completed a Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study of barzolvolimab in CSU. The study was designed to assess the safety of multiple ascending doses of barzolvolimab in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with antihistamines. Secondary and exploratory objectives included pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, clinical activity outcomes and quality of life assessments. Barzolvolimab was administered intravenously as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines, either alone or in combination with H2-antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor agonists. 45 patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines were enrolled and treated [35 barzolvolimab (n=9 in 0.5 mg/kg; n=8 in 1.5 mg/kg; n=9 in 3.0 mg/kg; n=9 in 4.5 mg/kg) and 10 placebo]. At saturating doses (1.5 mg/kg and higher), barzolvolimab resulted in rapid, marked and durable responses in patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines. The 1.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 4.5 mg/kg dose groups showed similar markedly improved urticaria symptoms, including rapid onset of responses (as early as 1 week after the first dose) and prolonged disease control with sustained durability up to 24 weeks. Patients with prior omalizumab therapy also had similar symptom improvement as all patients. Mean reduction from baseline in weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) at week 12 was 67 in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group (n=8), 67 in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group (n=9) and 82 in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group (n=9). Mean reduction from baseline in UAS7 at week 24 was 80 in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group (n=7), 70 in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group (n=6) and 77 in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group (n=7). Complete response (UAS7=0) at week 12 was 57 in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group, 44 in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group and 67 in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group. Complete response (UAS7=0) at week 24 was 57 in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group, 67 in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group and 43 in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group. Well-controlled disease (UCT 12) at week 12 was 75 in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group, 63 in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group and 89 in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group. Well-controlled disease (UCT 12) at week 24 was 75 in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group, 67 in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group and 67 in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group.

 During post-treatment follow up, 71 (10 of 14) of patients who had been treated with doses greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/kg and had a complete response (UAS7=0) at week 12, remained urticaria free at week 24 (patients received last dose of barzolvolimab at week 8). Profound and durable improvement in angioedema symptoms as measured through the weekly angioedema activity score (AAS7) was achieved across all dose levels evaluated with sustained activity observed with the 1.5 mg/kg and greater dose levels. Patients also reported improvements in quality of life outcomes as assessed by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) which surveys patients perceptions of symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school performance, personal relationships and treatment. 
 Tryptase suppression, indicative of mast cell depletion, paralleled symptom improvement, demonstrating the impact of mast cell depletion on CSU disease activity. Barzolvolimab was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and resolved while on study. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were hair color changes, COVID-19, headache, neutropenia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs and COVID-19 were reported as unrelated to treatment. Generally transient, asymptomatic and mild changes in hematologic parameters were observed, consistent with observations from prior studies. No pattern of further decrease was observed with multiple dose administration. Data from this study were reported across multiple medical meetings, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting in February 2023, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress in June 2023 and the European Academy of Dermatology Venereology (EADV) Congress in October 2023. In June 2022, we initiated dosing in a Phase 2 study in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy; in July 2023, we announced that enrollment was complete. The study is being conducted at approximately 75 sites across 9 countries. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of barzolvolimab to determine the optimal dosing strategy. 208 patients have been randomly assigned on a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 75 mg every 4 weeks, 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo during a 16-week placebo-controlled treatment phase. After 16 weeks, patients then enter a 36-week active treatment period, in which patients receiving placebo or the 75 mg dose are randomized to receive barzolvolimab 150 mg every 4 weeks or 300 mg every 8 weeks; patients already randomized to the 150 mg and 300 mg treatment arms remain on the same regimen as during the placebo-controlled treatment period. After 52 weeks, patients then enter a follow-up period for an additional 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is mean change in baseline to week 12 in UAS7 (weekly urticaria activity score). Secondary endpoints include safety and other assessments of clinical activity including ISS7 (weekly itch severity score), HSS7 (weekly hive severity score) and AAS7 (weekly angioedema activity score).

 Topline data from this study were presented in November of 2023 and 12 week treatment results were presented at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting in February 2024. Data from the 208 patients randomized in the study showed that barzolvolimab achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, with a statistically significant mean change from baseline to week 12 in UAS7 compared to placebo at all dose levels. Secondary and exploratory endpoints in the study were also achieved at week 12 and strongly support the primary endpoint results, including changes in ISS7 and HSS7 and responder analyses. Importantly, barzolvolimab demonstrated rapid, durable and clinically meaningful responses in patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines, including patients with prior omalizumab treatment. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups. The majority of patients on study had severe disease (UAS7 28).

Barzolvolimab demonstrated strong improvement in UAS7 independent of omalizumab status at week 12. Approximately 20 (n=41) of enrolled patients received prior treatment with omalizumab and more than half of these patients had omalizumab-refractory disease. These patients experienced a similar clinical benefit as the overall treated population within their individual dosing groups consistent with the barzolvolimab mechanism of action. Barzolvolimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity; through 12 weeks, the most common treatment emergent adverse events in barzolvolimab treated patients were urticaria/CSU (10 ), hair color changes (9 ), and neutropenia/ANC decrease (8 ). The rate of infections was similar between barzolvolimab treated patients and placebo with no association between neutropenia and infections.

 In June 2024, data on a secondary endpoint from the study, angioedema activity, and additional measures of angioedema control, were presented at the EAACI 2024 Congress. Approximately 72 of patients on study had angioedema at baseline. Barzolvolimab demonstrated significant improvements in AAS7 in patients with angioedema across all doses at week 12. This improvement was rapid (within 2 weeks) and durable (continued through 12 weeks). Barzolvolimab demonstrated strong improvement in AAS7 independent of omalizumab status at Week 12. Patients on barzolvolimab experienced a > 8 point improvement in AAS7 (considered a clinically meaningful result) across all doses compared to placebo (p Patients on study continued to receive barzolvolimab for up to 52 weeks and these long term treatment data were presented in September at the European Academy of Dermatology Venereology (EADV) Congress 2024. The data demonstrated a sustained and deepening disease efficacy and a well tolerated safety profile over a 52 week treatment period. Key highlighted included: Improvements in UAS7 (weekly urticaria activity score), previously shown to be statistically significantly vs placebo at Week 12, were noted as early as week 1 and were sustained or deepened at Week 52. At Week 16, patients receiving low dose barzolvolimab (75 mg) or placebo were transitioned to barzolvolimab 150 mg or 300 mg; after crossover, these patients experienced similar clinically meaningful disease response as the rest of the study population. 71 of patients treated with barzolvolimab 150 mg Q4W and 52 of patients treated with 300 mg Q8W had a complete response (no itch/hives; UAS7=0) at Week 52. These responses were observed early and sustained through 52 weeks. 74 of patients treated with barzolvolimab 150 mg Q4W and 68 of patients treated with 300 mg Q8W had well controlled (UAS7 We believe these results strongly support the further development of barzolvolimab in CSU. In July 2024, we initiated two Phase 3 studies of barzolvolimab in CSU. The studies, EMBARQ-CSU1 and EMBARQ-CSU2, are designed to establish the efficacy and safety of barzolvolimab in adult patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment. Both Phase 3 trials are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, global studies approximately 40 countries; 250 sites per study) where approximately 915 patients per trial will be randomized evenly to barzolvolimab 150 mg every 4 weeks (following 300 mg loading dose), barzolvolimab 300 mg every 8 weeks (following 450 mg loading dose) or placebo for 52 weeks. At 24 weeks, patients on placebo will be re-randomized to active treatment across both dosing groups. The primary endpoint of the studies will evaluate the clinical effect of barzolvolimab in reducing urticaria activity (weekly urticaria activity score; UAS7) at week 12. The studies are designed to detect a clinically meaningful difference between each of the active arms versus placebo in the overall population as well as in the subpopulation of omalizumab refractory participants. Enrollment is ongoing. Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU) CIndUs are forms of urticaria that have an attributable cause or trigger associated with them, typically resulting in hives or wheals. The prevalence of CIndU is estimated at 0.5 of the total population and is reported to overlap in up to 36 of CSU patients (Weller et al. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet.Org). There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible urticarias other than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers. We are currently exploring cold-induced and dermographism (scratch-induced) urticarias in an ongoing Phase 2 study.

 We completed a Phase 1b open label clinical trial in patients with CIndU refractory to antihistamines, conducted in Germany. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of a single intravenous dose (3 mg/kg) of barzolvolimab in patients with cold urticaria (ColdU) or symptomatic dermographism (SD). The study was expanded to include a cohort (single dose, 3 mg/kg) in patients with cholinergic urticaria CholU and a cohort at a lower dose (single dose, 1.5 mg/kg) in ColdU. Patient s symptoms were induced via provocation testing that resembles real life triggering situations. Secondary and exploratory objectives included pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including changes from baseline provocation thresholds, measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels, clinical activity outcomes, quality of life assessments and measurement of tissue mast cells through skin biopsies. Generally patients on study had high disease activity at baseline that was poorly controlled and marked impairment in quality of life. At 3 mg/kg in the ColdU and SD cohorts, safety results were reported for 21 patients and activity results were reported for the 20 patients who received a full dose of barzolvolimab. At 1.5 mg/kg in the ColdU cohort, safety results were reported for 10 patients and activity results were reported for the 9 patients who received a full dose of barzolvolimab. At 3 mg/kg in the cholinergic cohort, safety results were reported for 21 patients and activity results were reported for the 20 patients who received a full dose of barzolvolimab. Rapid (as early as 1 week) and durable responses were observed in patients as assessed by provocation testing. A complete response was achieved in 95 (n=19/20) of patients with ColdU and SD treated with a single dose at 3 mg/kg (n=10/10 ColdU; n=9/10 SD), including 3 patients who experienced insufficient response to prior omalizumab treatment. The median duration (range) of complete response through the 12-week observation period was 77+ days (29 86; n=10) for patients with ColdU and 57+ days (16 70; n=9) for patients with SD. A UCT score of 12 (well controlled) was achieved by 80 (n=16/20) of the patients within week 4 post-treatment. By week 8, all patients (100 ; n=20/20) achieved well-controlled urticaria, which was sustained to week 12 post-dose by 80 (n=16/20) of patients. Complete urticaria control (UCT=16) was achieved by 35 (n=7/20), 65 (n=13/20), and 40 (n=8/20) at weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively. A complete response was achieved in 100 (n=9 of 9) patients with ColdU treated with a single dose at 1.5 mg/kg, including 4 patients with disease refractory to omalizumab. The median duration of complete response through the 12-week observation period was 51+ days (7+ weeks). Following barzolvolimab administration, all patients achieved well controlled disease (UCT>12) with 7 of 9 achieving complete control (UCT=16). A complete response was achieved in 56 (n=5 of 9) patients with cholinergic urticaria treated with a single dose at 3 mg/kg. Most responses remained durable through to week 12. 63 (5/8) patients reported well controlled disease (UCT 12) at week 8 and 50 (4/8) at week 12, respectively. Patients also reported improvements in quality of life outcomes as assessed by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) which surveys patients perceptions of symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school performance, personal relationships and treatment. A single dose of barzolvolimab led to marked decreases in tryptase and in skin mast cells. The kinetics correlated with improvements in provocation testing and clinical activity, consistent with a central role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of ColdU and SD. This confirmed that serum tryptase level is a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker for assessing mast cell burden and clinical activity in inducible urticaria and potentially in other diseases with mast cell driven involvement. Barzolvolimab was well tolerated across all cohorts. In the 3 mg/kg ColdU and SD cohorts, most adverse events were mild, and the most common 3 patients) were hair color changes (76 ; n=16/21), infusion reactions (43 ; n=9/21), taste changes (38 ; n=8/21), nasopharyngitis (24 ; n=5/21), malaise (24 ; n=5/21), and headache (19 ; n=4/21). Hair color changes (generally small areas of hair color lightening) and taste disorders (generally partial changes of ability to taste salt or umami) are consistent with inhibiting KIT signaling in other cell types and completely resolved over time during follow-up. One patient with a history of fainting experienced loss of consciousness during infusion. The patient rapidly recovered. Importantly, no evidence of mast cell activation as measured by serum tryptase monitoring was observed in this patient. Barzolvolimab was also generally well tolerated by patients in the 1.5 mg/kg ColdU cohort and the 3.0 mg/kg cholinergic cohort with a similar safety profile to that reported previously. Across the Phase 1b inducible urticaria study, mean hematology parameters generally remained within the normal ranges an important finding for a KIT inhibitor. Mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in hemoglobin and white blood cell parameters occurred for some patients.

 Long term follow up data was collected from the 3.0 mg/kg cohorts in cold urticaria and symptomatic dermographism. 14 patients consented to the optional evaluation (6 cold, 8 symptomatic dermographism); 10 of the 14 still had complete control of their disease as assessed by provocation testing at week 12. Data were collected at one or more timepoints beyond week 12 through week 36. Most patients had return of symptoms and/or loss of urticaria control between 12 and 36 weeks. Remarkably, two patients remained provocation negative at 36 weeks, and four had well controlled disease (UCT 12) 36 weeks post dosing. Serum tryptase exhibits a similar rate of recovery as clinical symptoms, while skin mast cells return at a slower rate. Tissue KIT signaling, as approximated by SCF levels, was rapidly inhibited after dose administration and fully reactivated approximately 18 weeks after dosing. Tryptase levels return to pretreatment levels during follow up, while mast cells continue to recover. Drug related adverse events noted during the study all resolved. 
 Data from this study were reported in Allergy (Nov 2022) and across multiple medical meetings, including the GA LEN Global Urticaria Forum (GUF) in December and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress in June 2022. In July 2022, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 2 study in patients with CIndU who remain symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy; in April 2024, we announced that enrollment was complete. The study is being conducted at approximately 85 sites across approximately 12 countries. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of barzolvolimab in patients with CIndU to determine the optimal dosing strategy. 196 patients in 2 cohorts (differentiated by CIndU subtype) including 97 patients with cold urticaria and 99 patients with symptomatic dermographism were randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo during a 20-week treatment phase. Patients then enter a follow-up phase for an additional 24 weeks. In addition, the study includes the option for patients who have symptoms following the treatment phase, including patients who were on placebo, to enroll in an open label extension where all patients receive 300 mg of barzolvolimab every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of patients with a negative provocation test at week 12. Secondary endpoints include safety and other assessments of clinical activity including CTT (Critical Temperature Threshold), CFT (Critical Friction Threshold) and WI-NRS (Worst itch numeric rating scale).

 Topline primary endpoint data from this study were reported in July 2024 and 12 week treatment results were presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting. Data from the 193 patients randomized and treated in the study showed that barzolvolimab achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, a statistically significant difference between the percent of patients with a negative provocation test compared to placebo at week 12 as assessed by the TempTest in ColdU and the FricTest in SD. Secondary and exploratory endpoints in the study were also achieved at week 12 and strongly support the primary endpoint results, including responder analyses, improvements in Critical Temperature and Critical Friction Thresholds (CFT and CFT), changes in WI-NRSprovo (itch associated with provocation test) and Urticaria Control Test. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups. In cold urticaria, patients presented with a mean baseline critical temperature threshold of approximately 19 C or 66 F on the TempTest on initial provocation testing. In patients with symptomatic dermographism baseline FricTest thresholds were an average of 3.6 out of 4 pins. UCT scores at baseline reflect poorly controlled disease.

 Patients experienced rapid disease improvement as early as two weeks (the first assessment) after receiving the initial dose of barzolvolimab as demonstrated by reductions in critical temperature and friction thresholds resulting in hives and rapid reduction in itch at the time of provocation testing (WI-NRSprovo). Barzolvolimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile consistent with prior studies. Most adverse events were grade 1 (mild). Through 12 weeks, the most common treatment emergent adverse events in barzolvolimab treated patients were hair color changes (13 ; Grade 1, n=15 / Grade 2, n=2) and neutropenia (10 ; Grade 1, n=7 / Grade 2, n=6), which are mechanism related (KIT) and expected to be reversible. The rate of infections was similar between barzolvolimab-treated patients and placebo with no association between neutropenia and infections. We believe these results strongly support the further development of barzolvolimab in CIndU and plan to advance CIndU into Phase 3 registrational development.

 Prurigo Nodularis (PN) We have expanded clinical development of barzolvolimab into prurigo nodularis (PN). PN is a chronic skin disease characterized by the development of hard, intensely itchy (pruritic) nodules on the skin. Mast cells through their interactions with sensory neurons and other immune cells are believed to play an important role in amplifying chronic itch and neuroinflammation, both of which are a hallmark of PN. There is currently only one FDA approved therapy for PN, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry sources estimate there are approximately 154,000 patients in the United States with PN who have undergone treatment within the last 12 months and, of these, approximately 75,000 would be biologic-eligible. We have completed a Phase 1b multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intravenous study in PN. Data from the study, including 24 weeks of follow-up, were presented at the 12th World Congress on Itch (WCI) held in November 2023. 24 adults (evaluable: n=23 safety; n=22 efficacy) with moderate to severe PN were randomized across three arms: (1) barzolvolimab 3.0 mg/kg (n=9), barzolvolimab 1.5 mg/kg (n=7) and placebo (n=8). The primary endpoint of the study was safety; key secondary endpoints include changes from baseline in Worst Itch-Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS) Investigator Global Assessment (IGA). The primary timepoint for evaluation of clinical activity was 8 weeks; patients were followed for safety and efficacy endpoints to 24 weeks. Patients on study generally had moderate to severe disease with mean baselines scores across all arms of 8.6 for WI-NRS and 3.3 for IGA. A single IV dose of 3.0 mg/kg barzolvolimab resulted in rapid and durable reductions in itch and healing of skin lesions in patients with moderate to severe PN and that barzolvolimab was generally well tolerated. At week 8, the percentage of patients with 4-point decrease in WI-NRS was 57 and 43 for the single dose 3.0 or 1.5 mg/kg barzolvolimab arms, respectively, and 25 for the placebo arm; this level of response generally persisted out to week 16. In the 3.0 mg/kg arm, a 4-point decrease in WI-NRS reduction was seen as early as the first week and reached a high of 71 of patients at week six which was distinct from both the 1.5 mg/kg barzolvolimab and placebo arms.

This effect was noted as early as week 2 (the first clinic visit) and was maintained out to week 12/16. No patients treated at 1.5 mg/kg barzolvolimab or placebo achieved clear or almost clear skin according to IGA through week 8. 2 additional patients in the 1.5 mg/kg arm, 2 additional patients in the 3.0 mg/kg arm and 1 patient on placebo had IGA 0/1 at timepoints between weeks 8 and 24.

At the 3.0 mg/kg dose, tryptase was profoundly reduced to, or below, the level of quantification and this level of reduction was maintained at least through 8 weeks. Tryptase reduction was observed in the 1.5 mg/kg arm but to a lesser extent. Adverse Events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and considered unrelated to treatment. During the initial 8 week observation period in the 3.0 mg/kg dosing arm, an anaphylactic reaction occurred in a complicated patient with multiple comorbidities; the event fully resolved without sequelae. Generally, adverse events seen during the 24-week follow-up period were consistent with comorbidities commonly observed in the PN population.

 In April 2024, we initiated a Phase 2 subcutaneous study in PN. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of 2 dose levels of barzolvolimab compared to placebo in approximately 120 patients with moderate to severe PN who had inadequate response to prescription topical medications, or for whom topical medications are medically inadvisable (such as concerns for safety). Patients are randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 ratio to receive barzolvolimab injections of 150 mg Q4W after an initial loading dose of 450 mg, 300 mg Q4W after an initial loading dose of 450 mg, or placebo during a 24 week Treatment Phase. Participants then enter a follow-up phase with no study treatment for an additional 16 weeks through week 40. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effect of barzolvolimab, compared to placebo, on itch response as measured by the proportion of participants with 4-point improvement in the worst intensity itch per a numeric rating scale (WI-NRS). Secondary objectives include but are not limited to additional measures of itch response from baseline compared to different timepoints, the assessment of skin lesions as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), QoL outcomes and safety. The study will include approximately 50 clinical trial centers worldwide, including the United States. Enrollment is ongoing. Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) In July of 2023, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 2 study of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). EoE, the most common type of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils. This chronic inflammation can result in trouble swallowing, chest pain, vomiting and impaction of food in the esophagus, a medical emergency. Several studies have suggested that mast cells may be an important driver in the disease, demonstrating that the number and activation state of mast cells are greatly increased in EoE biopsies and that mast cell signatures correlate with markers of inflammation, fibrosis, pain and disease severity. Currently, there is only one FDA approved therapy for EoE, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry sources estimate there are approximately 160,000 patients in the United States with EoE who have undergone treatment within the last 12 months and, of these, approximately 48,000 would be biologic-eligible. Given the lack of effective therapies for EoE and barzolvolimab s potential as a mast cell depleting agent, we believe EoE is an important indication for future study. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of subcutaneous barzolvolimab in patients with active EoE. To optimize potential efficacy signal in this difficult to treat indication, we have recently amended the protocol to dose 300 mg every 4 weeks rather than 8 weeks. Approximately 75 patients will be enrolled in total. In the revised protocol, patients will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 300 mg every 4 weeks or placebo during a 16-week placebo-controlled treatment phase. Patients then enter a 12-week active treatment phase, in which all patients will receive barzolvolimab 300 mg every 4 weeks. Patients then enter a follow-up phase for an additional 16 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is reducing esophageal intraepithelial infiltration of mast cells as assessed by peak esophageal intraepithelial mast cell count. Secondary endpoints include the reduction of symptoms of dysphagia and esophageal intraepithelial infiltration of eosinophils and safety. The study includes approximately 60 clinical trial centers across 8 countries, including the United States. Enrollment is ongoing. Additional Barzolvolimab Development Activities In 2023, we completed the transfer of our current barzolvolimab manufacturing process to a CMO and successfully scaled up the drug substance manufacturing process to produce larger cGMP batches in support of late-stage trials and to prepare for potential commercialization. Drug product manufacturing into 1 mL pre-filled syringes has been completed and are actively being used in the ongoing Phase 3 CSU trials. In February 2022, we reported interim data after completing the in-life dosing portion of our six-month chronic toxicology study in non-human primates. The only clinically adverse finding at the completion of dosing was a profound impact on spermatogenesis, an expected and well understood effect of KIT inhibition. As a standard part of toxicology studies, some animals from each group continued to be observed through a recovery period to understand the reversibility of any adverse findings. Due to the very high concentrations of barzolvolimab at the end of dosing, the recovery period was approximately one year. As we expected, and consistent with previous findings with KIT blocking antibodies, we were pleased to report in December 2022, that during this recovery period spermatogenesis fully recovered in all male animals as measured by both sperm count and motility. The final histologic analysis and study report were completed in early 2023 and were consistent with previously reported results. We are encouraged with these findings and believe these data strongly support continued development of barzolvolimab.

 Bispecific Platform Our next generation bispecific antibody platform is supporting the expansion of our pipeline with additional candidates for inflammatory diseases. Targets are being selected based on new science as well as their compatibility to be used in bispecific antibody formats with our existing antibody programs. Development is focused on emerging, important pathways controlling inflammatory diseases. CDX-622 CDX-622 is a bispecific antibody that targets two complementary pathways that drive chronic inflammation, potently neutralizing the alarmin thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and depleting mast cells via stem cell factor (SCF) starvation. TSLP has been directly implicated in several respiratory and dermatological disorders, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic dermatitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria, and in fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In these disorders, TSLP is often upregulated and associated with disease severity. Similarly, mast cells drive or contribute to the pathophysiology of allergic, inflammatory, autoimmune and fibrotic disorders and CDX-622 contains a unique SCF neutralizing function that is expected to inhibit and deplete mast cells. Combined neutralization of SCF and TSLP with CDX-622 is expected to simultaneously reduce tissue mast cells and inhibit Type 2 inflammatory responses to potentially offer enhanced therapeutic benefit in inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. In preclinical studies, CDX-622 inhibits TSLP and SCF with similar potency to both its respective parental mAbs and comparator mAbs in vitro . CDX-622 was well tolerated in a multi-dose 8 week toxicology study in non-human primates. The No Adverse Event Level (NOAEL) was established to be 75 mg/kg, the highest dose level tested. We have completed manufacturing and IND-enabling activities and plan to initiate a Phase 1 study of CDX-622 in healthy volunteers by the end of 2024. CDX-585 CDX-585 combines our proprietary highly active PD-1 blockade and anti-ILT4 blockade to overcome immunosuppressive signals in T cells and myeloid cells, respectively. The concept behind CDX-585 is to simultaneously inhibit both T cell and myeloid suppressive signals to potentiate the anti-tumor activity of both cell types, and potentially overcome PD-1 resistance. We began dosing patients in May 2023 in a Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, multi-dose study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have progressed during or after standard of care therapy. The dose-escalation phase of the study has been completed and we have decided not to advance CDX-585 given our expanding clinical development program in the inflammatory space, including barzolvolimab, which will enter studies in its fifth indication by year end 2024 and the near term advancement of CDX-622 into the clinic. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES See Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding newly adopted and recent accounting pronouncements. See also Note 2 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no material changes to such critical accounting policies or estimates. We believe our most critical accounting policies include accounting for contingent consideration, revenue recognition, intangible and long-lived assets, research and development expenses and stock-based compensation expense.

Revenue Revenue from product development and licensing agreements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.7 million increase in contracts and grants revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our contract manufacturing and research and development agreements with Rockefeller University. We expect revenue to decrease over the next twelve months primarily due to a decrease in services expected to be performed under our contract manufacturing and research and development agreements with Rockefeller University. Research and Development Expense Research and development expenses consist primarily of (i) personnel expenses, (ii) laboratory supply expenses relating to the development of our technology, (iii) facility expenses and (iv) product development expenses associated with our drug candidates as follows: 

Three Months Ended Increase/ September 30, (Decrease) 2024 2023 (In thousands) Personnel 13,855 10,532 3,323 32 Laboratory supplies 1,074 1,249 (175) (14) Facility 1,263 1,282 (19) (1) Product development 26,539 19,457 7,082 36 Personnel expenses primarily include salary, benefits, stock-based compensation and payroll taxes. The 3.3 million increase in personnel expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense and an increase in employee headcount. We expect personnel expenses to increase over the next twelve months as a result of additional headcount to support the expanded development of barzolvolimab.

 Laboratory supplies expenses include laboratory materials and supplies, services, and other related expenses incurred in the development of our technology. Laboratory supply expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were relatively consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect laboratory supplies expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis. Facility expenses include depreciation, amortization, utilities, rent, maintenance and other related expenses incurred at our facilities. Facility expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were relatively consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect facility expenses to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis. Product development expenses include clinical investigator site fees, external trial monitoring costs, data accumulation costs, contracted research and outside clinical drug product manufacturing. The 7.1 million increase in product development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in barzolvolimab clinical trial expenses, partially offset by a decrease in barzolvolimab contract manufacturing expenses. We expect product development expenses to increase over the next twelve months as a result of the expanded development of barzolvolimab, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis. General and Administrative Expense The 1.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation and barzolvolimab commercial planning expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase over the next twelve months as a result of the expanded development of barzolvolimab and an increase in commercial planning efforts, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis. Investment and Other Income, Net The 7.0 million increase in investment and other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher levels of cash as a result of our November 2023 and March 2024 underwritten public offerings. We expect investment and other income to remain relatively consistent over the next twelve months, although there may be fluctuations on a quarterly basis. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist primarily of investments in money market mutual funds with commercial banks and financial institutions. We maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. We invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities, including municipal bond securities, U.S. government agency securities and high-grade corporate bonds that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity. The use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees; facility and facility-related costs for our offices, laboratories and manufacturing facility; fees paid in connection with preclinical studies, clinical studies, contract manufacturing, laboratory supplies and services; and consulting, legal and other professional fees. We anticipate that our cash flows from operations will continue to be focused in these areas as we progress our current drug candidates through the clinical trial process and develop additional drug candidates. To date, the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from our collaborative partners and from government entities and payments received for contract manufacturing and research and development services provided by us. The timing of any new contract manufacturing and research and development agreements, collaboration agreements, government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements, contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. At September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 756.0 million. We have had recurring losses and incurred a loss of 110.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 125.3 million. We believe that the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 are sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund current planned operations through 2027. This could be impacted if we elect to pay the future milestone under the Settlement Agreement with SRS in cash, in the event that we achieve the milestone related to that payment. During the next twelve months, we may take further steps to raise additional capital to meet our long-term liquidity needs including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: the licensing of drug candidates with existing or new collaborative partners, possible business combinations, issuance of debt, or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings. Although we have been successful in raising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used. There is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders; debt financings, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development. Our ability to continue funding our planned operations into and beyond twelve months from the issuance date is also dependent on the timing and manner of payment of the future milestone under the Settlement Agreement with SRS, in the event that we achieve the milestone related to that payment. We may decide to pay that milestone payment in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof. If we are unable to raise the funds necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we may have to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs, discontinue or delay ongoing or anticipated clinical trials, license out programs earlier than expected, raise funds at a significant discount or on other unfavorable terms, if at all, or sell all or a part of our business. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 125.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 74.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses and an increase in advance payments to clinical research and contract manufacturing organizations, partially offset by an increase in investment income as a result of higher levels of cash. We expect that cash used in operating activities will increase over the next twelve months as a result of the expanded development of barzolvolimab.

 We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development, including preclinical and clinical trials and clinical drug product manufacturing as our drug candidates are developed. We plan to spend significant amounts to progress our current drug candidates through the clinical trial process as well as to develop additional drug candidates. As our drug candidates progress through the clinical trial process, we may be obligated to make significant milestone payments, pursuant to our existing arrangements and arrangements we may enter in the future. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 314.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 65.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities of 313.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net sales and maturities of marketable securities of 66.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 441.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from stock issuances. In March 2024, we issued 9,798,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering, resulting in net proceeds of 432.3 million, after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations, including our research and development activities. None of these market-risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds. These investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio. From time to time, we invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities including municipal bond securities, U.S. government agency securities and high-grade corporate bonds that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity. Because of the short-term nature of these investments, we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk. The impact to our financial position and results of operations from likely changes in interest rates is not material. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value at September 30, 2024 due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2024, we evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
