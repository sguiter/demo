Loan Modifications Under certain circumstances, we may agree to modify the terms of an existing loan with a borrower for various reasons, including a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. We evaluate all loan modifications, which generally represent a continuation of the existing loan and not a new loan. For borrowers experiencing financial difficulties within the retail loan portfolio segment, we may provide contract term extensions. For borrowers experiencing financial difficulties within the dealer product portfolio segment, we may provide contract term extensions, interest rate adjustments, waivers of loan covenants, or any combination of the three. The effect of these modifications is already included in the allowance for credit losses because our estimated allowance represents currently expected credit losses. The amortized cost at September 30, 2024 and 2023 of the loans modified during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not significant. The unpaid principal balances, net of recoveries, of loans charged off during the reporting period that were modified within 12 months preceding default were not significant for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Secured notes and loans payable 

Total debt 

The carrying value of our debt includes unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs and the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments. Weighted average contractual interest rates are calculated based on original notional or par value before consideration of premium or discount and approximate the effective interest rates. Debt is callable at par value. Unsecured Notes and Loans Payable Our unsecured notes and loans payable consist of commercial paper and fixed and variable rate debt. Short-term funding needs are met through the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. Amount outstanding under our commercial paper programs was billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Upon issuance of fixed rate debt, we generally elect to enter into pay-float swaps to convert fixed rate payments on debt to floating rate payments. Certain unsecured notes and loans payable are denominated in various foreign currencies. The debt is translated into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate at the transaction date and retranslated at each balance sheet date using the exchange rate in effect at that date. Concurrent with the issuance of these foreign currency unsecured notes and loans payable, we enter into currency swaps in the same notional amount to convert non-U.S. currency payments to U.S. dollar denominated payments. Gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions are included in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain of our unsecured notes and loans payable contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. We are currently in compliance with these covenants and conditions. Secured Notes and Loans Payable Our secured notes and loans payable are denominated in U.S. dollars and consist of both fixed and variable rate debt. Secured notes and loans payable are issued using on-balance sheet securitization trusts, as further discussed in Note 8 Variable Interest Entities . These notes are repayable only from collections on the underlying securitized retail finance receivables and the beneficial interests in investments in operating leases and from related credit enhancements. Some of our secured notes are backed by a revolving pool of finance receivables and cash collateral, with the ability to repay the notes in full after the revolving period ends, after which an amortization period begins.

 billion 364-day syndicated bank credit facility, a billion three-year syndicated bank credit facility, and a billion five-year syndicated bank credit facility, expiring in fiscal years ending March 31, 2025, 2027, and 2029, respectively. The ability to make draws is subject to covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. These agreements were t drawn upon and had outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above. Committed Revolving Asset-backed Facility We are party to a 364-day revolving securitization facility with certain bank-sponsored asset-backed conduits and other financial institutions expiring in fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of this facility, the committed lenders under the facility have committed to make advances up to a facility limit of billion backed by eligible retail finance receivables transferred by us to a special-purpose entity acting as borrower. We utilized billion and billion of this facility as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Other Unsecured Credit Agreements TMCC is party to additional unsecured credit facilities with various banks. As of September 30, 2024, TMCC had committed bank credit facilities totaling billion , of which billion , million , billion , and million mature in fiscal years ending March 31, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively. These credit agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. These credit facilities were t drawn upon and had outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above. TMCC is party to a billion three-year revolving credit facility with Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. expiring in fiscal year ending March 31, 2027 . This credit facility was t drawn upon and had outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. From time to time, we may borrow from affiliates based upon a number of business factors such as funds availability, cash flow timing, relative cost of funds, and market access capabilities. Amounts borrowed from affiliates are recorded in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Net securitized assets shown in the preceding tables are presented net of deferred fees and costs, deferred income, accumulated depreciation and allowance for credit losses. Other assets represent accrued interests related to securitized retail finance receivables and used vehicles held-for-sale that were repossessed by or returned to TMCC for the benefit of the VIEs. The related debt of these consolidated VIEs is presented net of billion of securities retained by TMCC at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Other liabilities represent accrued interest on the debt of the consolidated VIEs. The assets of the VIEs and the restricted cash and cash equivalents held by TMCC serve as the sole source of repayment for the asset-backed securities issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to us or our other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities. As the primary beneficiary of these entities, we are exposed to credit, residual value, interest rate, and prepayment risk from the Securitized Assets in the VIEs. However, our exposure to these risks did not change as a result of the transfer of the assets to the VIEs. We may also be exposed to interest rate risk arising from the secured notes issued by the VIEs. In addition, we entered into interest rate swaps with certain special purpose entities that issue variable rate debt. Under the terms of these swaps, the special purpose entities are obligated to pay TMCC a fixed rate of interest on certain payment dates in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on notional amounts equal to the outstanding balance of the secured debt. This arrangement enables the special purpose entities to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in issuing variable rate debt that is secured by fixed rate Securitized Assets.

Total commitments 

Guarantees of affiliate pollution control and solid waste disposal bonds 

Total commitments and guarantees 

Wholesale financing is not considered to be a contractual commitment as the arrangements are not binding arrangements under which TMCC is required to perform. Commitments We provide fixed and variable rate working capital loans, revolving lines of credit, and real estate financing to dealers and various multi-franchise organizations referred to as dealer groups for facilities construction and refurbishment, working capital requirements, real estate purchases, business acquisitions and other general business purposes. These loans are typically secured with liens on real estate, vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate, and may be guaranteed by individual or corporate guarantees of affiliated dealers, dealer groups, or dealer principals. Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover our exposure under such agreements. Our pricing reflects market conditions, the competitive environment, the level of support dealers provide our retail, lease and voluntary protection business and the creditworthiness of each dealer. Amounts drawn under these facilities are reviewed for collectability on a quarterly basis, in conjunction with our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses. In addition to the total commitments and guarantees in the preceding table, we have also extended credit facilities to affiliates as described in Note 12 Related Party Transactions in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. Lease Commitments Our operating lease portfolio consists of real estate leases. We have a lease agreement through with TMNA for our headquarters facility in Plano, Texas. Commitments under operating lease agreements in the preceding table include million and million for facilities leases with affiliates at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.

 million in principal that were issued by Putnam County, West Virginia and Gibson County, Indiana to finance the construction of pollution control facilities at manufacturing plants of certain TMCC affiliates. The bonds mature in the following fiscal years ending March 31: 2028 - million; 2029 - million; 2030 - million; 2031 - million; and 2032 - million. TMCC would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event of non-payment on the bonds and other related obligations. TMCC is entitled to reimbursement by the applicable affiliates for any amounts paid. TMCC receives a nominal annual fee for guaranteeing such payments. TMCC has not been required to perform under any of these affiliate bond guarantees as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. Indemnification In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements containing indemnification provisions standard in the industry related to several types of transactions, including, but not limited to, debt funding, derivatives, securitization transactions, and our vendor, supplier and service agreements. Performance under these indemnities would generally occur upon a breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or other commitments made or given in the agreement, or as a result of a third-party claim. In addition, we have agreed in certain debt and derivative issuances, and subject to certain exceptions, to gross-up payments due to third parties in the event that withholding tax is imposed on such payments. In addition, certain of our funding arrangements may require us to pay lenders for increased costs due to certain changes in laws or regulations. Due to the difficulty in predicting events which could cause a breach of the indemnification provisions or trigger a gross-up or other payment obligation, we are not able to estimate our maximum exposure to future payments that could result from claims made under such provisions. We have not made any material payments in the past as a result of these provisions, and as of September 30, 2024, we determined that it is not probable that we will be required to make any material payments in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 , amounts have been recorded under these indemnification provisions. L itigation and Governmental Proceedings Various legal actions, governmental proceedings and other claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these actions are or purport to be class action suits, seeking sizeable damages and/or changes in our business operations, policies and practices. Certain of these actions are similar to suits that have been filed against other financial institutions and captive finance companies. In addition, we are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, and investigations from time to time at the state and federal levels. It is inherently difficult to predict the course of such legal actions and governmental inquiries. We perform periodic reviews of pending claims and actions to determine the probability of adverse verdicts and resulting amounts of liability. We establish accruals for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. When we are able, we also determine estimates of reasonable possibility of loss or range of loss, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability. Given the inherent uncertainty associated with legal matters, the actual costs of resolving legal claims and associated costs of defense may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts for which accruals have been established. Based on available information and established accruals, we do not believe it is reasonably probable that the results of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

 million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to million and million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. Our effective tax rate was percent for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to percent and percent for the same periods in fiscal 2024. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes. The lower effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, was primarily attributable to the decrease in state tax provision in the current year and the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to mark-to-market of investments in marketable securities recorded in fiscal 2024. Tax-related Contingencies As of September 30, 2024, we remain under IRS examination for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2025. We periodically review our uncertain tax positions. Our assessment is based on many factors including any ongoing IRS audits. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our assessment did not result in a material change in unrecognized tax benefits. Our deferred tax assets include the cumulative state net operating loss carry forwards, deferred deduction of allowance for credit losses and residual value loss estimates, mark-to-market adjustment of derivatives, and other deferred costs. The total deferred tax liability, net of these deferred tax assets, was billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 , respectively. Although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced if management s estimates change.

Accrued interest related to finance receivables is in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, TMCC measures the fair value of each class of finance receivables using scheduled principal and interest payments. Therefore, accrued interest has been included in the carrying value of each class of finance receivables in the preceding tables, along with the finance receivables, deferred origination costs, deferred income, and allowance for credit losses. Finance receivables in the preceding tables exclude related party transactions which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The preceding tables also exclude related party notes receivables and notes payables recorded in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

OVERVIEW 
 Key Performance Indicators and Factors Affecting Our Business 
 In our finance operations, we generate revenue, income, and cash flows by providing retail, lease, and dealer financing to dealers and their customers. We measure the performance of our finance operations using the following metrics: financing volume, market share, Net financing revenues, Operating and administrative expense, residual value and credit loss metrics. 
 In our voluntary protection operations, we generate revenue primarily through underwriting and providing claims administration for products that cover certain risks of customers. We measure the performance of our voluntary protection operations using the following metrics: issued contract volume, average number of contracts in force, loss metrics and investment income. 
 Our financial results are affected by a variety of economic and industry factors including, but not limited to, new and used vehicle markets, Toyota, Lexus, and private label new vehicle production volume, vehicle inventory levels, vehicle sales and incentive programs, consumer behavior, employment levels, our ability to respond to changes in inflation and interest rates with respect to both contract pricing and funding, the actual or perceived quality, safety or reliability of Toyota, Lexus, and private label vehicles, the financial health of the dealers we finance, and competitive pressure. Our financial results may also be affected by the regulatory environment in which we operate, including as a result of new legislation or changes in regulation and any compliance costs or changes we may be required to make to our business practices. All of these factors can influence consumer contract and dealer financing volume, the number of consumer contracts and dealers that default and the loss per occurrence, our inability to realize originally estimated contractual residual values on leased vehicles, the volume and performance of our voluntary protection operations, and our Net financing revenues on consumer and dealer financing volume. Changes in the volume of vehicle sales, sales of our voluntary protection products, or the level of voluntary protection expenses and insurance losses could materially and adversely impact our voluntary protection operations. Additionally, our funding programs and related costs are influenced by changes in the global capital markets, prevailing interest rates, and our credit ratings and those of our parent companies, which may affect our ability to obtain cost effective funding to support earning asset growth.

Table of Contents 

Fiscal 2025 First Six Months Operating Environment 
 During the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 fiscal 2025 ), the United States U.S. economy continued to be impacted by higher interest rates and consumer price increases, which have had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our cost of capital and the rates we charge to our customers and dealers which negatively impacts our financing volumes and market share, as a result of customers and dealers seeking alternative solutions or increasing the amount of cash purchases, thereby resulting in a decline of our competitive position. These economic conditions have also negatively impacted some consumers ability to make scheduled payments which has resulted in an increase in consumer delinquencies and charge-offs. 
 While economic conditions had an adverse effect, a general increase of inventory levels of new vehicles, along with an increase in sale incentives, resulted in relatively consistent industry-wide vehicle sales in the U.S. for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. There has been a decline in average used vehicle values in the first half of fiscal 2025; however, values still remained elevated compared to historic levels. Additional future declines in used vehicle values resulting from increases in the supply of new and used vehicles and increases in new vehicle sales incentives could unfavorably impact return rates, residual values, depreciation expense and credit losses. 
 We continue to maintain broad global access to both domestic and international funding markets. Conditions in the global capital markets were generally stable during the first half of fiscal 2025, although interest rates remained elevated as a result of the central banks efforts to lower inflation to target levels. During the first half of fiscal 2025, our interest expense increased as compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 as a result of higher interest rates. Future disruptions and changes in interest rates in the U.S. and foreign markets could result in volatility in our interest expense, which could affect our results of operations. 
 Mazda Financial Services Transition Plan 
 We have continued to evaluate the private label financial services business, including partnering with or transitioning the business to our affiliates. In August 2024, management presented a plan to the Board of Directors Board of TMCC to transition the origination and financing of new automotive finance and lease contracts under the Mazda Financial Services MFS Agreement to Toyota Financial Savings Bank TFSB ), an unconsolidated affiliate of TMCC, subject to the successful completion of a trial run with certain Mazda dealers commencing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 (the MFS Transition Plan ). As it was deemed to be in the best interests of the Corporation and its sole shareholder, Toyota Financial Services International Corporation, the Board approved the MFS Transition Plan, including all costs and expenses incurred with the transition, which are not expected to be significant. No existing TMCC private label assets or liabilities will be transitioned to or acquired by TFSB pursuant to the MFS Transition Plan. 
 In connection with the MFS Transition Plan, TMCC has entered into certain servicing agreements with TFSB to service the retail and lease contracts originated under the MFS Agreement by TFSB. TMCC will continue to offer voluntary protection products to MFS customers. 
 The MFS Transition Plan, if fully implemented, will include the origination of all new MFS retail and lease contracts by TFSB rather than TMCC and is anticipated to affect our results of operation and financial statements by reducing financing revenue and related expenses reported on our consolidated statements of income and reducing finance receivables, net and investments in operating leases, net reported on our consolidated balance sheets. Revenue to be earned from service fees related to originating and servicing new MFS retail and lease contracts on behalf of TFSB is not expected to offset the reduction in financing revenue resulting from the implementation of the MFS Transition Plan. The implementation of the MFS Transition Plan is also expected to reduce our future funding needs.

 Our consolidated net income was 786 million and 429 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 570 million and 178 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. 
 The increase in net income for first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to a 616 million increase in total financing revenues, a 467 million increase in investment and other income, net, a 46 million increase in voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums, and a 24 million decrease in depreciation on operating leases, partially offset by a 856 million increase in interest expense, a 47 million increase in provision for income taxes, and a 29 million increase in voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses. 
 The increase in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to a 406 million increase in investment and other income, net, a 311 million increase in total financing revenues, a 22 million increase in voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums, and a 15 million decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 312 million increase in interest expense, a 97 million increase in depreciation on operating leases, a 74 million increase in provision for income taxes, and a 16 million increase in voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses. 
 Our overall capital position increased 805 million, bringing total shareholder s equity to 17.8 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.0 billion at March 31, 2024. Our debt increased to 126.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from 122.4 billion at March 31, 2024. Our debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 7.1 at September 30, 2024 from 7.2 at March 31, 2024.

Our finance operations reported net income of 517 million and 222 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 625 million and 279 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. 
 The decrease in net income from finance operations for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to an 856 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a 616 million increase in total financing revenues, a 69 million increase in investment and other income, net, a 41 million decrease in provision for income taxes, and a 24 million decrease in depreciation on operating leases. 
 The decrease in net income from finance operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a 312 million increase in interest expense and a 97 million increase in depreciation on operating leases, partially offset by a 311 million increase in total financing revenues, a 17 million increase in investment and other income, net, and a 15 million decrease in provision for credit losses. 
 Financing Revenues 
 Total financing revenues increased 10 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024 due to the following: 
 Operating lease revenues decreased 4 percent and 2 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, primarily due to lower average outstanding earning asset balances. 

Retail financing revenues increased 26 percent and 23 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, due to higher yields and higher average outstanding earning asset balances. 

Dealer financing revenues increased 38 percent and 32 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, due to higher average outstanding earning asset balances and higher yields. 

As a result of the above, our total portfolio yield, which includes operating lease, retail and dealer financing revenues, was 6.7 percent and 6.8 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 6.1 percent and 6.5 percent for the same periods in fiscal 2024.

Depreciation on Operating Leases 
 We recorded depreciation on operating leases of 2.0 billion for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to 2.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2024. The decrease in depreciation on operating leases for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was due to lower average operating lease units outstanding, mostly offset by higher expected residual value losses. We recorded depreciation on operating leases of 1.0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 918 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in depreciation on operating leases for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to higher expected residual value losses, partially offset by lower average operating lease units outstanding. 
 Declines in used vehicle values resulting from increases in the supply of new vehicles and increases in new vehicle sales incentives could unfavorably impact return rates, residual values, and depreciation expense in the future. 
 Interest Expense 
 Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and variable rate debt, denominated in U.S. dollars and various other currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables. We enter into interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities. The following table summarizes the components of interest expense:

During the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, total interest expense increased to 3.0 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively, from 2.2 billion and 1.3 billion for the same periods in fiscal 2024. The increase in total interest expense for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense on debt and derivatives, losses on U.S. dollar interest rate swaps, partially offset by changes on debt denominated in foreign currencies net of foreign currency swaps. 
 Interest expense on debt and derivatives primarily represents contractual net interest settlements and changes in accruals on secured and unsecured notes and loans payable and derivatives, and includes amortization of discounts, premiums, and debt issuance costs. During the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, interest expense on debt and derivatives combined increased to 2.7 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively, from 1.9 billion and 984 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. The increase in interest expense on debt is primarily due to an increase in weighted average interest rates and debt outstanding. The decrease in interest income on derivatives is primarily due to a decrease in net interest income on pay-fixed swaps. 
 Gains or losses on debt denominated in foreign currencies represent the impact of translation adjustments. We use foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the debt denominated in foreign currencies. During the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, we recorded net gains of 205 million and 232 million, respectively, primarily due to decreases in foreign currency swap rates across the various currencies in which our debt is denominated. During the first half of fiscal 2024, we recorded net losses of 54 million, primarily due to increases in foreign currency swap rates across the various currencies in which our debt is denominated. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded net gains of 27 million, as the impact from net interest income outweighed the impact attributable to yield curve movements. 
 Gains or losses on U.S. dollar interest rate swaps represent the change in the valuation of interest rate swaps. During the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, we recorded losses of 500 million and 431 million, respectively, primarily due to a downward shift of U.S. dollar swap rates resulting in losses on pay-fixed swaps exceeding gains on our pay-float swaps. During the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded losses of 256 million and 315 million, respectively, as the impact from net interest income outweighed the impact attributable to increases in U.S. dollar swap rates.

Future changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates could continue to result in significant volatility in our interest expense, thereby affecting our results of operations. 
 Investment and Other Income, Net 
 We recorded investment and other income, net of 302 million and 136 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 233 million and 119 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. The increase in investment and other income, net for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to higher yields and higher average balances on our cash and cash equivalents. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of 395 million and 206 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 386 million and 221 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. The increase in provision for credit losses for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was due to an increase in consumer delinquencies and charge-offs, partially offset by lower growth of our retail loan and dealer portfolios. 
 The decrease in the provision for credit losses in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was due to lower growth of our retail loan and dealer portfolios, partially offset by an increase in consumer delinquencies and charge-offs. 
 Operating and Administrative Expenses 
 We recorded operating and administrative expenses of 659 million and 332 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 666 million and 332 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024.

 The increase in net income from voluntary protection operations for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to a 398 million increase in investment and other income (loss), net and a 46 million increase in voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums, partially offset by an 88 million increase in provision for income taxes, and a 29 million increase in voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses. 
 The increase in net income from voluntary protection operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to a 389 million increase in investment and other income, net and a 22 million increase in voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums, partially offset by an 83 million increase in provision for income taxes, and a 16 million increase in voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses. 
 Contracts issued increased 4 percent and 2 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, primarily due to growth in our private label business. The average number of contracts in force increased 5 percent and 3 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, due to net growth in the voluntary protection portfolio primarily in prepaid maintenance contracts. 
 Revenue from Voluntary Protection Operations 
 Our voluntary protection operations reported voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums of 595 million and 300 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 549 million and 278 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. Voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums represent revenues from in force contracts and are affected by issuances as well as the level of coverage, age, and mix of in force contracts. Voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums are recognized over the term of the contracts in relation to the timing and level of anticipated claims. The increase in voluntary protection contract revenues and insurance earned premiums for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to an increase in our average in force contracts resulting from net growth in the voluntary protection portfolio.

Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net 
 Our voluntary protection operations reported investment and other income, net of 309 million and 252 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to investment and other loss, net of 89 million and 137 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. Investment and other income, net, consists primarily of dividend and interest income, realized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities, changes in fair value from equity and available-for-sale debt securities for which the fair value option was elected, and credit loss expense on available-for-sale debt securities, if any. The increase in investment and other income, net for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to gains from changes in fair value on our equity investments and available-for-sale debt securities for which the fair value option was elected, as a result of market volatility, and increased interest income due to higher interest rates. 
 Voluntary Protection Contract Expenses and Insurance Losses 
 Our voluntary protection operations reported voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses of 320 million and 161 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 291 million and 145 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. Voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses incurred are a function of the amount of covered risks, the frequency and severity of claims associated with in force contracts, and the level of risk retained by our voluntary protection operations. Voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses include amounts paid and accrued for reported losses, estimates of losses incurred but not reported, and any related claim adjustment expenses. The increase in voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to an increase in frequency of claims in our prepaid maintenance contracts and an increase in frequency and severity of claims in our guaranteed auto protection and vehicle service contracts. The increase in voluntary protection contract expenses and insurance losses for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to an increase in frequency of claims in our prepaid maintenance contracts and an increase in frequency and severity of claims in our vehicle service contracts. 
 Operating and Administrative Expenses 
 Our voluntary protection operations reported operating and administrative expenses of 234 million and 121 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 231 million and 117 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Our provision for income taxes was 242 million and 137 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 195 million and 63 million for the same periods in fiscal 2024. Our effective tax rate was 24 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to 25 percent and 26 percent for the same periods in fiscal 2024. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes. The lower effective tax rate for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, was primarily attributable to the decrease in state tax provision in the current year and the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to mark-to-market of investments in marketable securities recorded in fiscal 2024.

Total financing volume was comprised of approximately 80 percent Toyota/Lexus, 15 percent private label, and 5 percent non-Toyota/Lexus/private label for the first half of fiscal 2024. Total financing volume was comprised of approximately 81 percent Toyota/Lexus, 14 percent private label, and 5 percent non-Toyota/Lexus/private label for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 

2 TMNA subvened volume units are included in the total vehicle financing. Units exclude third-party subvened units. 

3 Represents the percentage of total domestic TMNA sales of new Toyota and Lexus vehicles financed by us, excluding sales under dealer rental car and commercial fleet programs, sales of a private Toyota distributor and private label vehicles financed. 

Vehicle Financing Volume 
 The volume of our retail and lease contracts, which are acquired primarily from Toyota, Lexus, and private label dealers, is dependent upon TMNA and private label sales volume, the level of TMNA, private label, and third-party sponsored subvention and other incentive programs, as well as TMCC competitive rate and other incentive programs. 
 Our financing volume increased 4 percent for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher levels of subvention and other incentives programs, as well as the availability of new vehicles in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Our financing volume decreased 3 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, primarily due to a decrease in used retail contracts from lower levels of subvention and other incentives programs, mostly offset by an increase in lease contracts from higher levels of subvention and other incentives programs. 
 Our market share of TMNA sales increased approximately 4 percentage points and approximately 3 percentage points for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher levels of subvention and other incentives programs.

Despite higher levels of subvention and other incentives programs, our new retail contract volume decreased 3 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, primarily due to lower new vehicles inventory levels. 
 Our used retail contracts decreased 24 percent and 33 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, due to increased competition in the used vehicle marketplace as well as lower levels of subvention and other incentives programs. 
 Our retail finance receivables, net increased 2 percent at September 30, 2024 as compared to March 31, 2024 due to higher retail contracts outstanding and higher average amount financed. 
 Lease Contract Volume and Earning Assets 
 Our lease contract volume increased 43 percent and 41 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher levels of subvention and other incentives programs. Our investments in operating leases, net, increased 2 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to March 31, 2024, primarily due to higher vehicle values. 
 Dealer Financing and Earning Assets 
 Dealer financing, net increased 1 percent at September 30, 2024, as compared to March 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in financing for revolving lines of credit and real estate.

Residual Value Risk 
 The primary factors affecting our exposure to residual value risk are the levels at which residual values are established at lease inception, current economic conditions and outlook, projected end-of-term market values, and the resulting impact on depreciation expense and lease return rates. Higher average operating lease units outstanding and the resulting increase in future maturities, a higher supply of used vehicles, as well as future deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values for Toyota, Lexus, and private label vehicles could unfavorably impact return rates, residual values, and depreciation expense. 
 On a quarterly basis, we review the estimated end-of-term market values of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of our carrying values. To the extent the estimated end-of-term market value of a leased vehicle is lower than the residual value established at lease inception, the residual value of the leased vehicle is adjusted downward so that the carrying value at lease end will approximate the estimated end-of-term market value. For investments in operating leases, adjustments are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining terms of the lease contracts and are included in Depreciation on operating leases in our Consolidated Statements of Income as a change in accounting estimate.

Depreciation expense on operating leases decreased 1 percent for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, due to lower average operating lease units outstanding, mostly offset by higher expected residual value losses. Depreciation expense on operating leases increased 11 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher expected residual value losses, partially offset by lower average operating lease units outstanding. 
 Declines in used vehicle values resulting from increases in the supply of new vehicles and increases in new vehicle sales incentives could unfavorably impact return rates, residual values, and depreciation expense in the future.

Origination, Credit Loss, and Delinquency Experience 
 Our credit loss experience may be affected by a number of factors including the economic environment, our purchasing, servicing and collections practices, used vehicle market conditions and subvention. Changes in the economy that impact the consumer such as increasing interest rates, and a rise in the unemployment rate as well as higher debt balances, coupled with deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values, could increase our credit losses. In addition, a decline in the effectiveness of our collection practices could also increase our credit losses. We continuously evaluate and refine our purchasing practices and collection efforts to minimize risk. In addition, subvention contributes to our overall portfolio quality, as subvened contracts typically have higher credit scores than non-subvened contracts.

 5 	Excludes accrued interest from average finance receivables. 
 Management considers historical credit loss information when assessing the allowance for credit losses. Historical credit losses are primarily driven by two factors: default frequency and loss severity. Our net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables for the first half of fiscal 2025 increased to 0.69 percent from 0.57 percent for the same period in fiscal 2024. Our default frequency as a percentage of outstanding finance receivable contracts increased to 1.48 percent for the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to 1.20 percent in the same period in fiscal 2024. The increases in net charge-offs and default frequency were due to an increase in higher average amounts financed and economic conditions, including consumer price increases and higher interest rates, have negatively impacted some consumers ability to make scheduled payments. Our average finance receivables loss severity per unit for the first half of fiscal 2025 increased to 13,871 from 13,534 in the first half of fiscal 2024. The increase in loss severity is primarily due to higher average amounts financed, partially offset by a decrease in full balance charge offs in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Our aggregate balances for accounts 60 or more days past due as a percentage of finance receivables was 0.78 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.68 percent at September 30, 2023, and 0.64 percent at March 31, 2024. Our aggregate balances for accounts 60 or more days past due as a percentage of operating leases was 0.54 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.44 percent at September 30, 2023, and 0.48 percent at March 31, 2024. The increase in our aggregate balances for accounts 60 or more days past due as a percentage of finance receivables and operating leases was primarily due to the economic conditions.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses which is measured by an impairment model that reflects lifetime expected losses. 
 The allowance for credit losses for our retail loan portfolio is measured on a collective basis when loans have similar risk characteristics such as loan-to-value ratio, book payment-to-income ratio, FICO score at origination, collateral type (new or used, Lexus, Toyota, or private label), contract term, and other relevant factors. We use statistical models to estimate lifetime expected credit losses of our retail loan portfolio segment by applying probability of default and loss given default to the exposure at default on a loan level basis. Probability of default models are developed from internal risk scoring models which consider variables such as delinquency status, historical default frequency, and other credit quality indicators. Other credit quality indicators include loan-to-value ratio, book payment-to-income ratio, FICO score at origination, collateral type, and contract term. Loss given default models forecast the extent of losses given that a default has occurred and consider variables such as collateral, trends in recoveries, historical loss severity, and other contract structure variables. Exposure at default represents the expected outstanding principal balance, including the effects of expected prepayment when applicable. The lifetime expected credit losses incorporate the probability-weighted forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts for baseline, favorable, and adverse scenarios. The loan lifetime is regarded by management as the reasonable and supportable period. We use macroeconomic forecasts from a third party and update such forecasts quarterly. On an ongoing basis, we review our models, including macroeconomic factors, the selection of macroeconomic scenarios and their weighting to ensure they reflect the risk of the portfolio. 
 For the allowance for credit losses for our dealer portfolio, an allowance for credit losses is established for both outstanding dealer finance receivables and certain unfunded off-balance sheet lending commitments. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis when loans have similar risk characteristics such as dealer group internal risk rating and loan-to-value ratios. We measure lifetime expected credit losses of our dealer products portfolio segment by applying probability of default and loss given default to the exposure at default on a loan level basis. Probability of default is primarily established based on internal risk assessments. The probability of default model also considers qualitative factors related to macroeconomic outlooks. Loss given default is established based on the nature and market value of the collateral, loan-to-value ratios and other credit quality indicators. Exposure at default represents the expected outstanding principal balance. The lifetime of the loan or lending commitment is regarded by management as the reasonable and supportable period. On an ongoing basis, we review our models and the macroeconomic outlook, to ensure they reflect the risk of the portfolio. 
 If management does not believe the models adequately reflect lifetime expected credit losses, a qualitative adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding observable changes in recent or expected economic trends and conditions, portfolio composition, and other relevant factors.

 Our allowance for credit losses increased by 81 million from 1.6 billion at September 30, 2023 to 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024, due to an increase in size of our retail loan portfolio and an increase in consumer delinquencies and charge-offs. 
 Future changes in the economy that impact the consumer and consumer confidence such as increasing interest rates and a rise in the unemployment rate as well as higher debt balances, coupled with deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values, could result in further increases to our allowance for credit losses. In addition, a decline in the effectiveness of our collection practices could also increase our allowance for credit losses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash Requirements 
 Our primary material cash requirements include the acquisition of finance receivables and investment in operating leases from dealers, providing various financing to dealers, payments related to debt and swaps, operating expenses, voluntary protection contract expenses, income taxes, and dividend payments. 
 Guarantees 
 TMCC has guaranteed the payments of principal and interest with respect to the bond obligations that were issued by Putnam County, West Virginia and Gibson County, Indiana to finance the construction of pollution control facilities at manufacturing plants of certain TMCC affiliates. Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 Commitments 
 A description of our lending commitments is included under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 12 - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, as well as in Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Indemnification 
 Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of agreements containing indemnification provisions. 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity risk is the risk relating to our ability to meet our financial obligations when they come due. Our liquidity strategy is to ensure that we maintain the ability to fund assets and repay liabilities in a timely and cost-effective manner, even in adverse market conditions. Our strategy includes raising funds via the global capital markets and through loans, credit facilities, and other transactions as well as generating liquidity from our earning assets. This strategy has led us to develop a diversified borrowing base that is distributed across a variety of markets, geographies, investors, and financing structures. 
 Liquidity management involves forecasting and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our cash needs, including unanticipated events. To ensure adequate liquidity through a full range of potential operating environments and market conditions, we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility and diversity. Key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on developing and maintaining direct relationships with commercial paper investors and wholesale market funding providers and maintaining the ability to sell certain assets when and if conditions warrant. 
 We develop and maintain contingency funding plans and regularly evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances, allowing us to assess how we will be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of capital is constrained. The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, and outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period. In addition, we monitor the ratings and credit exposure of the lenders that participate in our credit facilities to ascertain any issues that may arise with potential draws on these facilities if that contingency becomes warranted. 
 We maintain broad access to a variety of domestic and global markets and may choose to realign our funding activities depending upon market conditions, relative costs, and other factors. We believe that our funding sources, combined with operating and investing activities, provide sufficient liquidity to meet future funding requirements and business growth. For liquidity purposes, we hold cash in excess of our immediate funding needs. These excess funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid and investment grade money market instruments, which provide liquidity for our short-term funding needs and flexibility in the use of our other funding sources. We maintained excess funds ranging from 4.9 billion to 10.6 billion with an average balance of 7.6 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The amount of excess funds we hold excludes amounts related to voluntary protection operations, and may fluctuate, depending on market conditions and other factors. We also have access to liquidity under a 5.0 billion credit facility with Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. TMS ), which as of September 30, 2024, was not drawn upon and had no outstanding balance as further described in Note 7 Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe we have sufficient capacity to meet our short-term funding requirements and manage our liquidity, including payment of dividends.

Commercial paper 
 Short-term funding needs are met through the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. Commercial paper outstanding under our commercial paper programs ranged from approximately 17.3 billion to 18.0 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, with an average outstanding balance of 17.6 billion. Our commercial paper programs are supported by the credit facilities discussed under the heading Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit. We believe we have sufficient capacity to meet our short-term funding requirements and manage our liquidity. 
 MTN program 
 We maintain a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to provide for the issuance of debt securities in the U.S. capital markets to retail and institutional investors. We currently qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules, which allows us to issue under our registration statement an unlimited amount of debt securities during the three-year period ending January 2027. Debt securities issued under the U.S. shelf registration statement are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture which requires TMCC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge and cross-default provisions. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. 
 
 EMTN program 
 Our EMTN program, shared with our affiliates Toyota Motor Finance (Netherlands) B.V., Toyota Credit Canada Inc. and Toyota Finance Australia Limited (TMCC and such affiliates, the EMTN Issuers ), provides for the issuance of debt securities in the international capital markets. In September 2024, the EMTN Issuers renewed the EMTN program for a one-year period. The maximum aggregate principal amount authorized under the EMTN Program to be outstanding at any time is 60.0 billion or the equivalent in other currencies. The authorized amount is shared among all EMTN Issuers. The authorized aggregate principal amount under the EMTN program may be increased from time to time. Debt securities issued under the EMTN program are issued pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement. Certain debt securities issued under the EMTN program are subject to negative pledge provisions. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. 
 Other debt 
 TMCC has entered into term loan agreements with various banks. These term loan agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. We are currently in compliance with these covenants and conditions. 
 We may borrow from affiliates on terms based upon a number of business factors such as funds availability, cash flow timing, relative cost of funds, and market access capabilities. Amounts borrowed from affiliates are recorded in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are therefore excluded from Debt amounts.

We securitize finance receivables and beneficial interests in investments in operating leases Securitized Assets using a variety of structures. Our securitization transactions involve the transfer of Securitized Assets to bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. These bankruptcy-remote entities are used to ensure that the Securitized Assets are isolated from the claims of creditors of TMCC and that the cash flows from these assets are available solely for the benefit of the investors in these asset-backed securities. Investors in asset-backed securities do not have recourse to our other assets, and neither TMCC nor our affiliates guarantee these obligations. We are not required to repurchase or make reallocation payments with respect to the Securitized Assets that become delinquent or default after securitization. As seller and servicer of the Securitized Assets, we are required to repurchase or make a reallocation payment with respect to the underlying assets that are subsequently discovered not to have met specified eligibility requirements. This repurchase obligation is customary in securitization transactions. With the exception of our revolving asset-backed securitization program, funding obtained from our securitization transactions is repaid as the underlying Securitized Assets amortize. 
 We service the Securitized Assets in accordance with our customary servicing practices and procedures. Our servicing duties include collecting payments on Securitized Assets and submitting them to a trustee for distribution to security holders and other interest holders. We prepare monthly servicer certificates on the performance of the Securitized Assets, including collections, investor distributions, delinquencies, and credit losses. We also perform administrative services for the special purpose entities. 
 Our use of special purpose entities in securitizations is consistent with conventional practice in the securitization market. None of our officers, directors, or employees hold any equity interests or receive any direct or indirect compensation from our special purpose entities. These entities do not own our stock or the stock of any of our affiliates. Each special purpose entity has a limited purpose and generally is permitted only to purchase assets, issue asset-backed securities, and make payments to the security holders, other interest holders and certain service providers as required under the terms of the transactions. 
 Our securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancement to reduce the risk of loss to security holders and other interest holders in the asset-backed securities. Credit enhancement may include some or all of the following: 
 Overcollateralization : The principal of the Securitized Assets that exceeds the principal amount of the related secured debt. 

Excess spread : The expected interest collections on the Securitized Assets that exceed the expected fees and expenses of the special purpose entity, including the interest payable on the debt, net of swap settlements, if any. 

Cash reserve funds: A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of asset-backed securities may be held by the securitization trust in a segregated reserve fund and may be used to pay principal and interest to security holders and other interest holders if collections on the underlying receivables are insufficient. 

Yield supplement arrangements : Additional overcollateralization may be provided to supplement the future contractual interest payments from securitized receivables with relatively low contractual interest rates. 

Subordinated notes : The subordination of principal and interest payments on subordinated notes may provide additional credit enhancement to holders of senior notes. 

52 

Table of Contents 

In addition to the credit enhancement described above, we may enter into interest rate swaps with our special purpose entities that issue variable rate debt. Under the terms of these swaps, the special purpose entities are obligated to pay TMCC a fixed rate of interest on payment dates in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on notional amounts equal to the outstanding balance of the secured notes and loans payable. This arrangement enables the special purpose entities to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in issuing variable rate debt that is secured by fixed rate Securitized Assets. 
 Securitized Assets and the related debt remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize financing revenue on the Securitized Assets. We also recognize interest expense on the secured notes and loans payable issued by the special purpose entities and maintain an allowance for credit losses on the Securitized Assets to cover estimated lifetime expected credit losses using a methodology consistent with that used for our non-securitized asset portfolio. The interest rate swaps between TMCC and the special purpose entities are considered intercompany transactions and therefore are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. 
 Our secured notes also include a revolving asset-backed securitization program backed by a revolving pool of finance receivables and cash collateral. Cash flows from these receivables during the revolving period in excess of what is needed to pay certain expenses of the securitization trust and contractual interest payments on the related secured notes may be used to purchase additional receivables, provided that certain conditions are met following the purchase. The secured notes feature a scheduled revolving period, with the ability to repay the secured notes in full, after which an amortization period begins. The revolving period may also end with the amortization period beginning upon the occurrence of certain events that include certain segregated account balances falling below their required levels, credit losses or delinquencies on the pool of assets supporting the secured notes exceeding specified levels, the adjusted pool balance falling to less than 50 of the initial principal amount of the secured notes, or interest not being paid on the secured notes. 
 Public Securitization 
 We maintain a shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide for the issuance of securities backed by Securitized Assets in the U.S. capital markets during the three-year period ending December 2024. We regularly sponsor public securitization trusts that issue securities backed by retail finance receivables, including registered securities that we retain. None of these securities have defaulted, experienced any events of default or failed to pay principal in full at maturity. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we did not have any outstanding lease securitization transactions registered with the SEC.

 We are party to a 364-day revolving securitization facility with certain bank-sponsored asset-backed conduits and other financial institutions expiring in fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of this facility, the committed lenders under the facility have committed to make advances up to a facility limit of 8.5 billion backed by eligible retail finance receivables transferred by us to a special-purpose entity acting as borrower. We utilized 4.5 billion and 3.4 billion of this facility as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. 
 Other Unsecured Credit Agreements 
 TMCC is party to additional unsecured credit facilities with various banks. As of September 30, 2024, TMCC had committed bank credit facilities totaling 4.6 billion of which 2.2 billion, 400 million, 1.7 billion, and 325 million mature in fiscal years ending March 31, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively. 
 These credit agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. These credit facilities were not drawn upon and had no outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above. 
 TMCC is party to a 5.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility with TMS expiring in fiscal year ending March 31, 2027. This credit facility was not drawn upon and had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. 
 From time to time, we may borrow from affiliates based upon a number of business factors such as funds availability, cash flow timing, relative cost of funds, and market access capabilities. 
 Credit Ratings 
 The cost and availability of unsecured financing is influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating organization. Each credit rating organization may have different criteria for evaluating risk, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each organization. Our credit ratings depend in part on the existence of the credit support agreements of TFSC and TMC. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on the credit ratings of TMCC and its parent companies and our credit support arrangements in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.

Derivative Instruments 
 Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and variable rate debt, denominated in U.S. dollars and various other currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables. We enter into interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities. Our use of derivative transactions is intended to reduce long-term fluctuations in the fair value of assets and liabilities caused by market movements. All of our derivatives are categorized as not designated for hedge accounting, and all of our derivative activities are authorized and monitored by our management and our Asset-Liability Committee which provides a framework for financial controls and governance to manage market risk.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates which affect reported financial results. The evaluation of the factors used in determining each of our critical accounting estimates involves significant assumptions, complex analyses, and management judgment. Changes in the evaluation of these factors may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates, and those differences could be material. The critical accounting estimates that affect the consolidated financial statements and the judgment and assumptions used are consistent with those described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ).

 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
