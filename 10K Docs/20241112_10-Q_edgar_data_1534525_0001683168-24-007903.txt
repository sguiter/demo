BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on
advancing innovative immune-oncology technologies addressing hard to treat cancers. Our DNase platform is designed to improve outcomes
of existing treatments, including immunotherapies, by targeting NETs, which have been implicated in cancer progression and resistance
to cancer treatments. We are currently focused on advancing our systemic DNase program into the clinic as an adjunctive therapy for pancreatic
carcinoma and locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Additionally, we have partnered with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies
to develop our proprietary drug delivery platform, PolyXen, and receive royalty payments under an exclusive license arrangement in the
field of blood coagulation disorders. 

We incorporate our patented and proprietary technologies
into drug candidates currently under development with biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry collaborators to create what we believe
will be the next-generation biologic drugs with improved pharmacological properties over existing therapeutics. Our drug candidates have
resulted from our research activities or that of our collaborators and are in the development stage. As a result, we have committed a
significant amount of our resources to our research and development activities and anticipate continuing to do so for the near future.
To date, none of our drug candidates have received regulatory marketing authorization or approval in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration
nor in any other countries or territories by any applicable agencies. We are receiving ongoing royalties pursuant to a license of our
PolyXen technology to an industry partner. Although we hold a broad patent portfolio, the focus of our internal efforts during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was on the advancement of our DNase technology.

Impact of the Global Conflicts on Our Operations 

The short and long-term implications of conflicts
in the Ukraine and the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of current and future sanctions and counter sanctions
may have an adverse effect on the economic markets generally and could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Revenue 

Revenue for the three months ended September 30,
2024 was relatively flat with that of the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research development R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 0.7 million, or 63.9 , to approximately 0.4 million
from approximately 1.0 million in the comparable quarter in 2023. The table below sets forth the R D costs incurred by the Company
by category of expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Quarter Ended, 
 
 Category of Expense 
 September 30, 2024

 Other 
 7,436 
 40,453 
 
 Total research and development expense 
 367,985 
 1,020,618 

The decrease in outside
services and contract research organizations expense was primarily due to decreased spending in connection with our process development
efforts related to our DNase platform. The decrease in personnel costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to
the three months ending September 30, 2023 is due to the departure of our former Chief Scientific Officer during the second quarter of
2024. 

16 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively flat with that of the three months ended September 30, 2023. Increases in legal fees during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 were offset by decreases is personnel costs during the third
quarter of 2024 due to the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in the second quarter of 2024. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income was approximately 1,500 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 700 of other expense for the comparable quarter in 2023. This increase
in other income was primarily related to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the three months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Interest Income 

Interest income, net decreased to approximately
 61,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 92,000 for the same period in the prior year. This decrease
was primarily due to lower average invested funds during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 

The comparison of our historical results of operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is as follows:

Research and Development Expenses 

R D expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 decreased by approximately 0.3 million, or 10.8 , to approximately 2.2 million from approximately 2.5 million in the comparable
period in 2023. The table below sets forth the R D costs incurred by the Company by category of expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Total research and development expense 
 2,246,077 
 2,519,137 

The decrease in outside services and contract
research organizations expense was primarily due to decreased spending in connection with our process development efforts, partially offset
by increased pre-clinical development efforts related to our DNase platform. The increase in personnel costs is due to certain severance
and benefits expensed in connection with a separation agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2024 with our former Chief Scientific
Officer. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 0.1 million, or 3.9 , to approximately 2.7 million from approximately 2.6
million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to certain severance and benefits expensed in connection with
a separation agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2024 with our former Chief Executive Officer. This increase was partially
offset by general decreases in accounting fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Other Income 

Other income was approximately 1,500 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 25,000 of other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This
decrease in other income was primarily related to fees associated with the Pharmsynthez Loan recognized during the nine months ended September
30, 2023 for which there was no similar fees received in the same period in 2024. 

Interest Income 

Interest income decreased to approximately 198,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 272,000 for the same period in the prior year. This decrease
was primarily due to lower average invested funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023,
as well as a decrease in interest income received on the Pharmsynthez Loan. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We incurred a net loss
of approximately 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately 196.1 million
at September 30, 2024, as compared to an accumulated deficit of approximately 193.2 million at December 31, 2023. Working capital was
approximately 6.0 million at September 30, 2024, and approximately 8.8 million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, our working capital decreased by approximately 2.8 million primarily due to our net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

Our principal source
of liquidity consists of cash. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 6.8 million in cash and approximately 1.0 million in current
liabilities. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 9.0 million in cash and approximately 0.8 million in current liabilities. We
have historically relied upon sales of our equity securities to fund our operations. 

18 

We evaluate whether there
are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. We have incurred substantial losses since our inception, and we expect
to continue to incur operating losses in the near-term. The Company believes that its existing resources will be adequate to fund the
Company s operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of the issuance of these financial statements. However,
we anticipate we will need additional capital in the long-term to pursue our business initiatives. While the Company believes it has access
to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations, related party funding,
or other means to continue as a going concern, the terms, timing and extent of any future financing will depend upon several factors,
including the achievement of progress in our clinical development programs, our ability to identify and enter into licensing or other
strategic arrangements, our continued listing on Nasdaq, and factors related to financial, economic, geo-political, industry and market
conditions, many of which are beyond our control. The capital markets for the biotech industry can be highly volatile, which make the
terms, timing and extent of any future financing uncertain. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Cash flows used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 2.1 million, which was primarily due to our net loss for the period, partially
offset by non-cash charges associated with share-based expense. In addition, prepaid expenses and other decreased approximately 0.4 million
and current liabilities increased approximately 0.2 million during the period. Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 totaled approximately 3.3 million, which was primarily due to our net loss for the period as well as advance
payments made in accordance with our statement of work with Catalent, partially offset by cash received from the repayment of the Pharmsynthez
Loan. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

There were no cash flows from investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 

There were no cash flows from financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

As of September 30, 2024, there were no material
changes in our contractual obligations and commitments from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, as amended on April 26, 2024. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet financing
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, change in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

See Note 3 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, as amended on April 26, 2024, for a discussion of recent accounting
standards. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The result of these evaluations forms the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results and outcomes may differ
materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates from
those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024,
as amended on April 26, 2024. 

19 

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are not required to provide the information
required by this Item because we are a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act). 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our
Interim Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 

Based on this evaluation, our management, including
our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that would have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

20 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are not currently subject to any material legal
proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain
legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of our business. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material changes to the risk
factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024,
as amended on April 26, 2024.
