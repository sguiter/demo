 Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements 

 For the Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 

 (Unaudited 

By the
end of 2024, we intend to generate revenue primarily through the sale of tariff plans for our cloud rendering services. To select the
tariff plan that best fits client s requirements, they are required to contact our team to subscribe and submit their project. This
allows us to choose the right tariff plan according to their project and the cloud rendering power needed. When estimating a project,
we assess the required number of hours and capacity necessary to fulfill the client's needs. The tariff plans may vary depending on the
number of video cards used to produce power (10, 25 and 40 video cards), as well as the time needed for rendering with a minimum option
of 5 hours. 

 Clients can contact
us using the information provided in the "Contacts" section on our website (https://global-smart.tech/contacts/). After determining
the project scope, the client proceeds with the payment. Once payment is received, we deliver the completed project, following the rendering
process, to the client via the email address provided in the form. Our primary target customers include 3D interior designers and visualizers
in the design industry. We aim to offer a range of flexible and competitive pricing options to attract clients and maximize revenue potential.
This revenue stream will be a key driver of our financial growth and sustainability in the foreseeable future.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Business Overview 

 We are an emerging technology company incorporated
under the laws of the state of Wyoming on April 15, 2022. As part of our business evolution, we are focusing on expanding our operations
in cloud rendering. Our primary objective is the development of an advanced platform dedicated to 3D interior designers and visualizers.
Leveraging the power of GPUs, our platform aims to transform the rendering process, delivering exceptional performance and revolutionizing
the industry. 

Plan of Operations 

 The Company s business model centers
on cloud rendering services. We believe that revenue growth and long-term profitability can be achieved in the year 2024 and beyond by
ensuring the technical performance of our cloud rendering platform remains highly cost-effective. As we continue to expand, the gradual
growth of our cloud rendering will provide opportunities to increase revenue from the sale of rendering capacities. 

 By the end of 2024, we intend to generate revenue
primarily through the sale of tariff plans for our cloud rendering services. To select the tariff plan that best fits client s requirements,
they are required to contact our team to subscribe and submit their project. This allows us to choose the right tariff plan according
to their project and the cloud rendering power needed. When estimating a project, we assess the required number of hours and capacity
necessary to fulfill the client's needs. The tariff plans may vary depending on the number of video cards used to produce power (10, 25
and 40 video cards), as well as the time needed for rendering with a minimum option of 5 hours. Clients can contact us using the information
provided in the "Contacts" section on our website (https://global-smart.tech/contacts/). After determining the project scope,
the client proceeds with the payment. Once payment is received, we deliver the completed project, following the rendering process, to
the client via the email address provided in the form. 

Our primary target customers include 3D interior designers
and visualizers in the design industry. We aim to offer a range of flexible and competitive pricing options to attract clients and maximize
revenue potential. This revenue stream will be a key driver of our financial growth and sustainability in the foreseeable future. 

Marketing 

 We are considering choosing online marketing
as our key strategy to attract the users. We will probably first invest into promotion via different social networks and search engine
optimization. This is planned to help us to appear in users search inquiries by key words. 

16 

Government Regulation 

 The Company will be required to comply with
all regulations, rules, and directives of governmental authorities including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and agencies applicable
to our business in any jurisdiction with which we would conduct activities. The Company does not believe that governmental regulations
will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. 

 As our business expands to include new uses
or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase, and we
may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. 

Employees 

 Global-Smart.Tech is a Company with only one
employee, Yehor Rodin, our President, CEO, Treasurer, Secretary, Director. The Company may consider hiring more employees if the need
arises. 

 Overview 

 The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statement as of May 31, 2024. 

 Results of Operations for the three months ended
August 31, 2024 and 2023: 

 Revenue 

 For the three months ended August 31, 2023 and 2024,
we generated no revenue. 

 Operating expenses 

 Total operating expenses for
three months ended August 31, 2024 were 27,549. The operating expenses included amortization expense of 18,549 and professional fees
of 9,000. 

 Total operating expenses for
three months ended August 31, 2023 were 13,899. The operating expenses included amortization expense of 13,899. 

 The increase in amortization
expense was a result of having more assets on hand over time and the increase in professional fees was due to the timing of auditing and
legal fees incurred for the filing of our Form S-1 registration statement. 

 Net Loss 

 Our Net Loss for three months ended August 31, 2024
was 27,549. Our Net Loss for three months ended August 31, 2023 was 13,899. 

 17 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 As of August 31, 2024, we had no current assets. In
the opinion of our management, additional funding is required to meet our development goals for the next twelve months. While there are
currently no guarantees, we expect to be able to generate revenue primarily through the sale of tariff plans for our cloud rendering services
by the end of 2024. 

We have generated revenue in amount of 14 since inception
on April 15, 2022. We will require additional funds to implement our plans. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing,
or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We will also need more funds if the operations
of our cloud rendering platform cost more than we have budgeted. Our future depends upon our ability to obtain further financing, the
successful operations of business, a successful marketing and promotion program, attraction, and, further in the future, achieving a profitable
level of operations. 

Operational Cash Flows 

 We had operating cash outflows of 9,000 for
the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 13,899 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The primary allocation of cash has been
directed towards general working capital needs, reflecting the ongoing operational requirements of the business. 

Financing Cash Flows 

 For the three months ended August 31, 2024
Mr. Rodin, CEO and sole director, advanced 9,000 under a related party loan agreement, therefore as of August 31, 2024 total advances
under the loan agreement were 414,091. For the three months ended August 31, 2023 there was no cash used in or provided by financing
activities. 

Investing Cash Flows 

 We used 0 in investing activities during three
months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. 

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive
officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of August 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 During the three months ended August 31, 2024
there were no changes in our system of internal controls over financial reporting. 

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.
