We did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carryforward period. The Company intends to file income tax returns in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and various state tax jurisdictions. The tax years for 2017 to 2023 remain open for examination by federal and/or state tax jurisdictions. The Company is currently not under examination by any other tax jurisdictions for any tax year. Going Concern at September 30, 2024 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company ), and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the June 30, 2024 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Form 10-K (File No. 000-54838; the Form 10-K ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2024. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forward-looking statements. OVERVIEW The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2009 and has established a fiscal year end of June 30. Going Concern To date the Company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. The Company has incurred a loss since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of 19,286,226 at September 30, 2024 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. The Company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through this or any other offerings. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Financial Notes. PLAN OF OPERATION Our plan of operation for the following twelve months is as follows: On July 15, 2021, we acquired the assets of Paleo Scavenger, LLC for 10,000. Paleo owns the Within / Without Granola WWG brand. The purchase price includes the WWG trademarks, brands, books, records, intellectual property, commercial sales channel, customer lists and manufacturing rights. Early in 2021, WWG ceased operations, and we restarted the manufacturing process in June 2022. We generated our first sales since inception during August 2022. We are currently selling our original and maple flavored granola products on Shopify. During February 2023, the inventory from the first run of the Within / Without Granola products expired and the remaining inventory was written off. The Company is searching for a new manufacturer to produce smaller batches of the Within / Without Granola products. As of October 11, 2024, a new manufacturer has not been engaged. We must raise at least 100,000 to commence our plan of operation, described above, and fund our ongoing operational expenses. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue our operations. Management believes that if we are successful in raising 100,000, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, if such financing is not available, we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. If we are unsuccessful in raising at least 100,000 through a private placement, we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new, development stage business to obtain. Therefore, the Company is highly dependent upon the success of an anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with little in the way of operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. If and when these funds are obtained, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing, we would be required to cease business operations and as a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment. During 2023, William Drury the Company s secretary passed away. Amber Finney the Company CEO assumed Mr. Drury s duties. Results of Operations for the Three months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Overview. Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, originally formed on September 19, 2009. We are attempting to restart the Within / Without Granola WWG brand acquired on July 15, 2021. We generated our first sales in August 2022. We generated sales of -0- for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has generated net losses of 8,692 and 5,935 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net loss of 2,757 is attributable to the factors discussed below. 11 Table of Contents Revenues. We had revenues of -0- for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We had our first sales of our original and maple flavored granola products in August 2022. During February 2023, the inventory from the first run of the Within / Without Granola products expired. The Company is searching for a new manufacturer to produce smaller batches of the Within / Without Granola products. As of October 11, 2024, a new manufacturer has not been engaged. Expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we incurred total operating expenses of 12,194 and 3,700. The increase of 6,259 was primarily attributable to an approximate 7,000 decrease in professional fees for audit, transfer agent and accounting fees offset by an approximate 1,000 decrease in other operating expenses. Other Income (Expense). Our total other income (expense) was 3,502 and -0- for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 3,502 was attributable to a 3,502 increase in other income related to the change in market value of shares issued to the estate of Mr. Drury but not yet sold (See Note 3 Related Party Transaction in the accompanying notes to the financial statements). Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balance was 1,263 and working capital deficit was 287,280 at September 30, 2024 compared to a cash balance of 1,795 and working capital deficit of 278,923 at June 30, 2024. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are expected to be approximately 50,000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to generating revenues from operations we may utilize funds from our directors, who have informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating costs, however they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us. Management believes our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. As at September 30, 2024, our total assets were 2,263 and were comprised of cash for 1,263, intellectual property for -0- (net of accumulated amortization) and trademarks for 1,000. The intellectual property and trademarks resulted from our July 15, 2021 acquisition of the Within / Without Granola brand. As at September 30, 2024, our current liabilities of 288,543 were comprised of accounts payable of 35,021, accrued liabilities for 42,856 and related party loans of 210,666. As at September 30, 2024, our stockholders deficiency was 286,280. Cash Flows from Operating Activities We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operations was 10,532 and 1,745 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows provided by financing activities were 10,000 and 15,000, respectively from cash advances from our CEO.
