 Restatement of Previously Reported 2023 Quarterly Revenue and Credit Losses 
 In connection with the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company discovered that in 2023, it had an inadequate policy associated with its revenue recognition related to the cash collection of a certain subset of its customers that had been placed on cash basis in 2023. For these customers, because the determination had been made that there was significant collection risk and the Company had no ability to estimate the collectability of the consideration it was entitled to, revenue recognition was prohibited under Accounting Standards Codification, ASC ), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers until cash was collected for the services that were provided. The Company refers to the customers in this situation as customers that have been placed on cash basis. As further discussed below, in 2023 the Company misapplied this policy in each of the first three quarters of 2023 by failing to apply (in certain cases) cash receipts to prior accounts receivable (via a credit loss recovery) and instead recognized additional revenue for the cash receipt. 
 The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers under ASC 606. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Once the Company believes that it is no longer probable of collecting substantially all of the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services transferred to the customer and as such is prohibited from recognizing revenue until it is probable that it will be entitled to all of the consideration. As such, when a customer with significant collection risk is identified, the Company fully reserves for all outstanding accounts receivable and records a credit loss for these receivables. 
 Initially, revenue for contracts that the Company assesses are not probable of collection is not recognized until the customer has paid or settled all outstanding accounts receivable balances. Collectability is reassessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. The assessment of collectability considers whether the Company may limit its exposure to credit risk through its right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent. When services are still provided to customers that have been identified with significant collection risk, the Company initially applies all payments received against the customers oldest invoices. However, if the Company continues to provide services to these customers for a significant period of time, cash collections have stabilized and other factors indicate it is appropriate, cash collections are assessed to determine if any of the on-going cash receipts should be accounted for as variable consideration under ASC 606 for on-going services instead of recovery of credit losses. To date, no material variable consideration has been recognized and after applying the corrections shown in the table below, all cash collections for these customers are reflected as recovery of credit losses. 
 Due to the inconsistency of the cash application related to the cash basis customers, and the prohibition on recognizing revenue when the Company does not believe it will receive the consideration it is entitled to, the C ompany had determined that it had improperly recognized revenue for these customers and should have instead recognized a credit loss recovery related to these cash receipts. 
 All periods presented below have been retrospectively restated to reflect the effects of the change to revenues and operating expenses. There was no impact to operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted EBITDA for any periods presented. The consolidated statement of equity is not affected by this restatement.

The Company recorded a non-cash property and equipment impairment charge of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to certain product offerings that were sunset in December 2023, which is included in asset impairment charges in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Capitalized Software 
 Capitalized website and internal-use software development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the development and enhancement of the Weedmaps platform and SaaS solutions. The Company began to capitalize these costs when preliminary development efforts were successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it was probable that the project would be completed and the software would be used as intended. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized when placed in service, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be . Costs incurred for enhancements that were expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the enhancements, generally . Product development costs include compensation and benefits for employees, including engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products, as well as maintaining and improving existing products. Product development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company amortized million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company amortized million and million, respectively. Amortization of internal-use software development costs is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
 million in goodwill. 
 In testing for goodwill impairment, the Company may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value. If it is determined that it is unlikely that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Company is not required to complete the quantitative goodwill impairment evaluation. If it is determined that the carrying value may exceed fair value when considering qualitative factors, a quantitative goodwill impairment evaluation is performed. When performing the quantitative evaluation, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded. 
 Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually on December 31. For the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with the Company s annual assessment policy, the Company opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment. As part of the Company s impairment assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation which incorporates assumptions regarding long-term growth rates, revenue and earnings projections, estimation of cash flows, discount rates and other factors. For the year ended December 31, 2023, in conducting the quantitative assessment, it was determined that the fair value of the goodwill exceeded its carrying amount by approximately , and as a result, no impairment existed as of the annual assessment date of December 31, 2023. If the Company s forecasts of cash flows or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect our

 goodwill impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances may affect the recoverability of the net assets. Such reviews may include an analysis of current results and take into consideration the undiscounted value of projected operating cash flows. The Company recorded a non-cash intangible impairment charge of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to certain product offerings that were sunset in December 2023, which is included in asset impairment charges in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. There were no intangible asset impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the Company's annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of its annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The quarterly tax provision, and estimate of the Company's annual effective tax rate, is subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in pre-tax income (or loss), revaluations of the warrant liability, changes in flow-through income not subject to tax, valuation allowances and tax law developments. 
 As a result of the Business Combination, WM Technology, Inc. became the sole managing member of WMH LLC, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, WMH LLC is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by WMH LLC is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including WM Technology, Inc. on a pro rata basis. WM Technology, Inc. is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of WMH LLC following the Business Combination. The Company is also subject to taxes in foreign jurisdictions. 
 WMH LLC will generally be required from time to time to make pro rata distributions in cash to the Company and the other holders of WMH Units at certain assumed tax rates in amounts that are intended to be sufficient to cover the taxes on the Company s and the other WMH equity holders respective allocable shares of the taxable income of WMH LLC. 
 For the three and nine ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million and million , respectively, in income tax provisions due to the impact of the full valuation allowance on its net deferred assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded in income tax provisions due to the impact of the full valuation allowance on its net deferred assets. The effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the impact of valuation allowances, warrant valuations, non-controlling interests represented by the portion of the flow-through income not subject to tax, permanent stock-based compensation and state taxes. 
 ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The Company does not believe it has any uncertain income tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to materially affect its condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Change in valuation inputs or other assumptions Fair value, end of period 
 Public Warrants 
 The Company determined the fair value of the Public Warrants, based on the publicly listed trading price of such warrants as of the valuation date. Accordingly, the Public Warrants are classified as Level 1 financial instruments. The fair value of the Public Warrants was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Private Placement Warrants 
 The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is determined with Level 3 inputs using the Black-Scholes model. The significant inputs and assumptions in this method are the stock price, exercise price, volatility, risk-free rate, and term or maturity. The underlying stock price input is the closing stock price as of each valuation date and the exercise price is the price as stated in the warrant agreement. The volatility input was determined using the historical volatility of comparable publicly traded companies which operate in a similar industry or compete directly against the Company. Volatility for each comparable publicly traded company is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of daily continuously compounded returns. The Black-Scholes analysis is performed in a risk-neutral framework, which requires a risk-free rate assumption based upon constant-maturity treasury yields, which are interpolated based on the remaining term of the Private Placement Warrants as of each valuation date. The term/maturity is the duration between each valuation date and the maturity date, which is following the date the Business Combination closed, or June 16, 2026.

 Public Warrants outstanding and Private Placement Warrants outstanding. 
 The Public Warrants entitle the holder thereof to purchase share of Class A Common Stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustments. The Public Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. The Public Warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on June 16, 2026, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Public Warrants are listed on the NYSE under the symbol MAPSW. 
 The Company may redeem the Public Warrants starting July 16, 2021, in whole and not in part, at a price of per Public Warrant, upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption to each holder of Public Warrants, and if, and only if, the reported last sales price of the Company s Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalization and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date the Company sends the notice of redemption to the holders of Public Warrants. 
 Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for share of Class A Common Stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants (including the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) are not transferable, assignable or salable until days after the completion of the Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions, and they are nonredeemable as long as they are held by Silver Spike Sponsor or its permitted transferees. Silver Spike Sponsor, as well as its permitted transferees, has the option to exercise the Private Placement Warrants on a cashless basis and will have certain registration rights related to such Private Placement Warrants. Otherwise, the Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than Silver Spike Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 
 The Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of Class A Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. 
 The Company concluded the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants, or the Warrants, meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815- Derivatives and Hedging and are recorded as liabilities. Upon the Closing, the fair value of the Warrants was recorded on the balance sheet. The fair value of the Warrants are remeasured as of each balance sheet date, which resulted in a non-cash gain of million and million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a non-cash loss of million and million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 (3) Average monthly net revenues per paying client is defined as the average monthly net revenues for any particular period divided by the average monthly paying clients in the same respective period. Average monthly net revenues per paying client is calculated in the same manner as our previously-reported average monthly revenue per paying client, and the description of the metric is being updated solely to clarify that it is calculated using net revenues. 
 (4) Average monthly paying clients are defined as the average of the number of paying clients billed in a month across a particular period (and for which services were provided). 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Our financial statements, including net income (loss), are prepared in accordance with GAAP. For more information regarding the components within our net income (loss), see Components of Our Results of Operations below. 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.3 million compared with a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 2.5 million. The change in net income was primarily due to a decrease in total costs and expenses of 10.9 million, change in fair value of warrant liability of 1.0 million, and change in tax receivable agreement TRA liability of 0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in revenue of 0.1 million and a decrease in other income (expense) of 3.5 million. 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.5 million compared with a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 4.5 million. The increase in net income was primarily due to a decrease in total costs and expenses of 20.8 million, and change in fair value of warrant liability of 1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in revenue of 4.7 million, change in tax receivable agreement TRA liability of 0.8 million and a decrease in other income (expense) of 3.2 million. 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures that we calculate as net income (loss) before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense in the case of EBITDA and further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liability, transaction related bonus, legal settlements and other legal costs, reduction in force, asset impairment charges, change in TRA liability and other non-cash, unusual and/or infrequent costs in the case of Adjusted EBITDA. Below we have provided a reconciliation of net income (loss) (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to EBITDA; and from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because these metrics are a key measure used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of investment capacity. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management.

Table of Contents 

 Each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider any of these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our other GAAP results. 
 A reconciliation of net income (loss) to non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

 Average Monthly Net Revenues Per Paying Client 
 Average monthly net revenues per paying client measures how much clients, for the period of measurement, are willing to pay us for our subscription and additional offerings and the efficiency of the bid-auction process for our featured listings placements. We calculate this metric by dividing the average monthly net revenues for any particular period by the average monthly number of paying clients in the same respective period. The increase in our average monthly net revenues per paying client was due to sunset of certain products in December 2023, which had lower average monthly spending clients.

 Average Monthly Paying Clients 
 We define average monthly paying clients as the monthly average of clients billed each month over a particular period (and for which services were provided). Our paying clients include both individual cannabis businesses as well as retail websites or businesses within a larger organization that have independent relationships with us, many of whom are owned by holding companies where decision-making is decentralized such that purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with us are located, at a lower organizational level. In addition, any client may choose to purchase multiple listing solutions for each of their retail websites or businesses.

Table of Contents 

 Average monthly paying clients for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6 to 5,100 average monthly paying clients from 5,414 average monthly paying clients in the same period in 2023. Average monthly paying clients for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 10 to 5,027 average monthly paying clients from 5,555 average monthly paying clients in the same period in 2023. The decrease in average monthly paying clients compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to the removal of paying clients from our platform who have become delinquent, the impact on client count related to the sunset of certain products in December 2023, as well as expected client churn due to continued industry challenges, such as price deflation and ongoing consolidation.

 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Growth of Our Two-Sided Weedmaps Marketplace 
 We have historically grown through and intend to focus on continuing to grow through the expansion of our two-sided marketplace, which occurs through growth of the number and type of businesses and consumers that we attract to our platform. We believe that expansion of the number and types of cannabis businesses that choose to list on our platform will continue to make our platform more compelling for consumers and drive traffic and consumer engagement, which in turn will make our platform more valuable to cannabis businesses. 
 Growth and Retention of Our Paying Clients 
 Our revenue grows primarily through acquiring and retaining paying clients and increasing the revenue per paying client over time. We have a history of attracting new paying clients and increasing their annual spend with us over time, primarily due to the value they receive once they are onboarded and able to take advantage of the benefits of participating in our two-sided marketplace and leveraging our software solutions. 
 Prices of certain commodity products, including gas prices, are historically volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, trade restrictions and tariffs, inflation, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the recent state of war between Israel and Hamas and the related risk of a larger regional conflict. Increasing prices in the component materials for the goods or services of our clients may impact their ability to maintain or increase their spend with us and their ability to pay their invoices on time. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may negatively affect our revenue if our clients are unable to mitigate inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. This could also negatively impact our net dollar retention and our collections on accounts receivable. 
 Regulation and Maturation of Cannabis Markets 
 We believe that we will have significant opportunities for greater growth as more jurisdictions legalize cannabis for medical and/or adult-use and the regulatory environment continues to develop. Currently , thirty-nine states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana have legalized some form of cannabis use for certain medical purpose s. Twenty-four of those states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Northern Mariana have legalized cannabis for adults for non-medical purposes as well (sometimes referred to as adult or recreational use). Eight additional states have legalized forms of low-potency cannabis, for select medical conditions. Only three states continue to prohibit cannabis entirely. We intend to explore new expansion opportunities as additional jurisdictions legalize cannabis for medical or adult use and leverage our business model informed by our 15-year operating history to enter new markets. 
 We also have a significant opportunity to monetize transactions originating from users engaging with a retailer on the Weedmaps marketplace or tracked via one of our Weedmaps for Business solutions. Given U.S. federal prohibitions on plant-touching businesses and our current policy not to participate in the chain of commerce associated with the sale of cannabis products, we do not charge take-rates or payment fees for transactions originating from users who engage with a retailer on the Weedmaps platform or tracked via one of our Weedmaps for Business solutions. A change in U.S. federal regulations could result in our ability to engage in such monetization efforts without adverse consequences to our business. A change in U.S. federal regulations could also increase access to capital and remove limitations of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, thus allowing deduction or credit for certain expenses of cannabis business to increase our cash flow and liquidity, as well as those of many industry participants. 
 Our long-term growth depends on our ability to successfully capitalize on new and existing cannabis markets. Each market must reach a critical mass of both cannabis businesses and consumers for listing subscriptions, advertising placements and other 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 solutions to have meaningful appeal to potential clients. As regulated markets mature and as we incur expenses to attract paying clients and convert non-paying clients to paying clients, we may generate losses in new markets for an extended period. 
 Furthermore, we compete with cannabis-focused and general two-sided marketplaces, internet search engines and various other newspaper, television and media companies and other software providers. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the regulatory regime for cannabis becomes more settled and the legal market for cannabis becomes more accepted, which may encourage new participants to enter the market, including established companies with substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than existing market participants. Our current and future competitors may also enjoy other competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, more offerings and larger marketing budgets. 
 Brand Recognition and Reputation 
 We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity and our reputation is critical to maintaining and growing our relationships with clients and consumers and to our ability to attract new clients and consumers. Historically, a substantial majority of our marketing spending was on out-of-home advertising on billboards, buses and other non-digital outlets. Starting in 2019, consistent with the overall shift in perceptions regarding cannabis, a number of demand-side digital advertising platforms allowed us to advertise online. We also invested in growing our internal digital performance advertising team. We believe there is an opportunity to improve market efficiency through digital channels and expect to shift our marketing spending accordingly. Over the longer term, we expect to shift and accelerate our marketing spend to additional online and traditional channels, such as broadcast television or radio, as they become available to us. Further, we have begun reinvesting in our own on-the-ground and field marketing presence and are increasing the types and cadence of client events. These events and in-store activations allow Weedmaps to engage with consumers at the point of purchase and also afford Weedmaps with the opportunity to engage directly with our clients, understand their needs and challenges and foster goodwill. 
 Negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, clients or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Given our high visibility and relatively long operating history compared to many of our competitors, we may be more susceptible to the risk of negative publicity. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful. 
 We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in our market continues to develop. If our brand promotion activities are not successful, our operating results and growth may be adversely impacted. 
 Investments in Growth 
 We intend to continue to make focused organic and inorganic investments to grow our revenue and scale operations to support that growth. 
 Given our long operating history in the United States and the strength of our network, often businesses will initially list on our platform without targeted sales or marketing efforts by us. However, we plan to accelerate our investments in marketing to maintain and increase our brand awareness through both online and offline channels. We also plan to invest in expanding our business listings thereby enhancing our client and consumer experience and improving the depth and quality of information provided on our platform. We also intend to continue to invest in several areas to continue enhancing the functionality of our Weedmaps for Business offering. We expect significant near-term investments to enhance our data assets and evolve our current listings and software offerings to our brand clients, among other areas. We anticipate undertaking such investments in order to be positioned to capitalize on the rapidly expanding cannabis market. 
 As operating expenses and capital expenditures fluctuate over time, we may accordingly experience short-term, negative impacts to our operating results and cash flows. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Net revenues 
 Our revenues are derived primarily from monthly subscriptions to Weedmaps for Bu siness, featured and deal listings, other ad solutions and WM Dispatch. Our Weedmaps for Business subscriptions generally have one-month terms that autom atically renew unless notice of cancellation is provided in advance. Featured and deal listings and other ad solutions are offered as add-on products to the Weedmaps for Business subscriptions. Featured and deal listings provide customers with premium placement ad solutions and discount and promotion pricing tools. Other ad solutions include banner ads and promotion tiles on the Company s marketplace ad as well as other advertising products on and off the Weedmaps marketplace. We have a fixed inventory of featured listing and display advertising in each market, and price is generally determined through a competitive auction process that reflects local market demand. Revenues for these arrangements are recognized over-time, generally during 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 a month-to-month subscription period as the products are provided. We rarely need to allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations. In the rare case that allocation of the transaction price is needed, we recognize revenue in proportion to the standalone selling prices of the underlying services at contract inception. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to selling and marketing, product development, general and administrative functions and depreciation and amortization. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. 
 Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization expense and primarily consists of web hosting, internet service and credit card processing costs. Cost of revenues is primarily driven by fluctuations in revenue leading to increases or decreases in credit card processing and web hosting cost. We expect our cost of revenue to continue to increase on an a bsolute basis and remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as we scale our business and inventory costs related to multi-media offerings. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expense and incentive compensation for our sales and marketing employees. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include customer acquisition marketing, events cost and branding and advertising costs. Over the longer term, we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in a manner consistent with revenue growth, however, we may experience fluctuations in some periods as we enter and develop new markets or have large one-time marketing projects. 
 Product Development Expenses 
 Product development costs consist of salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees, including engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products, as well as maintaining and improving existing products. Product development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Amortization expense related to capitalized software development cost is included in depreciation, amortization and asset impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important for our growth and expect our product development expenses will increase in a manner consistent with revenue growth as our operations grow. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll, benefit costs and stock-based compensation expense for our employees involved in general corporate functions including our senior leadership team as well as costs associated with the use by these functions of software and facilities and equipment, such as rent, insurance and other occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses also include provision (recovery) for credit losses and professional and outside services related to legal and other consulting services. General and administrative expenses are primarily driven by headcount required to support our business and meet our obligations as a public company. We expect general and administrative expenses to decline as percentage of revenue as we scale our business and leverage investments in these areas. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, capitalized software development costs and amortization of intangibles. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses to increase on an absolute basis for the foreseeable future as we scale our business. 
 Asset Impairment Charges 
 Asset impairment charges primarily consist of impairment of ROU assets related to our operating leases, impairment of intangible assets, impairment of equity securities and impairment of property and equipment. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of change in fair value of warrant liability, TRA liability remeasurement, discharge of a holdback obligation related to a prior acquisition, interest income and other tax related expenses. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to the expected future tax consequences arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 temporary differences are expected to reverse. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or laws are included in income tax expense in the period of enactment. A valuation allowance is recognized if we determine it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be recognized. In making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.

 Net revenues decreased by 0.1 million or less than 0.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from our Featured Listing and WM Deal products of 2.7 million driven by our clients continuing to face constrained marketing budgets, the ongoing consolidation of our industry, partially offset by an increase in net revenues from our Weedmaps for Business and other SaaS solutions of 2.7 million driven by favorable pricing changes partially offset by a loss in revenue from products that were sunset in December 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Featured Listing and WM Deal products, Weedmaps for Business and other ad solutions represented approximately 63 , 29 and 8 of our total net revenues, respectively.

 Cost of Revenues 
 The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily related to a decrease of 0.6 million for cost of revenues associated with multi-channel marketing and cloud communication platforms, primarily due to the sunset in December 2023 of WM CRM, WM Screens and WM AdSuite and a decrease of 0.2 million in server costs. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to decreases in personnel-related costs of 0.4 million, decrease in advertising expense of 1.2 million and a decrease in event expense of 0.3 million. The decrease in personnel-related costs was primarily driven by lower headcount resulting in decreases in salaries and wages of 0.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of 0.2 million and payroll tax expense of 0.1 million, partially offset by increases in bonus and commission expense of 0.3 million. 
 Product Development Expenses 
 The increase in product development expenses was primarily due to an increase in contracted outside services expense of 0.6 million and an increase in personnel-related costs of 1.1 million. The increase in personnel-related costs was primarily due to increases in salaries and bonus expense of 1.1 million driven by lower capitalized software development costs compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in an increase in net salaries and wages expense. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages of 0.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of 0.5 million, employee benefits of 0.2 million, rent expense of 0.5 million due to lease modification and termination, professional legal and audit services of 0.4 million, facilities expense of 0.8 million, software expense of 0.3 million, and insurance expense of 0.3 million, partially offset by increases in bonus expense of 0.5 million, outside service expense of 0.2 million, office expense of 0.5 million and provision for credit losses of 0.1 million, payroll tax of 0.1 million and severance of 0.1 million. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software amortization, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. 
 Asset Impairment Charges 
 The decrease in asset impairment charges was primarily due to 8.3 million in impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment associated with the sunset of certain product offerings in December 2023.

 1. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the restatement of previously reported credit losses. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further information. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily related to a decrease of 2.3 million for cost of revenues associated with multi-channel marketing and cloud communication platforms primarily due to the sunset in December 2023 of WM CRM, WM Screens and WM AdSuite and a decrease of 0.7 million in server costs. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs of 5.6 million, a decrease in outside services of 0.4 million and a decrease in advertising expense of 0.7 million, partially offset by an increase in event expense of 0.2 million and an increase in print and products expense of 0.7 million. The decrease in personnel-related costs was primarily driven by lower headcount resulting in decreases in salaries and wages of 2.5 million, bonus expense of 1.8 million, payroll taxes of 0.3 million and 1.0 million in stock-based compensation expense. 
 Product Development Expenses 
 The increase in product development expenses was due to an increase in outside service expense of 1.8 million and an increase in travel and entertainment expense of 0.1 million partially offset by a decrease in personnel-related costs of 1.4 million. The decrease in personnel-related costs was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages of 1.0 million, driven by a decline in headcount, partially offset by lower capitalized software development costs compared to the same period in 2023 and stock-based compensation expense of 0.4 million. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs of 3.0 million, a decrease in facilities expense of 1.7 million, a decrease in insurance expense of 1.4 million, a decrease in rent expense of 0.8 million, a decrease in software expense of 0.9 million and a decrease in provision for credit losses of 0.1 million, partially offset by 1.5 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2024 related to potential settlement of an SEC matter, increases in professional legal and audit services of 0.5 million, an increase in office expense of 0.5 million, an increase in promotional expense of 0.2 million and an increase in outside service expense of 0.9 million. 
 The decrease in personnel-related costs was primarily driven by lower headcount resulting into a decrease in salaries and wages of 1.2 million, a decrease in severance costs of 0.5 million, a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 1.8 million, a decrease in employee benefit expense of 0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in bonus expense of 0.8 million and an increase in payroll tax expense of 0.1 million. See Note 4, Commitments and Contingencies to these condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the potential settlement of an SEC matter. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software amortization, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. 
 Asset Impairment Charges 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in asset impairment charges was primarily due to 8.3 million in impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment associated with the sunset of certain product offerings in December 2023.

 Seasonality 
 The cannabis industry has certain industry holidays that in recent years have resulted in increased purchases by cannabis consumers. Such holidays include, but are not limited to 420, July 10 th and the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Green Wednesday ). Likewise, our clients will typically increase their spend heading into these events. We also typically invest in marketing spend around these holidays which can create some seasonality in our sales and market expenses from quarter to quarter. While seasonality has not had a significant impact on our results in the past, our clients may experience seasonality in their businesses which in turn can impact the revenue generated from them. Our business may become more seasonal in the future and historical patterns in our business may not be a reliable indicator of future performance. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following tables show our cash, accounts receivable and working capital as of the dates indicated:

 Cash 45,043 34,350 Accounts receivable, net 7,907 11,158 Working capital 31,577 17,771 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 45.0 million and 34.4 million, respectively. Our funds are being used for funding our current operations and potential strategic acquisitions in the future. We also intend to increase our capital expenditures to support the organic growth in our business and operations. We expect to fund our liquidity requirements from cash and working capital on hand at September 30, 2024, as well as from cash provided by operating activities. We believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on

 many factors. We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We primarily finance our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows generated by operations. To the extent existing cash and investments and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders. We may enter into investment or acquisition transactions in the future, which could require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 27,275 12,410 Net cash used in investing activities (9,499) (8,870) Net cash used in financing activities (7,083) (4,402) 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash from operating activities consists primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of warrant liability, change in TRA liability, amortization of right-of-use lease assets, stock-based compensation, asset impairment charges, gain on lease termination, provision (recovery) for credit losses and the effect of changes in working capital. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.3 million, which resulted from a net income of 8.5 million, together with net cash outflows of 2.2 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, and non-cash items of 21.0 million, consisting of depreciation and amortization of 9.6 million, change in TRA liability of 1.5 million, amortization of right-of-use lease assets of 3.3 million, stock-based compensation of 7.2 million, partially offset by change in fair value of warrant liability of 0.2 million, gain on lease termination of 0.1 million and provision (recovery) for credit losses of 0.3 million. Net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 0.4 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1.2 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of 0.2 million and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 5.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 3.5 million and a decrease in other assets of 1.0 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities are mostly due to fluctuations in timing of cash receipts and payments. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 12.4 million, which resulted from net loss of 4.5 million, together with net cash outflows of 12.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, and non-cash items of 29.4 million, consisting of depreciation and amortization of 9.4 million, fair value of warrant liability of 0.8 million, change in TRA liability of 0.7 million, amortization of right-of-use lease assets of 3.7 million, asset impairment charges of 8.4 million and stock-based compensation of 10.4 million, partially offset by gain from the discharge of a holdback obligation related to a prior acquisition of 3.7 million and provision (recovery) for credit losses of 0.2 million. Net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a decrease in accounts payables and accrued expenses of 15.4 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 4.7 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of 0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivables of 5.3 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 2.4 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities are mostly due to fluctuations in timing of cash receipts and payments. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.5 million, which resulted from 9.5 million cash paid for capital expenditures which includes purchases of property and equipment, including certain capitalized software development cost. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.9 million, which resulted from 8.9 million cash paid for capital expenditures which includes purchases of property and equipment, including certain capitalized software development cost.

 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash outflows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.1 million, which primarily consists of 7.3 million in distributions payments to members of WMH LLC, 0.1 million in TRA payments and 0.3 million in proceeds from collection of related party note receivable. 
 Net cash outflows from financing activities for nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 4.4 million, which primarily consists of 1.5 million in repayments of insurance premium financing and 3.2 million in distributions payments to members of WMH LLC and 0.3 million in proceeds from collection of related party note receivable. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company had no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in Part I. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Assets and liabilities acquired from acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The accounting for goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant judgement, estimates and assumptions. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing acquired intangible assets and liabilities include projected cash flows attributable to the assets or liabilities, asset useful lives and discount rates. 
 Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to annual impairment testing, or between annual tests if an event or change in circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually on December 31. For the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with our annual assessment policy, we opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment. As part of our impairment assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation which incorporates assumptions regarding long-term growth rates, revenue and earnings projections, estimation of cash flows, discount rates and other factors. Changes in these inputs could materially affect the results of our impairment review. In conducting our quantitative assessment, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill substantially exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 18 , and as a result, no impairment existed as of the annual assessment date of December 31, 2023. If our forecasts of cash flows or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect our operating results. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Intangible assets deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, where the useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly, or indirectly, to our future cash flows. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. For amortizable intangible assets, impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. At least annually, the remaining useful life is evaluated. We recorded an impairment charge of 6.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to intangible assets associated with certain product offerings that were sunset in December 2023, which is included in asset impairment charges in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. There were no goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Intangible Assets, to these condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 We have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, such standards will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our current operations.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 With the foregoing in mind, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer Certifying Officers evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weaknesses 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the following entity-level material weaknesses have been identified: We did not fully maintain components of the COSO framework, including elements of the control environment, risk assessment, information and communication and monitoring activities components, relating to (i) developing general control activities over technology to support the achievement of objectives across the entity, (ii) sufficiency 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 of processes related to identifying and analyzing risks to the achievement of objectives, including technology, across the entity, and (iii) sufficiency of selecting and developing control activities that contribute to the mitigation of risks to the achievement of objectives to acceptable levels. 
 The entity-level material weaknesses contributed to other material weaknesses within our system of internal control over financial reporting as follow: 
 We did not design and maintain effective information technology (IT) general controls for certain information systems supporting our key financial reporting processes. Specifically, we did not design, implement and maintain (a) change management controls to ensure that program and data changes affecting financial applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately, (b) access controls to ensure appropriate IT segregation of duties are maintained that adequately restrict and segregate privileged access between environments which support development and production, and (c) controls to monitor on an on-going basis for the proper segregation of privileged access between environments which support development and production. As a result, IT application controls and business process controls that are dependent on the ineffective IT general controls, or that rely on data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective IT general controls, are also deemed ineffective, which affects substantially all of our financial statement account balances and disclosures. 
 We did not design and maintain effective information technology (IT) general controls for certain information systems supporting our key financial reporting processes. Specifically, we did not design, implement and maintain sufficient change management, security, and operations controls for certain in-scope on-premise applications and vendor-supported applications. 
 We did not design and maintain effective process-level controls related to the order-to-cash cycle (including revenues, accounts receivables, and deferred revenue), procure-to-pay-cycle (including operating expenses, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses), capitalized software, and long-term assets. The material weakness related to the order-to-cash cycle resulted in an inadequate policy associated with our revenue recognition policies related to the cash collection of a certain subset of our customers that had been placed on a cash basis and, in turn, the restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in our prior three quarters reported in 2023 as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, six months ended June 30, 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the corresponding periods. Additionally, this material weakness could result in a misstatement of any account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective IT general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support our financial reporting processes. We took measures to remediate this material weakness, specifically by undertaking the following measures: 
 removing developers administrative access from production systems; 
 removing the ability for certain users, including developers, to access other users accounts; and 
 implementing audit trails to log and monitor system configuration and data changes made by users to detect erroneous or unauthorized changes. 
 Our remediation efforts concluded as of June 30, 2023 when we determined that the above measures had been implemented. As of July 2023, administrative access to the sandbox environment where development activities take place was extended to users with administrative access to the production environment, thereby negating the remediation efforts taken. This access was not subject to our monthly monitoring control activity and persisted through the remainder of fiscal 2023. The lack of successful completion of our remediation efforts related to this material weakness identified for the year ended December 31, 2022 is reflected in the first bullet of our 2023 material weaknesses discussed above. 
 Remediation 
 We have begun the process of and are focused on designing and implementing effective internal controls to improve our internal controls over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness, including; 
 the recruitment of additional personnel with extensive knowledge of GAAP, 
 implementation of a new ERP system, 
 strengthening IT governance and designing IT general controls including program change management, accessing and restricting user access to our internal systems used for financial reporting and accessing. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Until the remediation plan is fully implemented, tested, and deemed effective we cannot assure that our actions will adequately remediate the material weaknesses or that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls will not be identified in the future. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC, could be adversely affected and could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The information set forth under "Commitments and Contingencies Litigation" in Note 4 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. 
 On October 17, 2024, a putative shareholder class action complaint, captioned Seret Ishak v. WM Technology, Inc. et al. , No. 2:24-cv-08959, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, naming us and certain former and current officers and/or directors of the Company and Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. Silver Spike as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact relating to historical public reporting of MAUs in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The putative class action is brought on behalf of persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between May 25, 2021, and September 24, 2024, inclusive, and seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney s fees. 
 At this early stage of the proceedings, we are unable to make any prediction regarding the outcome of the litigation. 
 As previously disclosed, in the second quarter of 2022, our board of directors received an internal complaint regarding the calculation, definition and reporting of our monthly active users MAUs metric. In response, our board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel. As a result of the findings of that internal investigation, we provided certain additional information regarding the growth and nature of our previously-reported MAUs in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on August 9, 2022. This investigation found no impact on our financial results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP or the reporting or disclosure of any currently disclosed non-GAAP financial metric. As also previously reported, in the third quarter of 2022, we determined not to report MAUs going forward. In August 2022, our board of directors determined to voluntarily report the internal complaint and subsequent internal investigation to the SEC, following which the SEC s Division of Enforcement commenced an investigation. We have been fully cooperating with that investigation. 
 As also previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 25, 2024, on July 22, 2024, we reached an agreement in principle with the SEC staff to resolve the SEC investigation with respect to the Company. Under the terms of the settlement, we consented, without admitting or denying the SEC s findings, to the entry of an administrative cease-and-desist order finding violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Sections 13(a), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder, and to pay a civil money penalty of 1.5 million. The settlement was approved by the SEC, and the administrative cease-and-desist order was entered in September 2024. We issued payment to the SEC, and it was received by the SEC, in October 2024. Accordingly, the SEC enforcement matter is concluded with respect to the Company. 
 Further, on November 8, 2024, a shareholder derivative action, captioned DeGennaro v. Francis, et. al, Case No. 8:24-cv-02454 was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against certain members of our Board of Directors and certain former and current officers. The plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively on behalf of the Company, and the Company is a nominal defendant in the action. The derivative complaint alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants authorized or permitted materially false statements and/or material omissions of fact relating to historical public reporting of MAUs. The derivative complaint asserts claims for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act as well as claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. The derivative complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the Company, disgorgement or restitution, corporate governance reforms, declaratory relief, and an award of costs and expenses to the derivative plaintiff, including attorneys fees. 
 Additionally, from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in th e ordinary course of business. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, to our knowledge we are not currently party to any legal proceedings which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. We also pursue litigation to protect our legal rights and additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property and our contractual rights, to protect our confidential information or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investment in our securities involves risk. An investor or potential investor should consider the risks summarized below and under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our 2023 Form 10-K and of Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (our Prior 10-Q when

 making investment decisions regarding our securities. Except for the risk factors discussed below, we do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K and Prior 10-Q. 
 Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business. 
 From time to time, we may be party to various claims and legal proceedings. For example, in August 2022, our board of directors determined to voluntarily report an internal complaint and subsequent internal investigation to the SEC. Since that date, we have responded to subpoenas from the SEC s Division of Enforcement and on July 22, 2024, we reached an agreement in principle with the SEC staff to resolve the SEC staff s investigation with respect to the Company. The settlement was approved by the SEC, and the administrative cease-and-desist order was entered in September 2024. In addition, on October 17, 2024, a putative shareholder class action complaint, captioned Seret Ishak v. WM Technology, Inc. et al., No. 2:24-cv-08959, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, naming us and certain former and current officers and/or directors of the Company and Silver Spike as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact relating to historical public reporting of MAUs. In addition, on November 8, 2024, a shareholder derivative action, captioned DeGennaro v. Francis, et. al, Case No. 8:24-cv-02454, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against certain members of our Board of Directors and certain former and current officers. The derivative complaint alleges that the individual defendants authorized or permitted materially false statements and/or material omissions of fact relating to historical public reporting of MAUs. See Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, titled Legal Proceedings for more information regarding this litigation. 
 Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, penalties and other sanctions, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm and other factors. 
 Even when not merited, the defense of any lawsuits or legal proceedings, including potential securities litigation, is expensive and may divert management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending any lawsuits or legal proceedings. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could negatively impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. We evaluate all claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if probable and estimable, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. 
 Furthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery. In addition, any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. 
 We currently do not meet, and may not regain compliance with, the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq ), and as a result our Class A Common Stock may be delisted. Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could decrease. 
 Our Class A Common Stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which has minimum requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed. These requirements include maintaining a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, which closing bid price cannot fall below 1.00 per share for a period of more than 30 consecutive business days 
 On October 9, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive trading days, the closing bid price for our Class A Common Stock was below 1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing bid price required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the Notice ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we are provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until April 7, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement. If at any time during the 180 calendar day grace period, the closing bid price of our Class A Common Stock is at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (unless the Nasdaq staff exercises its discretion to extend this ten business day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H)), Nasdaq will provide us written confirmation of compliance, and the matter will be closed. 
 If we do not regain compliance during the compliance period, we may be provided a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance if we apply to transfer the listing of our Class A Common Stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market. To qualify, we must meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market (with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement), based on our most recent public filings and

 market information and notify Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance periods, including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, our Class A Common Stock will be subject to delisting. We would have the right to appeal a determination to delist our Class A Common Stock, and our Class A Common Stock would remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market until the completion of the appeal process. 
 There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the 180-day compliance period, secure a second 180-day period to regain compliance, or maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements. 
 Additionally, if a reverse stock split is implemented, there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our Class A Common Stock following the reverse stock split will remain unchanged or will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. The liquidity of the shares of our Class A Common Stock may be affected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of our Class A Common Stock that will be outstanding following such reverse stock split. Furthermore, following any reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our Class A Common Stock may not attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. 
 In the event that our Class A Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq as a result of our failure to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement, as a result of Nasdaq not granting us an extension or the panel not granting us a favorable decision or due to our failure to continue to comply with any other requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, trading of our Class A Common Stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board, but there can be no assurance that our Class A Common Stock will be eligible for trading on such alternative exchange or market. 
 Additionally, if our Class A Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock would be adversely affected, the market price of our Class A Common Stock could decrease, our ability to obtain sufficient additional capital to fund our operations and transactions in our Class A Common Stock could lose federal preemption of state securities laws. Furthermore, there could also be a further reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media and broker-dealers may be deterred from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our Class A Common Stock, which could cause the price of our Class A Common Stock to decline further. Moreover, delisting may also negatively affect our clients , customers and employees confidence in us and employee morale.

The Notice is a notice of deficiency, not delisting, and has no immediate effect on the listing of our Class A Common Stock, and our Class A Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MAPS at this time, subject to our with the other Nasdaq listing requirements. 
 In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we are provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until April 7, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement. If at any time during the 180-calendar day grace period, the closing bid price of our Class A Common Stock is at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (unless the Nasdaq staff exercises its discretion to extend this ten business day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H)), Nasdaq will provide us written confirmation of compliance, and the matter will be closed. 
 If we do not regain compliance during the compliance period, we may be provided a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance if we apply to transfer the listing of our Class A Common Stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market.
