financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management expects
revenue growth to continue over the next twelve months. In the event that revenue is not available to cover all expenses, the Company
intends to finance operating costs with loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

In General 

Tofla Megaline Inc. Tofla 
or we or "the Company") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 31, 2018. As a development stage company
specializing in software for robotic devices, we provide cutting-edge AI solutions that enhance security and efficiency. Our focus is
on developing easy-to-use, high-quality, and cost-effective automation solutions for both standalone and integrated applications. Our
key feature is developing software for security purposes. We offer a comprehensive suite of software products designed to improve the
capabilities of robotic units in surveillance, patrol, and navigation. Our solutions include advanced algorithms for real-time threat
detection, intelligent software for precise route planning and management, and predictive maintenance capabilities to minimize downtime
and reduce costs. Beyond our software offerings, we also provide comprehensive consulting and technical support services. 

Our solutions can be integrated
with established control equipment and security systems, or used as independent versions. Our current projects involve software integration
with security and video surveillance systems, along with the development of customizable solutions that support long-distance navigation,
and task completion. 

Our technology integrates
a modular system of specialized devices for data collection, advanced AI for real-time threat analysis, and sophisticated software for
seamless integration and control. The modular system offers flexibility and scalability, allowing for easy updates, troubleshooting, and
customization to meet diverse security requirements. AI processes collected data in real-time, detecting potential threats and initiating
appropriate responses. Our software coordinates the various components, ensuring smooth communication and operation between the modular
devices, AI algorithms, and other system elements. 

By harnessing the power of
our modular system, AI capabilities, and innovative software, we are redefining the future of security technology and delivering unparalleled
protection to our clients. 

Principal Products and Services 

Tofla s primary business
includes developing AI-powered software for robotic security systems. We offer a range of software products designed to enhance the
capabilities of these robotic units, including: 

Threat Detection Software: This software utilizes advanced
algorithms to analyze video footage in real time, identifying potential security threats such as unauthorized access, suspicious
activities, and other violations. 

 Route Optimization Software: Designed to optimize patrol
routes for robotic units, ensuring efficient coverage of designated areas and minimizing redundant movements. 

 Predictive Maintenance Software: This software leverages
AI to predict potential maintenance issues based on usage patterns and sensor data, allowing for proactive interventions and minimizing
downtime. 

 Integration Software: Our solutions can be seamlessly
integrated with existing security systems and control equipment, providing a unified and comprehensive security solution. 

15 

These software products collectively
enable robotic security systems to perform their duties more effectively, efficiently, and proactively, enhancing overall security
and reducing the burden on human personnel. 

Our Company is at the forefront
of robotic security software development, leveraging years of investment in AI, autonomy, and efficiency. We offer a comprehensive
suite of solutions designed to enhance the capabilities of robotic units in surveillance, patrol, and threat detection. Our
software is tailored to meet the specific needs of both individual users and businesses seeking to improve their security posture. We
are committed to providing personalized support and ensuring the highest standards of performance and reliability. 

Marketing Plans 

To enhance our market presence and drive growth, we
will implement a comprehensive marketing strategy encompassing digital marketing, partnerships, and customer relationship management. Our
digital marketing efforts will focus on SEO, PPC advertising, and email marketing to increase online visibility and generate leads. 
To foster customer loyalty and provide exceptional service, we will implement a robust CRM system and prioritize customer satisfaction. By
effectively executing these marketing strategies, we aim to position our Company as a leading player in the security software market and
achieve our business goals. 

Competition 

The software development market is highly competitive, with
a large number of companies operating in the space. Entry barriers are relatively low, leading to intense competition. To
differentiate ourselves, we will focus on providing tailored solutions that address the specific needs of each client. 

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend
to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may
not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs, a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease
operations.

Employees. 

Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo acts as Chief Executive Officer,
President, Treasurer and Secretary of Board of Directors. On August 30, 2024, Marquez Hernandez was appointed as independent director
