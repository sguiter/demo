On
October 30, 2023 during the Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders approved an amendment to the company s Amended and
Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date up to six (6) months which the company must consummate a business
combination to August 5, 2024. 

On
August 6, 2024, the Company filed the preliminary proxy statements to SEC, which had proposed to amend the memorandum and articles of
association of the Company to extend the date of consummate a business combination to April 5, 2025. For further information reference
to the Note 9. 

The
Trust Account 

As
of April 5, 2022, a total of of the net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement transaction completed with the Sponsor,
was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders with Wilmington Trust, National
Association acting as trustee. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and held in the Wilmington Trust account, respectively. 

The
funds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act and that invest solely in United States government treasuries. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust
Account that may be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the Trust
Account until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the Company s liquidation. 

Merger
Agreement 

On
April 12, 2023, Metal Sky entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Future Dao Group Holding
Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the Future Dao ), and Future Dao League Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company
and wholly owned subsidiary of Future Dao (the Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Metal Sky (the First Merger ), with Metal Sky surviving
the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Future Dao, and (ii) Metal Sky will merge with and into Future Dao (the Second
Merger and together with the First Merger, the Mergers ), with Future Dao surviving the Second Merger (the Second
Business Combination ). million
for all of the outstanding Future Dao Ordinary Shares, each Future Dao Ordinary Share will have a value of per share after giving
effect to such share split (the Share Split ). The Business Combination has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors
of both Metal Sky and Future Dao pursuant to a written resolution . 

On
October 6, 2023, the parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Termination of Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Termination
Agreement ), pursuant to which, among other things, the parties agreed to mutually terminate the Merger Agreement, pursuant to
Section 10.01 (a) of the Merger Agreement, effective as of October 6, 2023 (the Termination ). 

As
a result of the Termination, the Merger Agreement will be of no further force and effect except as provided in Section 10.02 of the Merger
Agreement, and the Transaction Agreements (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will either be terminated in accordance with their terms
or be of no further force and effect. Neither party will be required to pay the other any fees or expenses as a result of the Termination.
Metal Sky, Future Dao and Merger Sub have also agreed on behalf of themselves and their respective related parties, to a release of claims
relating to the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement. 

Liquidity 

On
April 5, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of units (including the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters
in the IPO) at per unit (the Public Units ), generating gross proceeds of . Each Unit consists of one
ordinary share, one redeemable warrant to purchase one ordinary share (each a Warrant , and, collectively, the Warrants ),
and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share upon the consummation of a Business Combination. 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the Company sold to its Sponsor units at per unit in a private placement generating
total gross proceeds of which is described in Note 4. 

Offering
costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees, and of
other offering costs. Except for of subscription of ordinary shares (as defined in Note 5), the Company received net proceeds
of from the IPO and the private placement. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had nil of cash held in escrow, and of working deficit,
respectively. 

In
September 2021, the Company repurchased of founder shares for . In September 2021, the Company issued of founder
shares for which include an aggregate of up to ordinary shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that
the underwriter s over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will collectively own of the Company s
issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the IPO. On April 5, 2022, the underwriter exercised the over-allotment option in full,
accordingly, no Founder Shares are subject to forfeiture. 

Going
Concern and Management Liquidity Plan 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had nil in cash and working capital deficit of . 

The
Company s liquidity needs up to the closing of the IPO on April 5, 2022 had been satisfied through proceeds from notes payable
and advances from related party and from the issuance of ordinary shares. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor
or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company with working capital. The
Company s management plans to continue its efforts to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period after the closing
of the Initial Public Offering. 

If
our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination
are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business
combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain other financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated
to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would
only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. 

If
we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease
operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may
need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

The
Company has filed a preliminary proxy statement to amend its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, extending the
deadline for consummating a business combination to April 5, 2025. The Company will have approximately 6 months to consummate a business
combination as of September 30, 2024. 

It
is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by
this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification
(the ASC issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ), in Topic 205-40, Presentation
of Financial Statements Going Concern, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination
not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance of the financial statements. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest earned from the Trust account amounted to and , which
 and was reinvested in the Trust Account. and was also recognized as unrealized gain on investments
held in the Trust account during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

31, 2023 and amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could
result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

On
August 16, 2022, the U.S. Government enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act. The main provisions of
the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA) that we anticipate may impact us is a excise tax on share repurchases. Any redemption or other
repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject
to the excise tax. Because there is possibility that the Company may acquire a U.S. domestic corporation or engage in a transaction in
which a domestic corporation becomes parent or affiliate to the Company and the Company may become a covered corporation 
as a listed Company in Nasdaq. On July 13, 2023, public shares were rendered for redemption in connection with an extension
vote (see Note 1). The management team has evaluated the IRA as of September 30, 2024, and does not accrue any excise tax related to
the redemption as the Company believes it is not a covered corporation under Internal Revenue Code Section 4501. The management
team will continue to evaluate its impact. 

The
provision for income taxes was deemed to be immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net income per ordinary

and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination

Professional
Fees 

The
Company has paid professional fees of upon initial filing with the SEC of the registration statement for the public offering,
and at the closing of the public offering as of April 5, 2022. The Company dismissed the prior legal counsel in February 2024, and engaged the new legal counsel
with per month for SEC compliance. For the three months ended as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 
and in fees for these services, respectively. For the nine months ended as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred

On
April 12, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Future Dao Group Holding
Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and its subsidiary (the Future Dao ). On October 6, 2023, the Merger Agreement
been terminated. Due to this activity, the Company incurred professional fees with amounts of approximately during the fiscal
year 2023. 

Contingencies
and Dismissal of the Then-Legal Counsel 

The
Company may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no legal or administrative proceedings for which a loss was probable
and expected to be material to the financial statements. 

On
February 5, 2024, management and the Sponsor decided to dismiss the Company s then-legal counsel and terminated its services of
maintaining and managing the escrow account. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received invoices with the total amounts
of for services related to the Merger Agreement and Initial Business Combination from the then-legal counsel. All received invoices
were paid until the termination of services, which coincides with the termination of Merger Agreement. The Company did not have an executed
engagement letter with the then-legal counsel. Management estimates the maximum service fees for the Initial Business Combination would
be based on other executed service agreements with the same then-legal counsel. We believe that we have a potential liability
of for potential unbilled service fees resulting from the termination of Merger Agreement, which represents a loss contingency
to the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recorded the potential amounts in the financial statements, as management
does not believe it is more likely than not that we will be invoiced for additional services. 

ordinary shares, with a par value of per share. Holders of the ordinary shares are entitled
to one vote for each ordinary share. At April 5, 2022, there was ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 
ordinary shares subject to possible redemption. The Sponsor has agreed to forfeit ordinary shares to the extent that the over-allotment
option is not exercised in full by the underwriter. On April 5, 2022, the underwriter fully exercised the over-allotment option, as such
there are no ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. 

Warrants 

Each
warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of per share commencing 30 days after the completion of
its initial business combination and expiring five years from after the completion of an initial business combination. No fractional
warrant will be issued and only whole warrants will trade. The Company may redeem the warrants at a price of per warrant upon 30
days notice, only in the event that the last sale price of the ordinary shares is at least per share for any trading
days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there
is an effective registration statement and current prospectus in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants
during the 30 day redemption period. If a registration statement is not effective within days following the consummation of a business
combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company
shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. 

In
addition, if (a) the Company issues additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per share (with such
issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors), (b) the aggregate gross proceeds from
such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business
combination, and (c) the volume weighted average trading price of the ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the
trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the Market
Value, and the last sales price of the ordinary shares that triggers the Company s right to redeem the Warrants will be adjusted
(to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the Market Value.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on May 5, 2021 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange,
asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate
our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, our shares,
debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

We
expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business
Combination will be successful. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through September
30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying
a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenue until after the completion of our initial
Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the Initial
Public Offering. We incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing
compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a net income of 144,123 and net income of 662,376, respectively, which consists
of operating costs of 329,618 and 110,635, interest income of 473,741 and 773,011. 

17 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a net income of 833,308 and 1,724,307, respectively, which consists of operating
costs of 565,585 and 598,030, interest income of 1,398,893 and 2,322,337. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements were prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated
deficit of 6,788,432 and a working capital deficit of 3,910,227 as of September 30, 2024, which raises substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. We will need to raise additional
capital through loans or additional investments from our Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Our officers,
directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Until the consummation of the Business Combination, we will
be using the funds not held in the Trust Account. 

On
April 5, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 330,000 Private Units to the Sponsor at a price of 10.00
per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds of 3,300,000. 

Following
the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, a total of 115,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 5,704,741
in transaction costs, including 2,300,000 of underwriting fees, 2,875,000 of deferred underwriting fees and 529,741 of other offering
costs. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities was nil and 422,843, respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 500,000 and net cash provided by investing
activities is 58,208,582, respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 500,000 and net cash used in financing
activities was 57,963,227, respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had investments held in the Trust Account of 37,257,981. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held
in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding deferred underwriting commissions,
to complete our Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. To the extent that our share
capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the
Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of nil held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account
primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents
and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an
affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may loan us funds as may be required. Such Working Capital Loans would
be evidenced by promissory notes. If we complete a Business Combination, we may repay such notes out of the proceeds of the Trust Account
released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the
Trust Account to repay such notes, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of notes
may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit, at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private
Units. 

18 

In
order to complete a Business Combination, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from
its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not
obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion,
to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company
is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but
not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses.
The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern if a Business Combination is not
consummated. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as
variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative
services, provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on April 5, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until
the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the Company s liquidation. 

The
underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of two and one-half percent (2.5 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering,
or 2,500,000. The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account,
subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

On
January 3, 2023, the Company issued a promissory note in the principal amount of up to 1,000,000 (the Promissory Note to M-Star Management Corp. Pursuant to which the Sponsor shall loan to the Company up to 1,000,000 to pay the extension fee and transaction
cost. The Notes bear no interest and are repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) December 31, 2023 or (b) the date of the consummation
of the Company s initial business combination. The issuance of the Note was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained
in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company amended and restated Promissory Note (the Amended Promissory
Note in order to a) increase the available principal amount from 1,000,000 to 2,500,000 on April 18, 2023, and b) change the
repayment term as repayable in full upon the date of the consummation of the Company s initial business combination. On December
22, 2023, the Company amended and restated Promissory Note (the Second Amended Promissory Note in order to increase the
available principal amount from 2,500,000 up to 3,000,000. 

In
connection the shareholders meeting to vote for the proposal to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association, the public shares are entitled to exercise the redemption right and 5,885,324 public shares tendered for redemption.
As a result of the exercise of the redemption right, 5,614,676 public shares remain unredeemed. Pursuant to the terms of our memorandum
and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Wilmington Trust, National Association and Vstock Transfer
LLC in connection with our IPO, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended,
our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust
account 187,188 0.033 per public share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each monthly extension starting from
February 2023.

General
Meeting 

On
January 26, 2023, the Company held its Extraordinary General Meeting at which the Company s shareholders approved proposals to
(i) amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company has
to consummate a business combination to February 5, 2024. As a result of the exercise of the redemption right, 5,885,324 shares held
by public shareholders are redeemed. 

On
October 30, 2023, Metal Sky Star Acquisition Corporation (the Company or Metal Sky Star held its Extraordinary
General Meeting (the Extraordinary General Meeting at which the Company s shareholders approved proposals to (i)
amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company has to
consummate a business combination to August 5, 2024 and to reduce the amount of the fee to extend such time period (the Charter
Amendment Proposal and (ii) amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement dated March 30, 2022 among the Company, Wilmington
Trust, National Association (the Trustee and Vstock Transfer LLC Vstock to reflect the Charter Amendment
Proposal. 

Following
the Extraordinary General Meeting, effective as of October 31, 2023, the Company, the Trustee and Vstock entered into an amendment to
the Investment Management Trust Agreement (the Amendment Agreement to change the date on which the Company s ability
to complete a business combination may be extended by up to six (6) additional increments of one-month each until August 5, 2024, subject
to the payment into the Trust Account by the Sponsor (or its designees or affiliates) of an amount for each one-month extension equal
to the lesser of (i) 50,000 for all remaining public shares and (ii) 0.033 per public share for each remaining Ordinary Share held
by a Public Stockholder (the Monthly Extension Payment ), and which Monthly Extension Payments, if any, shall be added to
the Trust Account. As a result of the exercise of the redemption of 2,412,260 shares held by public shareholders, 3,202,416 public shares
remain unredeemed as of September 30, 2024. 

On
August 6, 2024, the Company filed the preliminary proxy statements to SEC, which had propose to amend the memorandum and articles of
association of the Company to extend the date of consummate a business combination to April 5, 2025. Until the filing date, the Extraordinary
General Meeting have not been held and the proxy statement have not approved by shareholders. 

On October 22, 2024, the Company filed the preliminary proxy statements
to SEC, which had proposed the Extension Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal to allow the Company more time to complete an initial
business combination. Currently, its Amended and Restated M AA provided that the Company has 28 months from the consummation of the
IPO, or August 5, 2024, to complete a business combination. The purpose of the Extension Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal is
to allow the Company the option to further extend the time to complete a business combination. The failure to complete a business combination
by August 5, 2024 triggered the requirement for an automatic redemption of the Public Shares, which was required to be completed by August
19, 2024, ten business days after August 5, 2024, pursuant to Article 36.2 of the Amended and Restated M AA. The failure to complete
the Automatic Redemption by August 19, 2024 contradicts to Article 36.2 of the Amended and Restated M AA. However, the Board has determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company s shareholders to proceed with the Extension because they are in the process of
searching for an alternative target and negotiating a business combination with various targets. 

The Company has identified several potential targets and entered into a
non-disclosure agreement dated May 6, 2024, with a potential target in the telecommunications industry located in Armenia. The Company
entered into a confidentiality agreement dated September 24, 2024, and a non-binding letter of intent dated September 27, 2024, regarding
a business combination with Okidoki O , one of Estonia s largest and most popular general classifieds platform and also entered
into a letter of intent dated October 15, 2024, regarding a business combination with Fedilco Group Limited, a Cyprus based company holding
80 equity interest of Viva Armenia Closed Joint-Stock Company, an Armenia-based telecommunication company. 

The letter of intents are intended solely to indicate mutual interest in
the proposed business combination between the potential targets and us. Unless and until a definitive agreement for the proposed business
combination is signed, none of the parties to the letter of intents have any legal obligation to the other regarding the proposed business
combination. Therefore, the Board has decided to allow the Company to extend the time to complete a business combination for an additional
eight one-month periods, beginning on August 5, 2024 to April 5, 2025, and hold the Extraordinary General Meeting to provide shareholders
with the right to redeem their Public Shares if they so elect. The Company filed the preliminary proxy statement for the Extraordinary
General Meeting on August 6, 2024, one day after the August 5, 2024 termination date had passed. The preliminary proxy statement was filed
after the August 5, 2024 because its management team was preoccupied with efforts to amend and restate historical financial statements
and prepare the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and three months ended March 31, 2024, and June 30,
2024, while at the same time the Company changed its legal counsel, causing delay in realizing that the extension deadline was approaching.
The Board believes that its shareholders have been compensated for the delay in the completion of the redemption process because the Sponsor
and/or its affiliate has deposited 50,000 to the Trust Account on each August 8, 2024, September 3, 2024, and October 21, 2024. 

Merger
Agreement 

On
April 12, 2023, Metal Sky entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Future Dao Group Holding
Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the Future Dao ), and Future Dao League Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company
and wholly owned subsidiary of Future Dao (the Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Metal Sky (the First Merger ), with Metal Sky surviving
the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Future Dao, and (ii) Metal Sky will merge with and into Future Dao (the Second
Merger and together with the First Merger, the Mergers ), with Future Dao surviving the Second Merger (the Second
Business Combination ). Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, Future Dao will effect a recapitalization of its equity
securities (the Recapitalization including a share split of each outstanding Future Dao Ordinary Share into such number
of Future Dao Ordinary Shares, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, such that, based on a value of 350 million
for all of the outstanding Future Dao Ordinary Shares, each Future Dao Ordinary Share will have a value of 10.00 per share after giving
effect to such share split (the Share Split ). The Business Combination has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors
of both Metal Sky and Future Dao pursuant to a written resolution. 

On
October 6, 2023, the parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Termination of Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Termination
Agreement ), pursuant to which, among other things, the parties agreed to mutually terminate the Merger Agreement, pursuant to
Section 10.01 (a) of the Merger Agreement, effective as of October 6, 2023 (the Termination ). 

As
a result of the Termination, the Merger Agreement will be of no further force and effect except as provided in Section 10.02 of the Merger
Agreement, and the Transaction Agreements (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will either be terminated in accordance with their terms
or be of no further force and effect. Neither party will be required to pay the other any fees or expenses as a result of the Termination.
Metal Sky, Future Dao and Merger Sub have also agreed on behalf of themselves and their respective related parties, to a release of claims
relating to the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement. 

On October 1, 2024, the Company has entered into a
non-binding letter of intent for a business combination with Okidoki O , and existing equity holders would roll 100 of their equity
into the combined public company, based on a total equity value of 120 million for Okidoki. The Company expects to announce additional
details regarding the proposed business combination when a definitive agreement is executed, which is expected in the fourth quarter of
2024. 

There are no guarantees that the parties will successfully
negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement, or that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently
contemplated, or at all. Any transaction would be subject to board and equity holder approval of both companies, regulatory approvals
and other customary conditions. 

On November 4, 2024 The company has entered
into a letter of intent with Fedilco Group Limited, a Cyprus-based company holding an 80 equity interest in Viva Armenia Closed Joint-Stock
Company, an Armenia-based telecom company. Pursuant to the LOI, the company expresses interest in acquiring all the issued and outstanding
shares of Fedilco. The parties will seek necessary permissions and/or approvals from the Republic of Armenia s state authorities
for the proposed transaction.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Warrants 

The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet
the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under
ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could
potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions
for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance
and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For
issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants
are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. 

Ordinary
Shares Subject to Redemption 

The
Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured
at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within
the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control)
are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Company s
ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control and subject to occurrence
of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value (plus any interest
earned on the Trust Account) as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of the Company s balance sheets. 

Net
Loss Per Ordinary Share 

We
apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, which are not currently
redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per ordinary share since such
shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. Our net income (loss) is adjusted for the
portion of income that is attributable to ordinary shares subject to redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of
the Trust Account and not our income or losses. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our financial statements.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering,
the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including amounts in the Trust Account, have been invested in certain U.S. government
securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term
nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, relating to: (i) ineffective
review and approval procedures over journal entries and financial statement preparation which resulted in errors not being timely identified
in prior period financial statements, such as the misclassification of the trust account balance and deferred underwriting commissions
payable as current assets and current liabilities instead of non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively; (ii) lack
of segregation of duties of CEO and CFO for performing formal process of reviewing transactions. We concluded that the failure to timely
identify such accounting errors constituted material weakness as defined in the SEC regulations. As such, management determined that
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of
September 30, 2024. 

To
respond to these material weaknesses, we have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation
and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable
accounting requirements, we plan to enhance our system of evaluating and implementing the complex accounting standards that apply to
our financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents
and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications
and add second approval which establish a dual-approval process to ensure proper segregation of duties. The elements of our remediation
plan can only be accomplished over the time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects,
or that any additional material weaknesses or of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain
adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. Even if we are successful in strengthening our
controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors
or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We
are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against
us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our final
prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on April 4, 2022. Any of these factors could result in a significant or
material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that
we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, other than
as described herein and below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for our Initial
Public Offering filed with the SEC on April 4, 2022 and the annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,
filed with the SEC on July 29, 2024.

Nasdaq
may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities
and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

Our
securities are listed on the Nasdaq. On May 31, 2024, we received a delinquency notification letter (the First Notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of Nasdaq due to the non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
as a result of our failure to timely file the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 and its Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024. On July 12, 2024, we received a written notice (the Second Notice from
Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) (the Minimum Public Holders Rule ), which
requires us to have at least 400 public holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. 

On August 7, 2024, we received a determination letter
(the First Determination Letter from Nasdaq indicating that, unless the we timely request a hearing before the Panel, our
securities (units, ordinary shares, warrants, and rights) would be subject to suspension and delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market
at the opening of business on August 16, 2024 due to the Company s non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special
purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration
statement, or such shorter time that we specify in our articles of association, as amended. In addition, our failure to file the 2023
10-K and the 2024 Q1 10-Q served as an additional and separate basis for delisting, and as such, the Company would be required to address
this concern before the Panel if it appeals Staff s determination as well. The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel.
The hearing request resulted in a stay of any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. 

On September 5, 2024, we received the Second Determination
Letter from Nasdaq indicating that as a result of its failure to timely file the 2024 Q2 10-Q, and failure to have at least 400 public
holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, both of these matters serve as separate and additional basis for delisting
the Company s securities. We filed the 2023 10-K on August 30, 2024, and the 2024 Q1 10-Q and 2024 Q2 10-Q on September 18, 2024.
We had a hearing before the Nasdaq hearings panel on September 19, 2024. Although we believe that we demonstrated compliance with the
400 public holder requirement at the Nasdaq hearing, the additional redemptions that may take place in connection with the vote to extend
the time to complete a business combination may again reduce the number of our public shareholders to below 400. 

The Panel issued its decision letter on October 3,
2024, granting our request to continue the listing on Nasdaq until November 30, 2024, in order to amend our Amended and Restated M AA
to extend the deadline for completing a business combination. We cannot assure you that we will successfully amend the Amended and Restated
M AA to extend the business combination deadline before November 30, 2024. If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on
its exchange after November 30, 2024, and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such
securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences,
including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our securities; 

a determination that our ordinary shares are a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of
1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to
as covered securities. Because our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our securities qualify as covered securities under the
statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to
investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate
or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or
restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably
and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states.
Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would
be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.
