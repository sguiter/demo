The
computation excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater
than the average market price of the common stock during the period. 

Basic
net loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net
loss per share is computed similar to basic net loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were
dilutive. The Company uses the if-converted method for calculating the earnings per share impact of outstanding convertible
debentures, whereby the securities are assumed converted and an earnings per incremental share is computed. Options, warrants and their
equivalents are included in EPS calculations through the treasury stock method. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average
number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. In addition, there
were no vested restricted stock for periods presented. Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the basic and diluted net income
per share are as follows: 

Warrants to purchase common stock 

Incentive shares payable issued with convertible notes 

Restricted stock awards 

Options to purchase common stock

The
Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be
indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from
the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair
value less costs to sell.

To
the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair
value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value
hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed
and is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The
carrying value of the Company s cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including lines of credit and
notes payable), and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity. 

As

The PPP loans were expected to be forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Association SBA and as such, were not made eligible
for any distributions under the amended joint Plan of Reorganization which was approved on February 23, 2021 (the Plan ).
The Plan further required the Company to file proper forgiveness applications with the SBA no later than February 19, 2021. The Company
successfully filed for and received forgiveness confirmation for one of the PPP loans for plus interest. The remaining two PPP
loans forgiveness applications were not properly completed and filed by former management. As of September 30, 2024, the SBA s
website shows those two remaining PPP loans reflected as Charged Off . As a result of this recent discovery, the Company
has reinitiated forgiveness applications with the SBA and expects those loans to be forgiven in full during 2024. As of September 30,

respectively, and corresponding cash from operations of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of . This performance reflected challenges in operating and restructuring the company as a result
of the previous issues that confronted the Company in the healthcare market, such as growing referral bases and negotiating favorable
contract rates with third party payors for services rendered, as well as the negative impact of the former CEO indictment in November
2018 and the bankruptcy from September 2020. As a result of the former CEO s actions the Company has been subject to litigation
as well as incurring damage to its relationships with its employees and referral sources. The Company s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the success of its continuing efforts to acquire profitable companies, grow its revenue base, reduce
operating costs, especially as related to provider services, and access additional sources of capital, and/or sell assets. The Company
believes that it will be successful in repairing its relationships with employees and referral sources, generating growth and improved
profitability resulting in improved cash flows from operations. 

However,
in order to execute the Company s business development plan, which there can be no assurance we will achieve, the Company may need
to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means and potentially
reduce operating expenditures. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may have to curtail its business development
initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve its cash, thus raising substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern more than one year from the date of issuance of the September 30, 2024 financial statements included in
this filing.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ).
Forward-looking statements reflect the current view about future events. When used in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the words anticipate, 
 believe, estimate, expect, future, intend, plan, 
or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements.
Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q relating to our business
strategy, our future operating results, and our liquidity and capital resources outlook. Forward-looking statements are based on our
current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements
relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our
actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical
fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, the execution of our strategy; evolving healthcare laws and regulations; changes in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements
for medical services; accelerated pace of consolidation in the hospital industry; changes in our medical technology as it relates to
our services and procedures; any failures in our information technology systems to protect the privacy and security of protected information
and other similar cyber security risks; our ability to raise capital to fund continuing operations; and other factors relating to our
industry, our operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended
or planned. 

Factors
or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of
them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including
the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results. 

Results
of Operations 

Overview 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, we reported a net loss of 3,884,911 and 7,703,815, respectively,
a decrease of 3,818,904 or 50 . The decrease the net loss was attributable to a reduction in operating expenses and non-operating
expenses for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023, The decrease in operating expenses resulted
from a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in non-operating expenses was the result of decreases in
interest expenses, including suspending of accruing interest on debt that was subject to the Series C Preferred Stock exchanges, and
reduction in the amortization of original issue discount and deferred financing costs. 

The
following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollars and percentages of total revenues:

The
following is a discussion of the results of operations for the nine ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Revenues 

Total
revenue was 19,801) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreasing 47 from 12,450) in the prior year. Net patient service
revenue accounted for all of total revenue. The decrease in patient service revenue was the result of the reduction of service offerings
and an increase in bad debt reserves.

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses include the following: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Salaries and benefits 
 330,815 
 529,064

 Total operating expenses 
 1,405,973 
 2,418,853 

The
major components of operating expenses include salaries and benefits, practice supplies and other operating costs, depreciation and general
and administrative expenses, which included legal, accounting and professional fees associated with being a public entity. 

Salaries
and benefits decreased by 37 to 330,815 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the company s strategic pivot initiative which includes a reduction in highly compensated
physicians and contract staff for the interim period. 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by 807,097 or 43 to 1,049,193 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,856,290
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in spending is primarily related to lower facility, legal, and professional
costs. 

Depreciation
and amortization decreased by 7,534 or 22 to for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25,965 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the retirement or sale of physical therapy equipment. 

Net
Loss from Operations 

Net
loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1,425,774, which compared to a loss from operations of 2,432,303
for the prior year, a decrease of 1,006,529 or 41 . The reduction is a result of the operating expenses discussed above, partially offset
by an increase in net revenue. 

Interest
Income (expense) 

Interest
expense decreased by 2,725,074 or 53 to 2,464,387 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which compared to interest expense
of 5,189,461 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to lower original issue discounts amortized
to interest expense and suspending interest expense on debt that is committed to the Series C Preferred Stock exchange agreements. 

Net
Loss attributable to FCHS Shareholders 

As
a result of all the above, we reported net loss attributable to common shareholders of 3,954,535 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of 7,771,338 reported for the same period in the prior year, a
reduction of 3,816,803 or 49 . 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,505 and accounts receivables, net totaling 49,201. This compared to cash of 1,468 and accounts
receivable, net of 92,747 as of September 30, 2023. 

The
Company believes that the current cash balance as of September 30, 2024, along with continued execution of its business development plan,
will provide the opportunity for the Company to further improve its working capital. 

However,
in order to execute the Company s business development plan, which there can be no assurance we will achieve, the Company will
need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means and
potentially reduce operating expenditures. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be required to curtail its business
development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs to conserve its cash. See Note 7 Going Concern. 

Net
cash provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 685,385, which compared to net cash used
in our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 5,077,958. The increase of 5,763,343 in cash provided for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to decreases in accounts payable, short term debt, accrued liabilities, partially offset
by an increase in other current assets associated with lease deposits on new leased clinic facilities. 

Net
cash flows used in investing activities was 1,638,987) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided
of by investing activities 142,903 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net cash provided from investing
activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase of right to use assets associated with
new leased clinic facilities. 

18 

Net
cash provided in financing activities was 942,500 for nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided in financing
activities of 4,929,304 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash flows provided in our financing activities were the result
of:

Inflation 

Our
opinion is that inflation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

At
September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources. 

New
Accounting Pronouncements 

We
do not expect recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. See Footnote 2 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information
required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

19 

PART
II 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm our business. 

Our
contracts with hospitals generally require us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our
care providers. Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other
claims, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us
in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage
for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. 

Estimates
of reasonably possible additional losses, both for each individual matter and in the aggregate, are not material to our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

We
are currently not a party to any pending legal proceedings, nor is our property the subject of a pending legal proceeding, that is not
in the ordinary course of business or otherwise material to the financial condition of our business.
