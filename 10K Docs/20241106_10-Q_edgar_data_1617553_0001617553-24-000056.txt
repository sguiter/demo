 NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, will, estimate, potential, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, could, would, project, plan, target, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses including changes in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses (including any components of the foregoing), and our ability to achieve and/or maintain future profitability 
 effects of a variety of global business and macroeconomic factors that affect our business, the employment market, and the economy in general, including inflationary pressures, a volatile interest rate environment, increasing borrowing costs, cybersecurity incidents, the U.S. presidential and other federal, state and local elections, and the impacts of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; 
 our business plan and our ability to effectively manage our growth 
 our ability to compete with well-established competitors and new entrants; 
 our ability to enhance our marketplace and introduce new and improved offerings; 
 our ability to increase the number of employers and job seekers in our marketplace 
 our ability to strengthen our technology that underpins our marketplace; 
 our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel; 
 our ability to execute our strategy; 
 our beliefs and objectives for future operations 
 the effects of seasonal trends on our results of operations 
 our ability to expand to new markets; 
 our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand and intellectual property 
 our ability to stay in compliance with laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business 
 economic and industry trends, projected growth, or trend analysis; and 
 increased expenses associated with being a public company. 
 We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including

Table of Contents 

 those described in the section titled Risk Factors. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. 
 As used herein, ZipRecruiter, the Company, we, us, our, and similar terms include ZipRecruiter, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 
 SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled Risk Factors later in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Our business is significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic conditions. There is risk that any economic recovery may be delayed, short-lived and/or uneven, and may not result in increased demand for our services. 
 We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Our marketplace functions on software that is highly technical and complex and if it fails to perform properly, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline and we could be subject to liability claims. 
 Our future success depends in part on employers purchasing and renewing or upgrading subscriptions and performance-based services from us. Any decline in our user renewals or upgrades or performance-based services could harm our future operating results. 
 If we fail to scale our business effectively, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Significant segments of the market for job advertisement services may have hiring needs and service preferences that are subject to greater volatility than the overall economy. 
 Our efforts and ability to sell to a broad mix of businesses could adversely affect our operating results in a given period. 
 Our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, including senior management and key personnel. If we lose the services of Ian Siegel, our Chief Executive Officer, or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy.

 If internet search engines methodologies or other channels that we use to direct traffic to our website are modified to our disadvantage, or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, our user growth could decline. 
 Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business, which makes our future results difficult to predict. 
 Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of the ZipRecruiter brand. 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 
 Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our Class A common stock and could subject us to litigation. 
 The dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to our listing, including our directors, executive officers, and 5 stockholders. This ownership will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 1 Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the sections titled Risk Factors and Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

OVERVIEW 
 Our Mission is t o actively connect people to their next great opportunity. 
 ZipRecruiter is a two-sided marketplace for work. We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by employers to post jobs and access other features in our marketplace. We offer our employers flat rate pricing on terms typically ranging from a day to a year, or performance-based pricing, such as cost-per-click, to align with each employer s hiring needs. 
 ZipRecruiter is free to use for job seekers. Job seekers come to ZipRecruiter in search of their next opportunity. After establishing a profile, job seekers are able to apply to jobs with a single click. Our artificial intelligence-powered career advisor, Phil, curates jobs and proactively sends alerts for new opportunities where they are a Great Match, which is a designation assigned by ZipRecruiter s technology to indicate a high potential fit between a job seeker and a job. As our matching technology learns more about job seekers preferences and attributes, our technology offers increasingly higher quality matches. 
 We plan to continue to invest aggressively in our marketplace to improve functionality and drive growth for the foreseeable future. We have made significant investments in our business to expand our employer and job seeker footprints, increase their engagement and enhance our datasets and machine learning. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue was 117.1 million and we had a net loss of 2.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of 15.0 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our revenue was 155.6 million, and we generated net income of 24.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of 54.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue was 363.0 million and we had a net loss of 2.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of 63.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our revenue was 509.8 million, and we generated net income of 43.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of 132.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, an explanation of our management s use of this measure and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see the section titled Key Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

 KEY OPERATING METRICS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions: 
 March 31, 2023 June 30, 2023 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 Quarterly Paid Employers 105,948 101,634 89,668 70,712 71,572 70,458 65,222 Revenue per Paid Employer 1,734 1,677 1,736 1,922 1,708 1,755 1,795 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Adjusted EBITDA 14,988 54,380 63,617 132,914 Adjusted EBITDA margin 13 35 18 26 
 Quarterly Paid Employers 
 We quantify the revenue-generating customer base as the number of Paid Employers in our marketplace. The Quarterly Paid Employer metric includes all actively recruiting employers (or entities acting on behalf of employers) on a paying subscription plan or performance marketing campaign for at least one day in a given quarter. Paid Employers excludes employers from our third-party sites or other indirect channels, employers who are not actively recruiting, and employers on free-trials. This group of employers excluded from our Paid Employer count does not contribute a significant amount of revenue. 
 In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Quarterly Paid Employers decreased when compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Employers continued to moderate hiring plans given the uncertainty in the economy, in part driven by high interest rates. With those currently employed leaving their jobs at a low rate, the reduced churn among employees further drove down hiring levels. 
 Revenue per Paid Employer 
 We evaluate Revenue per Paid Employer as a key indicator of our efforts to increase value provided to employers in our marketplace. We define Revenue per Paid Employer as total company revenue in a given period divided by Quarterly Paid Employers in the same period. 
 In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Revenue per Paid Employer increased slightly when compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. While we saw Quarterly Paid Employers decrease during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the current softness in hiring demand amidst the challenging economic climate, we believe our products and services continued to improve and offered more value for employers of all sizes.

 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income (loss) before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. In addition, these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, our investments in research and development, sales and marketing, headcount and our ability to generate revenue. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net income (loss) (1)

 (1) Net income (loss) includes one-time charges resulting from our restructuring plan announced on May 31, 2023 to reduce our global workforce by approximately 20 . Restructuring activity for the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflects 0.7 million in costs reversed when it was determined such costs would not need to be paid, partially offset by restructuring costs of 0.3 million related to employee severance and continuation of health benefits. Restructuring activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects 7.9 million of net costs primarily related to employee severance and continuation of health benefits. No restructuring costs were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions 
 We had a lower number of Quarterly Paid Employers in our marketplace in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior-year period. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we delivered 117.1 million in revenue, which is a 25 decrease compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Despite Revenue per Paid Employer being higher in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 as our products and services continued to improve and offered more value for employers, we saw employers significantly reduce spend on products and services in our marketplace during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 amidst the continuing challenging macroeconomic conditions. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily from fees paid by employers to post and distribute jobs in our marketplace, as well as multiple sites managed by Job Distribution Partners, which are third-party sites who have a relationship with us and advertise from our marketplace, and includes job boards, newspaper classifieds, search engines, social networks, talent communities and resume services. 
 Our subscription revenue consists of time-based job posting plans, upsells which complement or expand visibility and prominence to job posting plans, and resume database plans. 
 We offer job posting plans with terms typically ranging from a day to a year on a flat rate subscription basis to access our marketplace, where customers may create and manage job postings and review incoming candidate applications. We recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the subscription service is made available to the customer. Our nonrefundable subscriptions are typically subject to renewal at the end of the subscription term. 
 Our upsell services complement or expand visibility to job posting plans and are typically sold on a subscription basis. Upsell services revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement beginning on the date the upsell services are made available to the customer. Additionally, upsell services include job posting enhancements which are applied to individual job postings. Such services enhance 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 job postings by providing customers with a temporary boost in the prominence of their job postings, expanding visibility to job postings by inviting strong fit potential candidates to apply to the job, or highlighting key attributes of job postings to make them stand out to job seekers. Revenue from job posting enhancements is recognized as the customer uses the enhancements on its job postings. 
 Resume database plans allow our customers to search and view resumes and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. 
 Performance-based revenue is recognized when a candidate clicks on or applies to a job distributed by ZipRecruiter on behalf of a customer. For performance-based revenue, our customers pay an amount per click or per job application usually capped at a contractual maximum per job recruitment campaign. 
 For a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Note 2 Basis of Presentation, Principles of Consolidation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists of third-party hosting fees, credit card processing fees, personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for customer support employees, partner revenue share amounts, job distribution costs from performance-based revenue, and amortization of capitalized software costs associated with our marketplace technology to provide services for our customers. In addition, we allocate a portion of overhead costs, such as rent, IT costs, supplies, and depreciation and amortization, to cost of revenue based on headcount. 
 We expect cost of revenue to increase or decrease in absolute dollars in direct correlation to revenue in future periods due to payment processing fees, third-party hosting fees, personnel-related costs to support additional transaction volume, and amortization expense associated with our capitalized internal-use software and development cost. We expect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to remain relatively flat from year to year but may vary from quarter to quarter as a percentage of our revenue due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may be influenced by our revenue, timing and amount of investments to expand hosting capacity, our continued investments in our support teams, and the amortization expense associated with our capitalized internal-use software and development cost. We expect our gross margin to remain relatively flat from year to year but may vary from quarter to quarter as a percentage of our revenue due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 Costs and Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense consists of personnel-related costs (including salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for our sales and marketing employees, marketing activities, and related allocated overhead costs. Marketing activities include advertising, online lead generation, customer and industry events, and candidate acquisition. We allocate a portion of overhead costs, such as rent, IT costs, supplies, and depreciation and amortization, to sales and marketing expense based on headcount. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. 
 We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase or decrease on an absolute dollar basis as we adjust our highly variable sales and marketing spend budget throughout economic cycles to reallocate or conserve spend to where we see the greatest returns. Additionally, sales and marketing 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 expenses may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future as we constantly measure the expected returns of specific sales and marketing initiatives and adjust spend levels up or down accordingly. This discipline has been a key aspect of our strong financial performance through a wide range of macroeconomic conditions. We expect that these expenses will continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand on our sales and marketing efforts over time. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense consists of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for our research and development employees, amortization of capitalized software costs associated with the development of internal databases, candidate insights, and reporting that supports our marketplace technology and the cost of certain third-party service providers. We allocate a portion of overhead costs, such as rent, IT costs, supplies, and depreciation and amortization, to research and development expenses based on headcount. Research and development costs, other than software development costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred. 
 We believe continued investments in research and development are important to attain our strategic objectives, and expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars. This expense may vary as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, our marketplace, expansion of our services, as well as other research and development programs, including the hiring of engineering, product development, and design employees to support these efforts. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense consists of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for employees in our executive, finance, human resource and administrative departments, and fees for third-party professional services, including consulting, legal and accounting services. In addition, we allocate a portion of overhead costs, such as rent, IT costs, supplies, and depreciation and amortization, to general and administrative expense based on headcount. 
 We expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and higher expenses for professional services. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest costs associated with our outstanding borrowings, undrawn fees associated with our credit facility, and amortization of issuance costs for our credit facility and senior unsecured notes. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income recognized on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, gains and losses from foreign currency exchange transactions, and realized gains and losses recognized on sales of available-for-sale debt securities. We have foreign currency exposure primarily related to personnel-related expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Canadian Dollar, British Pound and the Israeli New Shekel. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States, as well as several international jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to tax detriments relating to the settlement of restricted stock units, or RSUs, limitations on the amount of deductible officer compensation, state taxes,

 and net tax benefits from research and development tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to state taxes, tax detriments relating to the settlement of RSUs, and limitations on the amount of deductible officer compensation, partially offset by net tax benefits from research and development tax credits.

 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.7 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing employees decreased by 2.0 million corresponding with lower headcount in the current period. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 1.0 million in marketing and advertising spend compared to the prior-year period. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 55.1 million, or 25 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 32.3 million decrease in marketing and advertising compared to the prior-year period reflecting our discipline in proactively adjusting marketing spend levels in relation to the macroeconomic conditions. The decrease was also driven by a decrease of 16.7 million in personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing employees corresponding with lower headcount in the current-year period, and was further driven by one-time restructuring costs of 3.6 million related to our May 2023 reduction in force incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Research and development expenses increased by 1.6 million, or 5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.5 million increase in personnel-related costs for our research and development employees reflecting salaries and other personnel-related costs in connection with Breakroom employees with no comparable expenses in the prior-year period, as we acquired 100 of the outstanding share capital in Breakroom in July 2024. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower revenue. We expect to continue to invest in research and development activities, and we expect this expense may vary as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 6.0 million, or 5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling 497.6 million and 287.6 million available in unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility. We have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash generated from operations, sales of shares of common and preferred stock and from our senior unsecured notes, bank loans, and convertible notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility. 
 We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flow from operations, and amounts available for borrowing under our bank loan agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. To the extent existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash from operations, and amounts available for borrowing are insufficient to fund

 future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. 
 Credit Facility 
 In April 2021, we entered into a 250.0 million credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks. In July 2024, we entered into a supplement to the credit facility agreement which increased the aggregate revolving commitments available under the credit facility from 250.0 million to 290.0 million. The credit facility has a maturity date of April 30, 2026 and bears interest at a rate based upon our Net Leverage Ratio. Our Net Leverage Ratio is defined as total debt less total cash and permitted investments outstanding at period end, with a maximum total cash and permitted investments adjustment of 550.0 million, divided by the trailing 12 months of earnings, adjusted for items such as non-cash expenses and other nonrecurring transactions. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees including a commitment fee on a quarterly basis based on amounts committed but unused under the credit facility at a rate between 0.25 to 0.35 , depending on our Net Leverage Ratio. The amount available under the credit facility is reduced by letters of credit outstanding, which totaled 2.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The letters of credit outstanding relate to various leased office spaces. 
 The credit facility is collateralized by security interests in substantially all of our assets and includes customary events of default such as non-payment of principal, non-payment of interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of certain covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments against us, and a change of control. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility. 
 The credit facility agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements, negative covenants, and financial covenants, such as maintenance of certain net leverage ratio requirements. The negative covenants include restrictions that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur liens and indebtedness, make certain investments, declare dividends, dispose of, transfer or sell assets, make stock repurchases and consummate certain other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. 
 For more information on the credit facility, please see Note 9 Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and are in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.

 Issuance of Senior Unsecured Notes 
 On January 12, 2022, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 550.0 million senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private placement. The senior unsecured notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of January 12, 2022, or the Indenture. Pursuant to the Indenture, the senior unsecured notes will mature on January 15, 2030 and bear interest at a rate of 5 per year. Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. 
 The Indenture contains certain customary negative covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of debt, limitations on liens, limitations on consolidations or mergers, and limitations on asset sales. The Indenture also contains customary events of default. 
 At any time prior to January 15, 2030, we have the option, at our sole discretion, to redeem all or a portion of our senior unsecured notes subject to the payment of certain premiums, make-whole provisions, and accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, we must offer to repurchase the senior unsecured notes at a repurchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount to be repurchased, and any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 For more information on the senior unsecured notes, please see Note 9 Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 550.0 million of our outstanding common stock, with no fixed expiration. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 37.6 million through open market purchases under our share repurchase program. 
 Approximately 25.8 million remains available for future repurchases of our Class A common stock under our share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. For more information, see Note 10 Share Repurchase Program to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Investments 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued investing primarily in highly rated debt securities and money market mutual funds to manage our excess cash reserves. The primary objectives in investing our excess cash reserves are to preserve capital, provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy both operational cash flow requirements and potential strategic investment opportunities, and to obtain a reasonable or market rate of return on investments. We consider all of our investments as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities within current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 325.0 million in total investments, consisting of money market mutual funds and available-for-sale debt securities. These investments are included within cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For more

 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):

 (43,594) (142,185) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 (57,429) 15,959 
 Operating Activities 
 The primary source of operating cash inflows is cash collected from our customers for our services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, marketing costs and third-party costs incurred to support our marketplace. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 33.2 million resulting from our net loss of 2.1 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of 54.7 million and a net decrease of 19.4 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily resulted from 49.2 million for stock-based compensation expense, 9.1 million pertaining to amortization of intangible assets and depreciation, and 3.0 million pertaining to non-cash lease expense, partially offset by 8.0 million in amortization and accretion of marketable securities and 1.6 million related to the change in our deferred tax assets driven by our current year capitalization of research costs from a tax perspective. The decrease of 19.4 million related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an 8.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a 6.8 million decrease in accrued interest, a 5.0 million decrease in our accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a 4.0 million decrease in our operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a 3.0 million decrease in accounts receivable and a 1.5 million decrease in deferred commissions, net. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was 68.8 million resulting from our net income of 43.5 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of 48.2 million and a net decrease of 23.0 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily resulted from 58.3 million for stock-based compensation expense, 8.5 million pertaining to amortization of intangible assets and depreciation, and 3.2 million pertaining to non-cash lease expense, partially offset by 16.8 million related to the change in our deferred tax assets driven by our current year capitalization of research costs from a tax perspective and the tax-related impact of stock-based compensation, and 8.6 million in amortization and accretion of marketable securities. The decrease of 23.0 million related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an 18.6 million decrease in our accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, a 6.9 million decrease in our accrued interest associated with our senior unsecured notes, a 4.8 million decrease in our operating lease liabilities, and a 3.4 million decrease in our deferred revenue, partially offset by an 8.9 million decrease in accounts receivable associated with a decrease in revenue due to a lower number of Quarterly Paid Employers in our marketplace compared to the prior-year period, and a 1.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 47.1 million resulting from 480.1 million used in purchases of marketable securities, 12.0 million paid for the

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by investing activities was 89.4 million resulting from 421.5 million received from paydowns, maturities and redemptions of marketable securities, partially offset by 323.8 million used in purchases of marketable securities and an increase in capitalized software development costs of 7.5 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 43.6 million which consisted of 37.6 million used for the repurchase of common stock and 11.1 million for the net settlement of taxes on equity awards, partially offset by 3.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan, and 1.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

 Obligations and Other Commitments 
 See the 2023 Form 10-K for our future minimum commitments related to certain software service agreements. Through September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 Basis of Presentation, Principles of Consolidation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K, except as set forth below. 
 Business Combinations 
 The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 purchase price over the fair values of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. 
 Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may require management to use significant judgment which includes the selection of valuation methodologies. We have determined the fair values of certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination using the replacement cost and relief-from-royalty methods. These methods require estimates surrounding, but not limited to, the time and resources required to replace technology, estimated profit margins and opportunity costs, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount and royalty rates, and selection of comparable companies. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our credit facility which bears a floating interest rate. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We do not believe we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the senior unsecured notes. Our senior unsecured notes are carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our senior unsecured notes, which pay interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. 
 Lastly, we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments. To minimize interest rate risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including commercial market, money market mutual funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. To assess interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the portfolio. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all maturities would result in a 0.6 million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange risk related primarily to expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Canadian Dollar, British Pound, and Israeli New Shekel. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 a result of transaction gains and losses related to the remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. A hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 Risk Related to Our Business 
 Operational Risks 
 Our business is significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic conditions. There is risk that any economic recovery may be delayed, short-lived and/or uneven, and may not result in increased demand for our services. 
 Our business depends on the overall demand for labor and on the economic health of current and prospective employers and job seekers that use our marketplace. Demand for recruiting and hiring services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity and employment in the United States and the other countries in which we operate. Any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or the global economy, increased unemployment, reduced credit availability, reduced business confidence and activity, decreased government spending, economic uncertainty, financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including actual or perceived instability in the banking industry, trade wars and higher tariffs, volatility in interest rates, inflation in the cost of goods and services including labor, and other adverse economic or market conditions may adversely impact our business and operating results. Significant swings in, or periods of reduced, economic activity historically have had a disproportionately negative impact on hiring activity and related efforts to find candidates. We may also experience more pricing pressure during periods of economic downturn. 
 Economic recoveries are difficult to predict, and may be delayed, short-lived, and/or uneven, with some regions, or countries within a region, continuing to experience declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate may affect demand for our marketplace. We may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our marketplace within the markets where our business is concentrated. 
 There has been volatility in financial markets as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, banking instability, global conflict, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, inflation, changes in interest rates, and volatile markets. There is a risk that as a result of these macroeconomic factors, we could continue to experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. Economic uncertainty may cause some of our current or potential employers to curtail spending in our marketplace and may ultimately result in cost challenges to our operations. For example, our employers, including those of our employers that are banks, may be adversely affected by any bank failure or other event affecting financial institutions. Any resulting adverse effects to our employers liquidity or financial

 performance could reduce the demand for our services or affect our allowance for expected credit losses and collectability of accounts receivable. These adverse conditions could result in reductions in revenue, increased operating expenses, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased competition. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally. There is also risk that when overall global economic conditions are positive, our business could be negatively impacted by decreased demand for job postings and our services. If general economic conditions significantly deviate from present levels, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Substantially all of our revenue is generated by our business operations in the United States. Prior to 2020, the United States had largely experienced positive economic and employment trends since our founding in 2010 and therefore we do not have a significant operating history in periods of weak economic environments and cannot predict how our business will perform in such periods. Any significant economic downturn in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We face intense competition from many well-established online job sites such as CareerBuilder and Monster, Craigslist, Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn, as well as from newer entrants such as Google or Facebook. Many of our existing and potential competitors are considerably larger or more established than we are and have larger workforces and more substantial marketing and financial resources. Price competition for job marketplaces such as ours is likely to remain high, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share, subscriber base, revenue and/or profitability. 
 We also compete with companies that utilize emerging technologies and assets, such as large language models (LLMs), machine learning, and other types of artificial intelligence. These competitors may offer products and services that may, among other things, provide automated alternatives to the services that employers or job seekers would otherwise seek from ZipRecruiter, use machine learning algorithms to connect employers with job seekers more effectively than we do, or otherwise change the way that employers engage with job seekers or the way job seekers find work so as to make our marketplace less attractive. We may face increased competition from these competitors as they mature and expand their capabilities. 
 Many of our larger competitors have long-standing relationships or access to employers, including our Paid Employers 1 , as well as those whom we may wish to pursue. Some employers may be hesitant to use a new platform and prefer to upgrade products offered by these incumbent platforms for reasons that include price, quality, sophistication, familiarity and global presence. These platforms could offer competing products on a standalone basis at a low price or bundled as part of a larger product sale that could be more attractive to employers than our offerings. 
 Many of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale, and support of their products and services. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their product offerings and/or resources. If our competitors products, platforms, services or technologies maintain or achieve greater market acceptance than ours, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours, or if their products, platforms or services are more technologically capable than ours, then our revenue could be adversely affected. Also, some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price. If we cannot 
 
 1 Paid Employer(s) means any employer(s) (or entities acting on behalf of an employer) on a paying subscription plan or performance marketing campaign for at least one day. Paid Employer(s) excludes employers from our Job Distribution Partners or other indirect channels, employers who are not actively searching for candidates, but otherwise have access to previously posted jobs, and employers on free trial.

 optimize pricing, our operating results may be negatively affected. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or a failure to maintain or improve our competitive market position, any of which could adversely affect our business. 
 The number of employers distributing their job posting service purchases among a broader group of competitors may increase which may make it more difficult to retain or maintain our current share of business with existing Paid Employers. We also face the risk that employers may decide to provide similar services internally or reduce or redirect their efforts to recruit job seekers through online job advertisements. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future. 
 Our marketplace functions on software that is highly technical and complex and if it fails to perform properly, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline and we could be subject to liability claims. 
 Our marketplace functions on software that is highly technical and complex and may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may be discovered only after the code has been deployed. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after deployment, inability to identify the cause or causes of performance problems within an acceptable period of time, or difficulty maintaining and improving the performance of our marketplace could result in damage to our reputation or brand, loss of employers and job seekers, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 As the usage of our marketplace grows, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to operate our marketplace. If we cannot continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, it may adversely affect our user experience. We also rely on third-party software and infrastructure, including the infrastructure of the internet, to provide our marketplace. Any failure of or disruption to this software and infrastructure, whether intentional or malicious in nature or due to our activities or those of our vendors, could also make our marketplace unavailable to our users. If our marketplace is unavailable to our subscribers or job seekers for any period of time, our business could be adversely affected. 
 Our marketplace technology is constantly changing with new updates, which may contain undetected errors when first introduced or released. Any errors, defects, disruptions in service, or other performance or stability problems with our marketplace, or the insufficiency of our efforts to adequately prevent or timely remedy errors or defects, could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our marketplace, loss of competitive position, our inability to timely and accurately maintain our financial records, inaccurate or delayed invoicing of Paid Employers, delay of payment to us, claims by users for losses sustained by them, corrective action taken by gatekeepers of components integral to our marketplace, or investigation and corrective action taken by a regulatory agency. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for user relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources to help resolve the issue. Accordingly, any errors, defects, or disruptions in our marketplace could adversely impact our brand and reputation, revenue, and operating results. 
 Because of the large amount of data that our Paid Employers collect and manage by means of our services, it is possible that failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption, or cause the information that we or our Paid Employers collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our Paid Employers regard as significant. Furthermore, the availability or performance of our marketplace could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including users inability to access the internet or to send or receive email messages, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or variability in user traffic for our services. We may be required to issue credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused services or otherwise be liable to our users for damages they may incur resulting from certain of these events. In addition to potential liability, if we experience interruptions in the 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 availability of our marketplace, our reputation could be adversely affected and we could lose employers and job seekers. 
 Our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management s attention. 
 Our future success depends in part on employers purchasing and renewing or upgrading subscriptions and performance-based services from us. Any decline in our user renewals or upgrades or performance-based services could harm our future operating results. 
 Many of our Paid Employers pay for access to our marketplace on a per-job-per-day basis, rather than entering into new longer term paid time-based job posting plans, renewing their paid time-based job posting plans when such contract terms expire, or purchasing performance-based services from us. Employers who enter into paid plans have no obligation to renew their plans after the expiration of their contract period, which typically range from one day to 12 months. In addition, employers may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter contract lengths. Historically, some of our Paid Employers have elected not to renew their agreements with us and as we expand into new products and markets, we have a limited ability to reliably predict future renewal rates. Our future renewal rates for both existing and potential new products may be lower, possibly significantly lower, than historical trends. 
 Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell upsell services to employers who use our marketplace. If employers do not purchase upsell services from us, our revenue may decline and our operating results may be harmed. 
 Our Paid Employer subscription renewals, performance-based services, and upsells may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including user usage, sunsetting, changing, or removing certain products or services, user satisfaction with our services and user support, our prices, the prices of competing services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our user base, the effects of U.S. and global economic conditions, or reductions in our Paid Employers spending levels generally. 
 If we fail to scale our business effectively, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 We have experienced a period of significant growth in recent years and expect to continue to invest strategically across our company to support measured growth, while also scaling back certain areas of our business in response to changing macroeconomic conditions. Although we have experienced rapid growth historically, we may not return to prior growth rates or sustain our growth rates, nor can we assure you that our investments to support our growth or to manage expenses by scaling back other areas of our business will be successful. The effective scaling of our business will place significant demands on our management as well as on our administrative, operational, and financial resources. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management information systems expand, motivate, and effectively manage and train our workforce and effectively collaborate with our third-party partners. If we cannot manage any future growth successfully, our business, operating results, financial condition, and ability to successfully advertise our marketplace and serve our employers and job seekers could be adversely affected. 
 Over time, we expect to expand our operations and personnel significantly. However, from time to time, we realign our resources and talent to respond to macroeconomic changes and to streamline our organization and optimize our cost structure, including through furloughs, layoffs and reductions in force. For example, in May 2023, in response to current market conditions and after reducing other discretionary expenses, we reduced our workforce. If there are unforeseen expenses associated with such realignments in our business strategies, and we incur unanticipated charges or liabilities, then we may not be able to effectively realize the expected cost savings or other benefits of such actions. In addition, the loss of certain personnel, through such reduction in force or otherwise, presents significant risks including, among other things, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures. Failure to manage any growth 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 or any scaling back of our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 In addition, our historical growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks, challenges, and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks, challenges, and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our financial condition and operating results could differ materially from our expectations, we may be unable to effectively scale our business, and our business would be adversely impacted. 
 Significant segments of the market for job advertisement services may have hiring needs and service preferences that are subject to greater volatility than the overall economy. 
 The employers in the United States private sector are diverse across a number of business characteristics, including company size, geography, and industry, among other factors. Hiring activity may vary significantly among businesses with different characteristics and accordingly, any concentration we may have among businesses with certain characteristics may subject us to high volatility in our financial results. Smaller businesses, for example, typically have less persistent hiring needs and may experience greater volatility in their need for job advertisement services and preferences among providers of such services. Along with a relatively shorter sales cycle, smaller businesses may be more likely to change platforms based on short-term differences in perceived price, value, service level, or other factors. Difficulty in acquiring and/or retaining these employers may adversely affect our operating results. 
 Our efforts and ability to sell to a broad mix of businesses could adversely affect our operating results in a given period. 
 Our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends, in part, on widespread acceptance and utilization of our marketplace by businesses of all sizes and types. Because our customers reflect a wide variety of businesses, we face a variety of challenges, including but not limited to, pricing pressure, cost variances and marketing strategies that vary based on the business type and size, varying lengths of sales cycles, and less predictability in completing some of our sales. For example, some of our larger prospective customers may need us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our marketplace and services, because the prospective customer s decision to use our marketplace and services may be a company-wide decision. We are in the early stages of developing the analytical tools that will allow us to determine how prospective customers can be most effectively directed within, and addressed by, our sales organizations. As a result, we may not always approach new opportunities in the most cost-effective manner or with the most appropriate resources. Developing and successfully implementing these tools will be important as we seek to efficiently capitalize on new and expanding market opportunities. In addition, because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history when compared to some of our existing competitors, our target employers and job seekers may prefer to use offerings from more established competitors that are more tailored to their specific requirements. 
 Our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, including senior management and key personnel. If we lose the services of Ian Siegel, our Chief Executive Officer, or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy. 
 Our future success depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and our ability to retain and motivate them. In particular, we are dependent on the services of Ian Siegel, our Chief Executive Officer, and our technology, marketplace, future vision, and strategic direction could be compromised if he were to take another position, become ill or incapacitated, or otherwise become unable to serve as our Chief Executive Officer. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of marketing, sales, finance, support, product development, human resources, and technology. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 Our senior management and other key personnel are all employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time, for any reason, and without notice. If we lose the services of senior management or other key personnel, or if we cannot attract, train, and retain the highly skilled personnel we need, or if we fail to implement succession plans for such key personnel, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, including software engineers and sales personnel. We face intense competition for qualified personnel from numerous software and other technology companies. This competition for highly skilled personnel is especially intense in the regions where we have significant operations, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. In addition, in a tight labor market, we may experience increased difficulty in hiring and retaining, or increased costs in attracting and retaining, highly skilled personnel, or we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies at a greater rate. To the extent we move into new geographies, we would need to attract and recruit skilled personnel in those areas. Moreover, uncertainty arising from economy-wide shifts toward remote work could negatively impact our ability to recruit or retain talent, particularly in light of our workforce historically being concentrated largely in the Los Angeles and Phoenix metropolitan areas. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity or equity awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to retain highly skilled employees. If we cannot attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational, and managerial requirements, on a timely basis or at all, our business may be adversely affected. 
 If internet search engines methodologies or other channels that we use to direct traffic to our website are modified to our disadvantage, or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, our user growth could decline. 
 We depend in part on various internet search engines, such as Google, as well as other channels to direct a significant amount of traffic to our website. Our ability to maintain the number of visitors directed to our website is not entirely within our control. For example, our competitors search engine optimization and other efforts such as paid search may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, internet search engines or other channels that we utilize to direct traffic to our website could revise their methodologies in a manner that adversely impacts traffic to our website, or we may make changes to our website that adversely impact our search engine optimization rankings and traffic. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive sufficient traffic to our website, and we may not be able to influence the results. 
 Search engines and other channels that we use to drive employers and job seekers to our website periodically change their algorithms, policies, and technologies, sometimes in ways that cause traffic to our website to decline. These changes can also result in an interruption in their ability to access our website or a drop in our search ranking, or have other adverse impacts that negatively affect our ability to maintain and grow the number of employers and job seekers that visit our website. We may also be forced to significantly increase marketing expenditures in the event that market prices for online advertising and paid listings escalate or our organic ranking decreases. Any of these changes could have an adverse impact on our business, user acquisition, and operating results. 
 Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business, which makes our future results difficult to predict. 
 Our quarterly results of operations, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin, and profitability, may vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We also have a limited operating history and make pricing and other changes from time to time, all of which make it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance. 
 Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include, without limitation, those listed below: 
 our ability to attract new employers and job seekers; 
 Paid Employer renewal rates; 
 Paid Employers purchasing upsell services; 
 the addition or loss of large Paid Employers, including through acquisitions or consolidations; 
 the timing of recognition of revenue; 
 the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; 
 network outages or security breaches; 
 general economic, industry and market conditions, including inflationary pressures, a volatile interest rate environment, increasing borrowing costs, actual or perceived instability in the global banking industry and the impacts therefrom, cybersecurity incidents, the U.S. presidential and other federal, state and local elections, and the impacts of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; 
 changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; 
 seasonal variations in sales of our products, which have historically been most pronounced in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year; 
 the timing and success of new product or service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors or strategic partners; and 
 the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies. 
 Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of the ZipRecruiter brand. 
 We believe that our brand is important to attracting and retaining both employers and job seekers. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide a compelling job marketplace, including services, features, content, and support related to our marketplace, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the ZipRecruiter mark, our logo, and other trademarks important to our brand. While we constantly measure the expected returns of specific sales and marketing initiatives and adjust spend levels up or down accordingly, it is not certain that these and any future investments have had or will have sufficient positive impact on our brand awareness, and any reduction in our levels of investments in brand awareness may harm our brand awareness. We believe that the importance of our brand will increase as competition further intensifies and brand promotion activities may require substantial expenditures. Our brand could be harmed if we cannot achieve these objectives or if our public image were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Unfavorable publicity about us could diminish confidence in our marketplace and 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 services. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the volume, engagement and loyalty of our employers and job seekers and could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 If we are not able to provide successful enhancements, and new products, services, and features, our business could be adversely affected. 
 The market for job-posting marketplaces is characterized by frequent product and service introductions and enhancements, changing user demands, and rapid technological change. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively and timely to these changes. We invest substantial resources in researching and developing new products and services and enhancing our marketplace by incorporating additional features, improving functionality, and adding other improvements to meet our employers and job seekers evolving demands in our highly competitive industry. If we cannot provide enhancements and new features or services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and the competitive landscape, our business could be adversely affected. The success of any enhancements or improvements to, or new features of, our marketplace or any new products and services depends on several factors, including timely completion, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with new and existing technologies in our marketplace and third-party partners technologies, overall market acceptance, and resulting user activity that is consistent with the intent of such products or services. We cannot be sure that we will succeed, either timely or cost effectively, in developing, marketing, and delivering enhancements or new features, products and services to our marketplace that respond to continued changes in the market for job placement services, nor can we be sure that any enhancements or new features to our existing or any new products and services will achieve market acceptance or produce the intended effect. In addition, if new technologies emerge that allow our competitors to deliver similar services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete. 
 Additionally, because our marketplace operates on a variety of third-party systems and platforms, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our offerings to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, operating systems, cloud computing infrastructure, and other software, communication, browser and open source technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Parts of the technology stack supporting our marketplace may also become difficult to maintain and service as there become fewer software engineers who are skilled with respect to the programming languages used to build such pieces of software. Any failure of our marketplace to operate effectively with future network systems and technologies could reduce the demand for our marketplace, result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business. 
 Issues with the use of artificial intelligence (including machine learning) in our marketplace may result in reputational harm or liability, or could otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 Artificial intelligence, or AI, is enabled by or integrated into some of our marketplace and is a significant element of our business. As with many developing technologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient, of poor quality, or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and end-users of our systems or elsewhere (including the integration or use of third-party AI tools) could impair the acceptance of AI solutions and could result in burdensome new regulations that may limit our ability to use existing or new AI technologies. If the recommendations, forecasts, or analyses that AI applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subject to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their purported or real impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be new laws or regulations concerning the use of AI. It is possible that certain governments may seek to regulate, limit, or block the use of AI in our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect or impair the usability or efficiency of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely. 
 The forecasts of growth of online recruitment may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at a similar rate, if at all. 
 Growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not ultimately be accurate and are not under our control. The forecasts relating to the expected growth of the online recruitment market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market experiences the growth we forecast, we may not grow our business at a similar rate, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, any forecasts of market growth included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be taken as indicative of our future growth. 
 The growth of our marketplace depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with our Job Distribution Partners and Job Acquisition Partners. 
 To grow our business and the number of job seekers and employers in our marketplace, we anticipate that we will continue to depend, in part, on relationships with Job Distribution Partners and Job Acquisition Partners. Job Distribution Partners are third-party sites who have a relationship with us and advertise jobs from our marketplace, and include job boards, newspaper classifieds, search engines, social networks, talent communities and resume services, while Job Acquisition Partners are third-party sites and ATSs who have a relationship with us and from whom we receive jobs for our marketplace. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to these Job Distribution Partners to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce engagement with our marketplace. In addition, acquisitions of our Job Distribution Partners or Job Acquisition Partners by our competitors could reduce the number of our current and potential employers and job seekers as well as the number of job postings accessible by our marketplace. We cannot guarantee that the Job Distribution Partners and Job Acquisition Partners with which we have strategic relationships will continue to offer the services for which we rely on them, devote the resources necessary to expand our reach, or support an increased number of employers and job seekers and associated use cases. Further, some of our Job Distribution Partners and Job Acquisition Partners offer, or could offer, competing products and services or also work with our competitors. They may also choose to develop alternative products and services in addition to, or in lieu of, our marketplace, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors. 
 While these relationships have not generated substantial revenue in recent periods and are not expected to generate substantial revenue in the future, they are strategically important in ensuring an appropriate balance of and interaction between jobs and job seekers in our marketplace. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with our Job Distribution Partners and Job Acquisition Partners, or if such Job Distribution Partners or Job Acquisition Partners choose to end their relationships with us, our ability to compete with our competitors and grow our marketplace could be impaired and our operating results may be negatively impacted. 
 Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed. 
 We believe that our corporate culture has been a key contributor to our success. If we do not continue to develop our corporate culture as we grow and evolve, it could harm our ability to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe that we need to support our growth. As our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures, we may find it increasingly difficult 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively impact our future success. Furthermore, our restructuring plan enacted in May 2023 may result in increased attrition beyond our intended reduction in force, reduce employee morale, and negatively impact employee recruiting and retention. If we fail to attract new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed. 
 Additionally, our hybrid working environment may impede our ability to foster a creative environment and adversely affect the productivity of our team members and overall operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. Our return-to-work approach may change at any time, and may vary among geographies. 
 Technological advances may significantly disrupt the labor market and weaken demand for human capital at a rapid rate. 
 Our success is directly dependent on our employers demands for talent. As technology continues to evolve, more tasks currently performed by people may be replaced by automation, robotics, AI, including machine learning, and other technological advances outside of our control. This trend poses a risk to the job posting and distribution industry as a whole, particularly in lower-skill job categories that may be more susceptible to such replacement. 
 Our business is seasonal. 
 Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical behavior in hiring markets, where hiring activity tends to decelerate in the fourth quarter. Such seasonality also causes our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the overall job market. This seasonality can make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately. 
 We track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. 
 We track certain performance metrics, including Quarterly Paid Employers and Revenue per Paid Employer, which are not independently verified by any third party. Our internal tools have a number of limitations and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we report. If the internal tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data (or the data that we measure) may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. While we periodically implement new or enhanced information systems in order to better manage our business operations, align our global organizations and enable future growth, implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to our business operations. If we do not successfully implement information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, we may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, including our ability to effectively aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage our business. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, user base, or traffic levels if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, our reputation may be harmed, we may be subject to legal or regulatory actions, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.

 We derive substantially all of our revenue from job advertisements. 
 We derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of products and services related to the distribution of job advertisements to job seekers across the internet. As such, any factor adversely affecting the sale of these products and services, including market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, intellectual property claims, legal or regulatory restrictions, and economic and market conditions, could harm our business and operating results. 
 Failure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our user base and achieve broader market acceptance of our services. 
 Our ability to increase our Paid Employer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our marketplace will depend significantly on our ability to continue to expand our sales and marketing operations. We plan to continue to expand our sales force and to dedicate significant and increasing resources to sales and marketing programs. We are expanding our sales and marketing capabilities to target additional potential Paid Employers, including some larger organizations, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting and maintaining these businesses as users, and even if we are successful, these efforts may divert our resources away from and negatively impact our ability to attract and maintain our current Paid Employer base. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. If we cannot find efficient ways to deploy our marketing spend or to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel in numbers required to maintain and support our growth, if our new sales personnel cannot achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our ability to increase our Paid Employer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our services could be harmed. 
 Paid Employers may demand more configuration and integration services, or customized features and functions that we do not offer, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Our current and future Paid Employers may demand more configuration and integration services, which would increase our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts, with no guarantee that these Paid Employers will increase their use of our services. As a result of these factors, we may need to devote a significant amount of sales support and professional services resources to individual Paid Employers, which may increase the cost and time required to complete sales. If prospective Paid Employers require customized features or functions that we do not offer, and that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves, then the market for our marketplace will be more limited and our business could suffer. As a result, we may need to devote resources to continue to develop features and technology which may impact our operating results. 
 Any failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our Paid Employers and our financial results. 
 Once our products and services are deployed, our Paid Employers depend on our technical support organization to assist Paid Employers with service support and optimization, and resolve technical issues. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our services and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing Paid Employers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective Paid Employers, and our business, operating results and financial position.

 We have incurred net losses in the past, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and may not sustain profitability. 
 While we earned net income of 49.1 million, 61.5 million, and 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, we have incurred significant net losses in the past, including net losses of 2.6 million and 2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 7.6 million. We expect to incur additional expenses in connection with legal, accounting, and other administrative expenses related to operating as a public company in addition to ongoing stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of our RSUs. Additionally, we expect to make significant future expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business, including investing in our technology to improve our marketplace and investing in sales and marketing channels to enhance our brand promotion efforts. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. If our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to maintain profitability in future periods. As a result, we may generate losses. We cannot ensure that we will continue to achieve profitability in the future or that we can sustain profitability. 
 We rely on Amazon Web Services, or AWS, to host our marketplace, and any disruption of service from AWS or material change to our arrangement with AWS could adversely affect our business. 
 We currently host our marketplace and support most of our operations using AWS, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not control the operations of AWS s facilities. AWS s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures, and similar events or could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. The occurrence of any of these events, a decision to close the facilities or cease or limit providing services to us without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions to our marketplace, which may be lengthy. Our marketplace s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success and employers and job seekers may become dissatisfied by service interruption. Sustained or repeated system failures could reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace to employers and job seekers, cause employers and job seekers to decrease their use of or stop using our marketplace, and adversely affect our business. Moreover, negative publicity from disruptions could damage our reputation. 
 AWS does not have an obligation to renew its agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot renew our agreement or are unable to renew on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure or other data center. If these providers charge high costs for or increase the cost of their services, we will experience higher costs to operate our business and may have to increase the fees to use our marketplace and our operating results may be adversely impacted. 
 Upon expiration or termination of our agreement with AWS, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete. Switching our operations from AWS to another cloud or other data center provider would also be technically difficult, expensive, and time consuming. 
 Many people are using mobile devices to access the internet. If we cannot optimize our websites for mobile access or offer a compelling mobile app, we may not remain competitive and could lose employers and job seekers. 
 Many employers and job seekers access our marketplace through our mobile website and job seekers also have the ability to access our marketplace through our mobile app. We must ensure that the 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 experience for our mobile offerings is optimized to ensure a positive experience. It requires us to develop and enhance our offerings to be specifically designed for mobile devices, such as social media job postings. If we cannot optimize our websites and apps cost effectively and improve the monetization capabilities of our mobile services, we may not remain competitive, which may negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 Additionally, there is no guarantee that job seekers will use our mobile app rather than competing marketplaces. We are dependent on the interoperability of our mobile app with popular third-party mobile operating systems such as Apple s iOS and Google s Android, and their placement in popular app stores like the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and any changes in such systems that degrade our apps functionality or give preferential treatment or app store placement to competitive apps could adversely affect the access and usage of our apps on mobile devices. If it is more difficult for employers and job seekers to access and use our app on their mobile devices, our growth and engagement levels could be harmed. 
 We face risks associated with having operations and employees located in Israel. 
 A significant portion of our technology team is located in Israel. As a result, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. In October 2023, Hamas conducted several terrorist attacks in Israel resulting in ongoing war throughout the country, as well as significant military activity, loss of life, casualties, damage to property in the region, and the temporary closure of our office in Israel for several days. In addition, some of our employees located in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces, and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances, including the war against Hamas and other terrorist or military organizations which have subsequently engaged in hostilities with Israel. We cannot assess the impact that emergency conditions in Israel and any escalation or broadening thereof may have on our business, operations, financial condition or results of operations, but the impact of such conditions could be material. For example, instability in the region could directly impact our ability to operate our business (or any local contractors ability to operate their businesses) or cause international currency markets to fluctuate. Additionally, if a significant portion of our employees located in Israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time, or if international political instability and geopolitical tensions continue or increase in the greater Middle East region, our operations, including the development and launch of additional products or services, may be disrupted, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 If we or our third-party partners or vendors experience a security breach, such as a hacking or phishing attack, or other data privacy or security incident, our marketplace may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our marketplace may be reduced, our operations may be disrupted, we may incur significant legal costs or liabilities, and our business could be adversely affected. 
 Our business involves the storage, processing, and transmission of proprietary, confidential, and personal information as well as the use of third-party partners and vendors who also store, process, and transmit such user information. We also maintain certain other proprietary and confidential information relating to our business and personal information of our personnel. We have previously experienced multiple data security incidents involving the unauthorized access to personal information of job seekers utilizing our services (including their resumes) as well as affecting our business clients accounts, some of which have required us to notify affected individuals and/or regulators. Although upon detection of these security incidents we immediately investigate them and have taken steps to reinforce our security practices and enhance our security monitoring and controls, there are no assurances that other data security incidents will not occur in the future. These incidents and any future data security breach, such as a hacking or phishing attack, or other data privacy or security incident, whether intentionally or unintentionally caused by us or by third parties, that we experience could result in: unauthorized access 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 to, misuse of, or unauthorized acquisition of our, our personnel s, or our users data the loss, corruption, or alteration of this data interruptions in our operations or damage to our computers or systems or those of our users. Any of these could expose us to claims, litigation, fines, other potential liability, and reputational harm. 
 An increasing number of online services have also disclosed security breaches, some of which involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, and as our profile and name recognition increase, we may be targeted more frequently. Additionally, malware, viruses, social engineering (including business email compromise), and general hacking in our industry have become more prevalent and more complex. Further, due to the shift to remote and hybrid work, there is an increased risk that we may experience cybersecurity related incidents, including breaches of information systems security, as a result of our employees, service providers, and third parties working remotely on less secure systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not foreseeable or recognized until launched against a target, we and our third-party partners and vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our third-party partners or vendors security or privacy or other data privacy or security incident occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and brand could be harmed, and we could lose users and business. 
 Data security breaches and other data privacy and security incidents may also result from non-technical means, for example, through human error. Any such security compromise could result in a violation of applicable data privacy, security, breach notification and other laws, regulatory or other governmental investigations, enforcement actions, litigation, and legal and financial exposure, including potential contractual liability. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against, and to address issues created by, security breaches and other privacy and security incidents. These liabilities may exceed the amounts covered by our insurance or our insurance coverage may not extend to or be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, or our insurance may not continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any such compromise could also result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures. Our systems, and the systems of our third-party partners and vendors, may also be vulnerable to computer viruses and other malicious software, physical or electronic break-ins, or weakness resulting from intentional or unintentional service provider actions, and similar disruptions that could make all or portions of our website or applications unavailable for periods of time. Any of these effects could adversely impact our business. 
 We face payment and fraud risks that could adversely impact our business. 
 Requirements in our marketplace relating to user authentication and fraud detection are complex. If our user authentication and fraud detection measures are not effective, our marketplace may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted. In addition, bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized or fraudulent use of another s identity, payment information, or other information misrepresentation of the user s identity or skills, including using accounts that they have purchased, sold, or leased and acquisition or use of credit or debit card details and bank account information. This conduct in our marketplace could result in any of the following, each of which could adversely impact our business: 
 bad actors may use our marketplace, including our payment processing and disbursement methods, to engage in unlawful or fraudulent conduct, such as identity theft, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sale of services, bribery, breaches of security, leakage of data, piracy or misuse of software and other copyrighted or trademarked content, and other misconduct 
 we may be held liable for the unauthorized use of an account holder s credit card or bank account number and required by card issuers or banks to return the funds at issue and pay a chargeback or return fee, and if our chargeback or return rate becomes excessive, credit card networks may 
 57

 also require us to pay fines or other fees and the California Department of Business Oversight may require us to hold cash reserves 
 we may be subject to additional risk and liability exposure, including for negligence, fraud, or other claims, if employees or third-party service providers fraudulently misappropriate our banking or other information or user information 
 employers and job seekers that are subjected or exposed to the unlawful or improper conduct of other employers and job seekers or other third parties, or law enforcement or administrative agencies, may seek to hold us responsible for the conduct of employers and job seekers, lose confidence in our marketplace, decrease or cease use of our marketplace, seek to obtain damages and costs, or impose fines and penalties 
 we may be subject to additional risk if employers in our marketplace cannot pay hired job seekers for services rendered, as such job seekers may seek to hold us responsible for the employers conduct and may lose confidence in our marketplace, decrease or cease use of our marketplace, or seek to obtain damages and costs and 
 we may suffer reputational damage as a result of the occurrence of any of the above. 
 Despite measures we have taken to detect, prevent, and mitigate these risks, we do not have control over the employers and job seekers in our marketplace and cannot ensure that any of our measures will stop or minimize the use of our marketplace for, or to further, illegal or improper purposes. We may receive complaints from employers, job seekers and other third parties concerning misuse of our marketplace and wrongful conduct of other employers and job seekers. We may also bring claims against employers and job seekers and other third parties for their misuse of our marketplace in the future. Even if these claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the attention and resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Changes in laws or regulations relating to data privacy or the protection, collection, storage, processing, transfer, or use of personal data, or AI, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or our privacy policies, could adversely affect our business. 
 We receive, collect, store, process, transfer, and use personal information and other user data. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection, AI (including machine learning), information security, and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content. The scope of these laws and regulations is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries or between U.S. states, or conflict with other laws and regulations. 
 We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, AI, and information security. The regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and AI worldwide is uncertain and complex, and these or other actual or alleged obligations may be interpreted and applied in ways we do not anticipate or that are inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Further, any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding the collection, use, processing, retention, security, or disclosure of the data of our employers and job seekers, employees, contractors, or others, or their interpretation, or any changes regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of employers and job seekers for the collection, use, processing, retention, or disclosure of such data must be obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and features, which may be material or not cost-effective, and may limit our storage and processing of user data or develop new services and features. 
 We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, AI, and information security proposed and enacted in various 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 jurisdictions. For example, in 2018, European legislators adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which imposes more stringent European Union, or EU, data protection requirements, and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR has been and will continue to be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and may subject us to governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines and penalties, claims, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any European activities. Further, the United Kingdom, or the UK, has enacted the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, or DPA, retains the GDPR in UK national law. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR and the UK data protection regime are significant (e.g., fines for certain breaches of the GDPR or the UK GDPR are up to the greater of 20 million Euros (or 17.5 million GBP under the UK GDPR) or 4 of total global annual turnover). 
 Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which afforded new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, came into force in 2020, and also provides for fines for noncompliance. The California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, or CPRA, which took effect on January 1, 2023, further expanded the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements and rights for California consumers, and established a new regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements and issuing additional rulemaking, including with respect to cybersecurity audits, risk assessment, and automated decisionmaking technology. Comprehensive privacy legislation has also been enacted in more than one-third of U.S. states (with several states going into effect in the near future) and each imposes similar, but not identical, compliance obligations. In addition, several data privacy proposals (including proposed comprehensive legislation) are pending before U.S. federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, which may impose significant obligations and restrictions. The effects of these laws are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply, and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. Moreover, several U.S. jurisdictions are looking to regulate specific uses of AI. For example, New York City currently regulates the use of automated employment decision tools by employers and employment agencies, Utah regulates disclosures for the use of generative AI, and Colorado will soon regulate the use of high-risk AI. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR, the UK GDPR, the DPA, the CCPA, AI regulation, and others may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business. As a result, we may need to modify the way we treat, process, or store such information. 
 Further, in July 2023, the SEC adopted new cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies that require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management in Annual Reports on Form 10-K and the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents in Current Reports on Form 8-K within four business days of determining an incident is material. 
 Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to employers and job seekers, employees, contractors, or other third parties, or any other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection, AI, or information security may result in governmental and regulatory investigations or enforcement and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), orders to cease or change our processing of our data, litigation, claims (including representative actions and other class action type litigation, where individuals have suffered harm), or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our employers and job seekers to lose trust in us, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with such laws, regulations and policies may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our marketplace.

 Failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. 
 We have voluntarily implemented policies and procedures designed to allow us to comply with U.S. economic sanctions laws and prevent our marketplace from being used to facilitate business in countries or with persons or entities included on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and equivalent foreign authorities. We may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal, state or local regulators, in the event that we engage in any conduct, intentionally or not, that facilitates money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit activity, or that violates sanctions or otherwise constitutes sanctionable activity. 
 Regulators continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures that we use to verify the identity of our users and to monitor our marketplace for potential illegal activity. In addition, any policies and procedures that we implement to comply with OFAC regulations may not be effective, including in preventing users from using our services within the OFAC-sanctioned countries of North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Iran, Russia, and the breakaway regions of Ukraine (which currently include Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk), or additional countries or regions that may be included from time-to-time. Given the technical limitations in developing controls to prevent, among other things, the ability of users to publish in our marketplace false or deliberately misleading information or to develop sanctions-evasion methods, it is possible that we may inadvertently and without our knowledge provide services to individuals or entities that have been designated by OFAC or are located in a country subject to an embargo by the United States that may not be in compliance with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. 
 Consequences for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include fines, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny. In addition, any perceived or actual breach of compliance by us, our employers and job seekers, or payment partners with respect to applicable laws, rules, and regulations could have a significant impact on our reputation and could cause us to lose existing employers and job seekers, prevent us from obtaining new employers and job seekers, cause other payment partners to terminate or not renew their agreements with us, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by violations and to avert further violations, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability, all of which may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 We are also subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. 201, the U.S. Travel Act, and the UK Bribery Act 2010, and may be subject to other anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and sanctions laws in countries in which we conduct activities or have employers and job seekers. The FCPA prohibits providing, offering, promising, or authorizing, directly or indirectly, anything of value to government officials, political parties, or political candidates for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. The provisions of the Bribery Act extend beyond bribery of government officials and create offenses in relation to commercial bribery including private sector recipients. The provisions of the Bribery Act also create offenses for accepting bribes in addition to bribing another person. We face significant risks if we cannot comply with the FCPA, the Bribery Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. We have implemented an anti-corruption compliance policy, but we cannot ensure that all of our employees, employers and job seekers, and agents, as well as those contractors to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies or agreements and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. 
 Any violation of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, other applicable anti-corruption laws, and other laws could result in investigations and actions by federal or state attorneys general or foreign regulators, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil fines and penalties or other sanctions, forfeiture of significant 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 assets, debarment from government contracts, whistleblower complaints, and adverse media coverage, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action or internal investigation related to alleged misconduct may result in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. 
 We are subject to a wide variety of foreign and domestic laws. As we look to expand our international footprint over time and as new domestic laws are implemented, we may become obligated to comply with additional laws and regulations of the countries or markets in which we operate or have employers and job seekers. 
 We and our employers and job seekers are subject to a wide variety of foreign and domestic laws. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues that may affect us, such as employment, payments, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, AI, benefits, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, unfair competition, terms of service, website accessibility, modern slavery obligations, background checks, and escheatment are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, and, as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies. Many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet, mobile, and related technologies. Other laws and regulations in response to internet, mobile, and related technologies may also be adopted, implemented, or interpreted to apply to us and other online services marketplaces or our users. Likewise, these laws affect our users, and their application, or uncertainty around their application, may affect demand for our marketplace. 
 Further, in June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its longstanding approach under the Chevron doctrine, which provided for judicial deference to regulatory agencies. As a result of this decision, we cannot be sure whether there will be increased challenges to existing agency regulations or how lower courts will apply the decision in the context of other regulatory schemes without more specific guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court s decision could significantly impact consumer protection, advertising, privacy, artificial intelligence, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering practices and other regulatory regimes with which we are required to comply. 
 New approaches to policymaking and legislation may also produce unintended harms for our business, which may impact our ability to operate our business in the manner in which we are accustomed. Any of these regulations could negatively impact our users, including perceptions regarding their use of our marketplace, or have a material adverse effect on the demand for job postings in our marketplace or on how we operate our marketplace. 
 As we look to expand our international footprint over time, we may become obligated to comply with additional laws and regulations of the countries or markets in which we operate or have customers or job seekers. We may be harmed if we are found to be subject to new or existing laws and regulations or if those laws are interpreted and applied to us in a manner that harms our business or is inconsistent with the application of U.S. laws, including with respect to those subjects mentioned above. In addition, contractual provisions that are designed to protect and mitigate against risks, including terms of service, arbitration and class action waiver provisions, disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liabilities, releases of claims, and indemnification provisions, could be deemed unenforceable as to the application of these laws and regulations by a court, arbitrator, or other decision-making body. If we cannot comply with these laws and regulations or manage the complexity of global operations and support an international user base successfully or cost effectively, or if these laws and regulations are deemed to apply to our users or cause a decline in demand for our marketplace, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

 We plan to expand our international operations which could subject us to additional costs and risks, and our continued expansion internationally may not be successful. 
 We plan to expand our operations internationally in the future. Outside of the United States, we currently have operations in the United Kingdom, Israel, and Canada. There are significant costs and risks inherent in conducting business in international markets, including: 
 establishing and maintaining effective controls at foreign locations and the associated costs; 
 adapting our marketplace to non-U.S. employers and job seekers preferences and customs; 
 increased competition from local providers; 
 longer sales or collection cycles in some countries; 
 compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including data privacy frameworks like the GDPR, UK GDPR and DPA; 
 adapting to doing business in other languages or cultures; 
 compliance with local tax regimes, including potential double taxation of our international earnings, and potentially adverse tax consequences due to U.S. and foreign tax laws as they relate to our international operations; 
 compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the FCPA and the Bribery Act; 
 currency exchange rate fluctuations and related effects on our operating results; 
 economic and political instability in some countries; 
 the uncertainty of obtaining and protecting intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad; and 
 other costs of doing business internationally. 
 These factors and other factors could harm our international operations and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Further, we may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our international expansion, and it may not be successful. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in new markets. We also have more limited brand recognition in certain parts of the world, leading to delayed acceptance of our marketplace by international employers and job seekers. If we cannot continue to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our marketplace, disrupt our communication processes, and adversely affect our business. 
 In order to use our marketplace, employers, job seekers, and, to a lesser extent, other third parties including advertisers, partners, and our own employees, entrust us to collect, use, and store their personal information. Our ability to leverage this information and to effectively and efficiently provide our services, including by communicating electronically and otherwise with employers and job seekers of our marketplace, is critical to our business. By way of example, our services may include the sending and receiving of emails, SMS/text messages, in-platform messages, and push notifications on mobile devices. Certain federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, and others are considering adopting, or may adopt in the future, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, transfer, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers, customers, 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 employees, and other individuals, and the conditions under which businesses may communicate with such individuals and other third parties. A determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practices under communications-based laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), could also expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In addition, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our employers and job seekers may limit the use of our marketplace and reduce overall demand, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. Moreover, third-party gatekeepers and service providers and their interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, rules, regulations, and best practices, may limit, disrupt, or require alteration of our operations, service offerings, and ability to communicate with and among employers and job seekers, and may adversely affect our business. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory disputes, and governmental investigations that could cause us to incur significant expenses, divert our management s attention, and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions), government investigations, arbitrations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy (including claims that the collection or provision of certain information, including personal information, by us or by third parties with whom we interact breached laws or regulations relating to privacy or data protection), consumer protection, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters that could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. The outcome of any legal proceeding, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the merits, pending or future legal proceedings could result in a diversion of management s attention and resources and reputational harm, and we may be required to incur significant expenses defending against these claims or pursuing claims against third parties to protect our rights. If we do not prevail in litigation, we could incur substantial liabilities. We may also determine in certain instances that a settlement may be a more cost-effective and efficient resolution for a dispute. 
 Where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that it is probable, we record a related liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate. However, because of uncertainties relating to litigation, the amount of our estimates could be wrong as determining reserves for pending legal proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to judgment calls. The results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and determining reserves for pending litigation and other legal and regulatory matters requires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business. Any adverse determination related to legal proceedings or a settlement agreement could require us to change our technology or our business practices in costly ways, prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to pay monetary damages, fines, or penalties, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows, harm our reputation, or otherwise negatively impact our business. 
 Our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights, or claims by others that we are infringing upon or unlawfully using their intellectual property, could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
 Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, or IPR. We currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our IPR. We currently do not own any patents. We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies and related processes. To protect our proprietary 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors, commercial partners, and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We cannot be certain that the steps taken by us to protect our IPR will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others. Additionally, the process of obtaining protection for trademarks and other IPR is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to apply for all necessary or desirable trademark and other IPR applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent or trademark protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications or apply for all necessary or desirable trademark applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Moreover, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our IPR as fully as in the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the unauthorized use of our IPR by other parties in these countries. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our IPR, and our failure or inability to obtain or maintain IPR protection or otherwise protect our IPR could adversely affect our business. 
 We may in the future be subject to patent infringement and trademark claims and lawsuits in various jurisdictions, and we cannot be certain that our products or activities do not violate the patents, trademarks, or other IPR of third-party claimants. Companies in the technology industry and other patent, copyright, and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and frequently commence litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the likelihood of IPR claims against us has grown and will likely continue to grow. 
 Further, from time to time, we may receive letters from third parties alleging that we are infringing upon their IPR or inviting us to license their IPR. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties or claims that our collection of information from third-party sites without a license violates certain federal or state laws or website terms of use. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability, prevent us from selling some of our products and services, or require us to change our branding. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties at a significant expense, or cease using those rights altogether. We may in the future bring claims against third parties for infringing our IPR. Costs of supporting such litigation and disputes may be considerable, and there can be no assurances that a favorable outcome will be obtained. Patent infringement, trademark infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us or brought by us, whether successful or not, could require significant attention of our management and resources and have in the past and could further result in substantial costs, harm to our brand, and have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our employers and job seekers, which could increase the costs of our services and adversely impact our business. 
 The application of federal, state, local and international tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect), and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. 
 In addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our employers and job seekers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our employers and job 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 seekers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our employers and job seekers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. 
 Furthermore, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes a 1 non-deductible excise tax on the fair market value of any stock repurchased by a publicly traded domestic corporation during any taxable year, with the fair market value of such repurchased stock reduced by the fair market value of certain stock issued by such corporation during such taxable year. This tax applies to our share repurchase program beginning in 2023, where such program is described in the below risk factor titled Our share repurchase program could affect the price of our Class A common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our Class A common stock. 
 Other Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, public health crises, including pandemics, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism. 
 Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, public health crises such as global pandemics, and similar events. Additionally, the third-party systems and operations, such as the data centers and online services we use in our company operations, are subject to similar risks. Our insurance policies may not cover losses from these events or may provide insufficient compensation that does not cover our total losses. To the extent a significant public health threat, or the related macroeconomic impacts, has an impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, it is likely also to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section. Such events have impacted, and could in the future impact, demand for products sold in our marketplace, which in turn could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could also cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. A significant portion of our technology team is located in Israel, which is located in a region of the world that historically has experienced elevated levels of geopolitical instability (see We face risks associated with having operations and employees located in Israel above for additional information regarding risks related to our operations in Israel). Our corporate offices and our primary data center facilities are located in California, a state that frequently experiences earthquakes and wildfires. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans. As we rely heavily on our data center facilities, computer and communications systems, and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality user service, these disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business. 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 
 We had 550.0 million of indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness) and 287.6 million available under our credit facility as of September 30, 2024. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including: 
 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations; 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; 
 requiring a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; and 
 increasing our cost of borrowing. 
 In addition, the credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indenture governing the 550.0 million aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes that we issued in January 2022 contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement that governs our credit facility or the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness. 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. 
 If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. 
 Further, the credit agreement governing our credit facility contains, and any future credit facility or other debt instrument may contain, provisions that will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. 
 If we cannot make the scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, the lenders under our credit facility and the holders of the senior unsecured notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under such credit facility, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in an adverse impact to your investment in our company. 
 Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted. 
 We entered into a Credit Agreement with the lenders named therein, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, in April 2021, which provides for a 290.0 million secured line of credit. We also entered into an indenture in January 2022, which governs the senior unsecured notes. The credit facility and the indenture that governs the senior unsecured notes contain various restrictive covenants, 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 including, among other things, net leverage ratio requirements, and restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make distributions to our stockholders, or enter into certain types of related party transactions. These restrictions may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry, or take future actions. Pursuant to the credit agreement, we granted the lenders thereto a security interest in substantially all of our assets. See the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information. 
 Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be impacted by events beyond our control and we may be unable to do so. Our credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes provides that our breach or failure to satisfy certain covenants constitutes an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under its debt agreements to be immediately due and payable, and holders of the senior unsecured notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable. In addition, the lender would have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the credit agreement. If the debt under our credit agreement or the senior unsecured notes were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay such debts, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, liquidity, and financial condition. 
 We may engage in merger and acquisition activities, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business, and adversely affect our operating results. 
 As part of our business strategy, we may make investments in other companies, products, or technologies. For example, in July 2024, we acquired 100 of the outstanding share capital in Breakroom. Additionally, at any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may result in unforeseen or additional operating difficulties, risks, and expenditures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions in the future, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by employers and job seekers. In addition, if we cannot successfully integrate such acquisitions, including the Breakroom acquisition, or the assets, technologies or personnel associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized. Additionally, we may be exposed to unknown or additional risks and liabilities. 
 We may in the future seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses, products, technologies, or other assets. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our marketplace or our ability to provide our marketplace in foreign jurisdictions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing, or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time consuming, difficult, and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close. Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from their primary responsibilities, dilute our corporate culture, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses, and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. We may not successfully evaluate or use the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition, result in dilution to our stockholders or increase our fixed obligations. 
 We may require additional capital to support business growth and objectives, and this capital might not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, and may result in stockholder dilution. 
 We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, we intend to continue to make 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 investments to support our business growth and may require additional capital to fund our business and to respond to competitive challenges, including the need to promote and enhance our marketplace, develop new products and services, enhance our operating infrastructure, and potentially to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Our inability to obtain additional funding when needed could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, holders of our Class A common stock could suffer significant dilution, and any new shares we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of our Class A common stock. Additionally, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are available for future sale pursuant to stock options, RSUs, or issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. 
 The requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial and management systems, may strain our resources, divert management s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the rules and regulations of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and strains our financial and management systems, internal controls, and employees. 
 The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Moreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to make a formal assessment and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have not identified any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during 2023, 2022 and 2021. However, to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting to meet the standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, additional and potentially significant resources and management oversight may be required. 
 Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on our stock price. 
 The new rules and regulations applicable to public companies, and stockholder litigation brought against recently public companies, have made it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or similar coverage. 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 Our management team has limited experience managing a public company. 
 Most members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. We are subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. 
 If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity/deficit, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. 
 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our operating results and financial condition. 
 Transactions generated in countries other than the United States as well as those incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries. As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars. Our financial results are also subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in non-local currencies. To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange fluctuations and, as a result, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by such fluctuations. 
 Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock 
 Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our Class A common stock and could subject us to litigation. 
 Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The price of our Class A common stock also could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the risk factors described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and others beyond our control, including: 
 the number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock publicly owned and available for trading; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition, operating results and other operating and non-GAAP metrics; 
 69 

Table of Contents 

 our actual or anticipated operating performance and the operating performance of our competitors; 
 changes in the projected operational and financial results we provide to the public or our failure to meet those projections; 
 any major change in our board of directors, management, or key personnel; 
 the impact of, including but not limited to, market volatility and macroeconomic conditions such as inflation and any recession; 
 rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, new products, services, features, integrations or capabilities, acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; 
 lawsuits threatened or filed against us; 
 other events or factors, including those resulting from a pandemic, war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, or responses to these events; and 
 sales or expected sales of our Class A common stock by us, and our officers, directors, and principal stockholders. 
 Furthermore, the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies and financial services and technology companies in particular. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. 
 The dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to our listing, including our directors, executive officers, and 5 stockholders. This ownership will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. 
 Our Class B common stock has twenty votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of September 30, 2024, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock beneficially owned approximately 23.2 of our outstanding common stock as a class and held approximately 85.8 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a class. Because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a substantial majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earliest of (1) the first business day falling on or after 180 days after the date on which Ian Siegel beneficially owns less than 4,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, (2) the date which is (a) 90 days after the date of death or disability of Mr. Siegel or (b) such later date, not to exceed a total period of 180 days after the date of death or disability of Mr. Siegel, as may be approved prior to the date that is 90 days after the date of death or disability of Mr. Siegel by a majority of our independent directors then in office, and (3) the first business day falling on or after the date on which Mr. Siegel elects to convert all then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock. This concentrated control limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. 
 Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain permitted transfers, including certain transfers to family members, trusts solely for the benefit of the stockholder or their family members, affiliates under common control with the stockholder, and partnerships, corporations, and other entities exclusively owned by the stockholder or their family members, in each case as fully described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. 
 The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock. 
 Several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock. 
 Our share repurchase program could affect the price of our Class A common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our Class A common stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 550.0 million of our common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, or pursuant to one or more Rule 10b5-1 plans, in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other investment opportunities. Approximately 25.8 million remains available for future repurchases under our 550.0 million share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. 
 Repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect the price of our Class A common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of our share repurchase program could also cause the price of our Class A common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could reduce the market liquidity for our Class A common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our share repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to further develop our business and service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our Class A common stock price. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term price fluctuations could reduce the program s effectiveness. 
 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business or our future prospects, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market, and our competitors. We do 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 not have control over these securities analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or cannot publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline. 
 We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by the restrictions under the terms of our credit agreement. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. 
 Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition, or other change of control of our company that the stockholders may consider favorable. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that: 
 provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; 
 permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships; 
 require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, including provisions relating to the classified board, the size of the board, removal of directors, special meetings, actions by written consent, and designation of our preferred stock; 
 authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; 
 provide that only the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our lead independent director, or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; 
 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; 
 prohibit cumulative voting; 
 provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders; 
 provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they

 own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets; 
 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 
 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and 
 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 
 Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or DGCL, may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock. See the section titled Description of Class A Common Stock in Exhibit 4.6 to the 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. In addition, under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, if certain change of control events occur, each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount of such notes. Additionally, our credit facility provides for an event of default upon the occurrence of certain specified change of control events. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated bylaws contain exclusive forum provisions for certain claims, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 
 Moreover, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and our amended and restated bylaws provide that the U.S. federal district courts will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision. Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and neither the exclusive forum provision nor the Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities will be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal 
 73 

Table of Contents 

 Forum Provision. These provisions may limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

 If Landlord is not furnishing any particular work or service (the cost of which, if performed by Landlord, would be included in Operating Expenses) to a tenant who has undertaken to perform such work or service in lieu of the performance thereof by Landlord, Operating Expenses shall be deemed to be increased by an amount equal to the additional Operating Expenses which would reasonably have been incurred during such period by Landlord if it had at its own expense furnished such work or service to such tenant. If the Project is not 100 occupied during all or a portion of any Expense Year (including, without limitation, if any portion of the Project is unleased or is leased, but is not then being used by a tenant in the ordinary course of its business), Landlord shall make an appropriate adjustment to the variable components of Direct Expenses for such Expense Year by employing sound real estate accounting and management principles, consistently applied, to determine the amount of Direct Expenses that would have been incurred had the Project been 100 occupied and the amount so determined shall be deemed to have been the amount of Direct Expenses for such Expense Year. For purposes hereof, cost savings in components of Operating Expenses arising by reason of the cessation of use by tenants at the Project due to Casualty (as defined in Section 11.1 below), Force Majeure (as defined in Section 29.13 below), or other extraordinary circumstances are considered variable Operating Expenses that shall be grossed up in Operating Expenses.

In no event shall each of the components of Direct Expenses for any Expense Year related to utility costs, Tax Expenses, or Project insurance costs be less than each of the corresponding components of Direct Expenses related to such utility costs, Tax Expenses, and Project insurance costs in the Base Year Any refunds or discounts actually received by Landlord for any category of Operating Expenses shall reduce Operating Expenses in the applicable Expense Year (pertaining to such category of Operating Expenses). In the event any facilities, services or utilities used in connection with the Project are provided from another building owned or operated by Landlord or vice versa, the costs incurred by Landlord in connection therewith shall be allocated to Operating Expenses by Landlord on a reasonably equitable basis. Except for the management fee permitted pursuant to Section 4.2.3 above, Landlord shall not (i) make a profit by charging items to Operating Expenses that are otherwise also charged separately to others and (ii) subject to Landlord's right to adjust the components of Operating Expenses described above in this paragraph, collect Operating Expenses from Tenant and all other tenants in the Building in an amount in excess of what Landlord incurs for the items included in Operating Expenses. In addition, all assessments and premiums which are not specifically charged to Tenant because of what Tenant has done, which can be paid by Landlord in installments, shall be paid by Landlord in the maximum number of installments permitted by law (except to the extent inconsistent with the general practice of the Comparable Buildings in the vicinity of the Building) and shall be included as Operating Expenses in the year in which the assessment or premium installment is actually paid.

In the event Landlord incurs costs or expenses associated with or relating to any insurance premium resulting from any new forms or types of insurance, including earthquake insurance, which were not part of Operating Expenses during the entire Base Year, Operating Expenses for the Base Year shall be deemed increased by the amounts Landlord would have incurred during the Base Year with respect to such costs and expenses had such insurance been included in Operating Expenses during the entire Base Year. In the event that the earthquake, terrorism or flood insurance premium (or any other insurance premium) applicable to the Building shall decrease in any Expense Year subsequent to the Base Year, Operating Expenses attributable to the Base Year shall, commencing in the year of such decrease, but only so long as and to the extent such decrease remains in effect, thereafter be reduced by the amount of such decrease in earthquake, terrorism or flood insurance premiums (or any other insurance premium).

 4.2.4.2 In General .

Except as set forth in Section 4.2.4.4 below, refunds of Tax Expenses shall be credited against Tax Expenses and refunded to Tenant regardless of when received, based on the Expense Year to which the refund is applicable, provided that in no event shall the amount to be refunded to Tenant for any such Expense Year exceed the total amount paid by Tenant as an increase in Tax Expenses under this Article 4 for such Expense Year. All special assessments which may be paid in installments shall be paid by Landlord in the maximum number of installments permitted by law and not included in Tax Expenses except in the year in which the assessment is actually paid provided, however, that if the prevailing practice in Comparable Buildings is to pay such assessments on an early basis, and Landlord pays the same on such basis, such assessments shall be included in Tax Expenses in the year paid by Landlord. If Tax Expenses for any period during the Lease Term or any extension thereof are increased or decreased after payment thereof for any reason, including, without limitation, error or reassessment by applicable governmental or municipal authorities, Tenant shall pay Landlord, within thirty (30) days following written demand by Landlord, Tenant's Share of any such increased Tax Expenses included by Landlord as Tax Expenses pursuant to the TCCs of this Lease, or Landlord shall provide Tenant with a credit against Rent next coming due under the Lease in the amount of Tenant's Share of any such decreased Tax

Expenses included by Landlord as Tax Expenses pursuant to the terms of the Lease (until such amount has been fully credited to Tenant), as the case may be. 
 4.2.4.3 Exclusions .

 4.2.4.4 Adjustments to Tax Expenses . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Lease, the amount of Tax Expenses for the Base Year shall be calculated without taking into account any decreases in real estate taxes obtained in connection with Proposition 8, and, therefore, the Tax Expenses in the Base Year and or an Expense Year may be greater than those actually incurred by Landlord, but shall, nonetheless, be the Tax Expenses due under this Lease provided that (i) any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in securing any Proposition 8 reduction shall not be included in Direct Expenses for purposes of this Lease, and (ii) tax refunds under Proposition 8 shall not be deducted from Tax Expenses, but rather shall be the sole property of Landlord. This Section 4.2.4.4 is not intended to in any way affect (A) the inclusion in Tax Expenses of the statutory two percent (2.0 annual maximum allowable increase in Tax Expenses (as such statutory increase may be modified by subsequent legislation), or (B) the inclusion or exclusion of Tax Expenses pursuant to the terms of Proposition 13, which shall be governed pursuant to the terms of Sections 4.2.4.1 through 4.2.4.3 , above. 
 4.3 Allocation of Direct Expenses . Subject to Section 4.2.3 above, Landlord shall have the right, from time to time, to reasonably, equitably and consistently allocate some or all of the Direct Expenses for the Project among different portions or occupants of the Project (the Cost Pools ), in Landlord's reasonable discretion. Such Cost Pools may include, but shall not be limited to, the office space tenants, retail space tenants, tenants leasing storage space, and tenants with exclusive use of certain other areas of the Project. Subject to Section 4.2.3 above, the Direct Expenses within each such Cost Pool shall be allocated and charged to the tenants within such Cost Pool in an equitable and consistent manner. The Building is a part of a multi-building project and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Project (the Direct Expenses) generally, as opposed to the Building or another building in the Project specifically, are shared between the tenants of the Building and the tenants of the other buildings in the Project. For any Direct Expenses that are attributable to the Project as a whole, an equitable portion of such Project-wide Direct Expenses (as reasonably, consistently, and equitably determined by Landlord) shall be allocated to the tenants of the Building (as well as the tenants of the other buildings in the Project) and such portion shall be included in the Direct Expenses for purposes of this Lease. For purposes of allocating Direct Expenses, those Direct Expenses not reasonably attributable exclusively to the Building shall be allocated on a rentable area basis, except where otherwise dictated by prudent commercial property management and accounting practices or to achieve an equitable and customary allocation of Direct Expenses, provided that, in either case, such method of allocation is consistent with standard industry practice. For avoidance of doubt, the Direct Expenses for purposes of this Lease shall include all Direct Expenses attributable solely to the Building and an equitable portion of the Direct Expenses attributable to the Project as a whole, but shall exclude any costs and expenses that are attributable solely to another building in the Project. 
 4.4 Calculation and Payment of Tenant's Share of Direct Expenses .

furnish the Statement for any Expense Year shall not prejudice Landlord (provided that in the event that such failure continues for a period of three (3) months following receipt of notice from Tenant, Tenant may elect to seek specific performance) or Tenant from enforcing its rights under this Article 4 . Even though the Lease Term has expired and Tenant has vacated the Premises, when the final determination is made of Tenant's Share of Direct Expenses for the Expense Year in which this Lease terminates, if an Excess is present, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Statement, pay to Landlord such amount, and if Tenant paid more as Estimated Excess than the actual Excess, Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days, deliver a check payable to Tenant in the amount of the overpayment or apply such overpayment against any unpaid Rent. The provisions of this Section 4.4.1 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Tenant shall not be responsible for Tenant's Share of any Direct Expenses attributable to any Expense Year which are first billed to Tenant more than two (2) calendar years after the earlier of the expiration of the applicable Expense Year or the Lease Expiration Date, provided that in any event Tenant shall be responsible for Tenant's Share of Direct Expenses which (x) were levied by any governmental authority or by any public utility companies, and (y) Landlord had not previously received an invoice therefor and which are currently due and owing (i.e., costs invoiced for the first time regardless of the date when the work or service relating to this Lease was performed), at any time following the Lease Expiration Date which are attributable to any Expense Year (provided that Landlord delivers Tenant a bill (a Supplemental Statement for such amounts within two (2) years following Landlord's receipt of the bill therefor).

The failure of Landlord to timely furnish the Estimate Statement for any Expense Year shall not preclude Landlord from enforcing its rights to collect any Additional Rent under this Article 4 (provided that in the event that such failure continues for a period of six (6) months following receipt of notice from Tenant, Tenant may elect to seek specific performance), nor shall Landlord be prohibited from revising any Estimate Statement or Estimated Excess theretofore delivered to the extent necessary provided, however, any such subsequent revision shall set forth on a reasonably specific basis any particular expense increase. Thereafter, Tenant shall pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Estimate Statement, a fraction of the Estimated Excess for the then-current Expense Year (reduced by any amounts paid pursuant to the second to last sentence of this Section 4.4.2 ). Such fraction shall have as its numerator the number of months which have elapsed in such current Expense Year, including the month of such payment, and twelve (12) as its denominator. Until a new Estimate Statement is furnished (which Landlord shall have the right to deliver to Tenant at any time), Tenant shall pay monthly, with the monthly Base Rent installments, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1 12) of the total Estimated Excess set forth in the previous Estimate Statement delivered by Landlord to Tenant. Throughout the Lease Term Landlord shall maintain records with respect to Direct Expenses in accordance with sound real estate management and accounting practices, consistently applied. 
 4.4.3 Cap on Controllable Expenses . Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Controllable Operating Expenses, as that term is defined below, for the Base Year and each Expense Year thereafter increase by more than five percent (5 per Expense Year on a cumulative, compounded basis, except as a result of a change in the physical size of the Premises. For example, the maximum amount of Controllable Operating Expenses that may be included in the calculation of such Operating Expenses for each calendar year shall equal the product of the Controllable Operating Expenses and the following percentages for the following calendar years 105 for the first year following the Base Year 110.25 for the second year following the Base Year 115.76 for the third year following the Base Year 121.55 for the fourth year following the Base Year etc. However, any increases in Operating Expenses not recovered by Landlord due to the foregoing limitation shall be carried forward into succeeding calendar years during the Lease Term (subject to the foregoing limitation) to the extent necessary until fully recouped by Landlord. Upon the commencement of the first Option Term (or any other extension of the initial Lease Term), the measuring Expense Year shall be reset to be the first Expense Year of such Option Term commences (which shall be deemed the Base Year for the Option Term). As used herein Controllable Operating Expenses shall mean all Operating Expenses, excluding the following (i) utility charges, (ii) janitorial expenses, (iii) the cost of union labor, including payroll and benefits, which shall include labor which is not union as of the Lease Date but which unionizes after the Lease Date, (iv) market-wide labor-rate increases due to extraordinary circumstances, including without limitation, boycotts and strikes, (v) costs incurred due to an event of Force Majeure and other weather-related costs (including landscape maintenance costs, such as those resulting from infestation, storms, drought and other severe weather), (vi) Landlord's insurance costs and deductibles thereunder, (vii) costs relating to compliance with governmentally mandated transportation management

 4.5.1 Tenant shall be liable for taxes levied against Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures and any other personal property located in or about the Premises and shall pay or dispute (to the extent lawful so to do) the same before delinquency. If any such taxes on Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures and any other personal property are levied against Landlord or Landlord's property or if the assessed value of Landlord's property is increased by the inclusion therein of a value placed upon such equipment, furniture, fixtures or any other personal property and if Landlord pays the taxes based upon such increased assessment, which Landlord shall have the right to do regardless of the validity thereof but only under proper protest if requested by Tenant, Tenant shall with thirty (30) days following demand by Landlord the taxes so levied against Landlord or the proportion of such taxes resulting from such increase in the assessment, as the case may be. 
 4.5.2 Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein Landlord may elect to charge Tenant directly, and in such event Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days of demand, as Additional Rent, any or all of the following (i) rent tax or sales tax, gross receipts tax, service tax, transfer tax or value added tax, and or any other applicable tax on the rent or services herein or otherwise respecting this Lease, (ii) any taxes assessed upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion of the Project, including the Parking Facilities, and taxes or assessments due to any type of ballot measure, including an initiative adopted by the voters or a local agency, or a state or municipal proposition approved by the voters and (iii) taxes assessed upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises. To the extent that Landlord elects to charge Tenant directly for any of the foregoing, then such items for which Tenant is so charged directly shall not be included in Direct Expenses. 
 4.5.3 Landlord may charge Tenant the estimated amount of taxes and other charges for which Tenant is directly responsible pursuant to this Section 4.5 on a monthly basis, provided that Landlord shall reconcile the amount actually paid by Tenant with the amount that Tenant should have paid, as part of Landlord's Statement following the end of each Expense Year. 
 4.6 Landlord's Records . 
 4.6.1 In General . Subject to the TCCs of Section 4.2.6 below, within one (1) year after Tenant's receipt of a Statement for a particular Expense Year and, with respect to the Base Year, within one (1) year following receipt of a Statement for the first Expense Year following the Base Year (the Audit Period ), if Tenant disputes the calculation of Direct Expenses set forth in such Statement, an independent certified public accountant designated and paid for by Tenant Tenant's Accountant ), may after reasonable notice to Landlord and at reasonable times, audit Landlord's records (the Tenant Review with respect to the Statement. In no event shall Tenant have the right to conduct such Tenant Review if Tenant is then in default under this Lease with respect to any of Tenant's monetary obligations, including, without limitation, the payment by Tenant of all Additional Rent amounts described in the Statement which is the subject of Tenant's Review, which payment, at Tenant's election, may be made under dispute. Tenant's Accountant must (A) be a member of a nationally or regionally recognized certified public accounting firm which has previous experience in auditing financial operating records of landlords of office buildings, (B) not be retained on a contingency fee basis (i.e., Tenant must be billed based on the actual time and materials that are incurred by Tenant's Accountant in the performance of the audit), and (C) not currently or within the previous twenty-four (24) month period be providing accounting and or lease administration services to another tenant in the Project in connection with a review or audit by such other tenant of Direct Expenses.

ability of Tenant's Accountant to perform the audit in a reasonable manner, and shall execute a commercially reasonable confidentiality agreement regarding the Tenant Review. In connection with the foregoing review, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with such reasonable supporting documentation relating to the subject Statement or Supplemental Statement as Tenant may reasonably request. Any audit report prepared by Tenant's Accountant shall be delivered concurrently to Landlord and Tenant within the Audit Period. If after such audit, Tenant still disputes such Direct Expenses, an audit to determine the proper amount shall be made, at Tenant's expense, by an independent certified public accountant (the Neutral Accountant mutually selected by Landlord and Tenant that has not previously represented Landlord or Tenant provided that if such audit by the Neutral Accountant proves that the Direct Expenses in the subject Expense Year were overstated by more than three percent (3 ), then the cost of the Neutral Accountant and the out-of-pocket cost of Tenant's Accountant shall be paid for by Landlord. If Landlord and Tenant cannot agree upon and appoint a Neutral Accountant within thirty (30) days of Tenant's submittal of an audit report to Landlord, then Landlord or Tenant may apply to the Presiding Judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court to appoint a Neutral Accountant in accordance with the criteria herein. If the resolution of the parties' dispute with regard to the Additional Rent shown on the Statement (as determined by Tenant Review and accepted by Landlord, or as determined by the Neutral Accountant, if applicable) reveals an error in the calculation of Tenant's Share of Direct Expenses to be paid for such Expense Year, the parties' sole remedy shall be for the parties to make appropriate payments or reimbursements, as the case may be, to each other as are determined to be owing. Any such payments shall be made within thirty (30) days following the resolution of such dispute provided that if Landlord fails to make such payment within such time period, Tenant may treat any overpayments resulting from the foregoing resolution of such parties' dispute as a credit against Rent until such amounts are otherwise paid by Landlord. Subject to the terms of Section 4.6.2 , below, this provision shall survive the termination of this Lease to allow the parties to enforce their respective rights hereunder. 
 4.6.2 Termination of Rights . Tenant's failure to audit the Direct Expenses set forth in any Statement within the Audit Period shall be deemed to be Tenant's approval of such Statement and Tenant, thereafter, waives the right or ability to audit the amounts set forth in such Statement provided, however, that, that in no event shall the foregoing constitute a waiver by Tenant to pursue any fraud claims against Landlord pertaining to Direct Expenses to the extent allowable under Applicable Laws. Additionally, if following Tenant's delivery to Landlord of a written request for a Tenant Review, Landlord fails to make its accounting records for the applicable Expense Year reasonably available for such purpose in accordance with the terms of Section 4.6.1 above, then the Audit Period shall be extended one (1) day for each day that Tenant and or Tenant's Auditor, as the case may be, is so prevented from accessing such accounting records. In no event shall the payment by Tenant of any Direct Expense payment, or any amount on account thereof, preclude Tenant from exercising its rights under this Section 4.6 . Tenant's sole right to audit Landlord's records and to contest the amount of Direct Expenses with respect to any Expense Year shall be as expressly set forth in this Section 4.6 , and Tenant hereby waives any and all other rights pursuant to Applicable Laws to audit such records and or to contest the amount of Direct Expenses with respect to any Expense Year. 
 4.7 Tenant's Proposition 13 Protection Period . During the period beginning on (i) January 1, 2027 (i.e. the day after the end of the Base Year) and ending on the last day of Lease Year 1, Tenant shall not be obligated to pay any of the Tax Increase (defined below) with respect to the entire Premises leased by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, (ii) the first day of Lease Year 2 and ending on the last day of Lease Year 2, Tenant shall not be obligated to pay sixty-six percent (66 of any Tax Increase with respect to the entire Premises leased by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, and (iii) the first day of Lease Year 3 and ending on the last day of Lease Year 3, Tenant shall not be obligated to pay thirty-three percent (33 of any Tax Increase with respect to the entire Premises leased by Tenant pursuant to this Lease. Tenant shall be fully responsible for any Tax Increase (regardless of when such Tax Increase occurred) arising after the expiration of the Protection Period, including any extension of the Lease Term. The Protection Period is the period from January 1, 2027 through the earlier of (a) the last day of Lease Year 3 and (b) the date, if any, that the terms of Proposition 13 are no longer applicable to the Property. 
 4.7.1 Tax Increase . The Tax Increase is that portion of the Tax Expenses, as calculated immediately following the Reassessment (defined below), which is attributable solely to the Reassessment. The Tax Increase shall not include any portion of the Tax Expenses, as calculated immediately following the Reassessment, which is attributable to (i) the assessed value of the Premises, Building or Project or the tenant improvements located therein prior to the Reassessment, (ii) assessments which were pending immediately prior to the Reassessment which assessments were conducted during, and included in, such Reassessment, or which assessments were otherwise rendered unnecessary following the Reassessment, (iii) the annual inflationary increase of real estate taxes, but not in excess of 2.0 per annum, (iv) is attributable to Tax Expenses incurred during the Base Year (calculated without regard to the effect of Proposition 8) or (v) any tax, assessment or reassessment that is not pursuant to the terms of Proposition 13.

by the appropriate governmental authority pursuant to the terms of Proposition 13 to the extent resulting from the consummation of any sale, refinancing, or change in ownership (whether in full or in part) of the Project. 
 4.7.2 Landlord's Right to Purchase the Proposition 13 Protection Amount . The amount of Tax Expenses which Tenant is not obligated to pay or will not be obligated to pay in connection with a particular Reassessment shall be sometimes referred to hereafter as a Proposition 13 Protection Amount . If the occurrence of a Reassessment is reasonably foreseeable by Landlord and the Proposition 13 Protection Amount attributable to such Reassessment can be reasonably quantified or estimated for each calendar year commencing with the calendar year in which the Reassessment will occur, the terms of this Section 4.7.2 shall apply to each such Reassessment. Upon notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have the right to purchase the Proposition 13 Protection Amount relating to the applicable Reassessment (the Applicable Reassessment ), at any time during the Protection Period, by paying to Tenant an amount equal to the Proposition 13 Purchase Price, as that term is defined below, provided that the right of any successor of Landlord to exercise its right of repurchase hereunder shall not apply to any Reassessment which results from the event pursuant to which such successor of Landlord became the Landlord under this Lease. The Proposition 13 Purchase Price is the present value of the Proposition 13 Protection Amount remaining during the Protection Period, as of the date of payment of the Proposition 13 Purchase Price by Landlord. Such present value shall be calculated (i) by using the portion of the Proposition 13 Protection Amount attributable to each remaining calendar year (as though the portion of such Proposition 13 Protection Amount benefitted Tenant at the middle of each calendar year), as the amounts to be discounted, and (ii) by using discount rates for each amount to be discounted equal to (A) the average rates of yield for United States Treasury Obligations with maturity dates as close as reasonably possible to the middle of each calendar year during which the portions of the Proposition 13 Protection Amount would have benefitted Tenant, which rates shall be those in effect as of Landlord's exercise of its right to purchase the Proposition 13 Protection Amount, plus (B) 1 per annum. Upon such payment of the Proposition 13 Purchase Price, the provisions of this Section 4.7 shall not apply to any Tax Increase attributable to the Applicable Reassessment. Since Landlord is estimating the Proposition 13 Purchase Price because a Reassessment has not yet occurred, then when such Reassessment occurs, if Landlord has underestimated the Proposition 13 Purchase Price, then upon notice by one party to the other, Tenant's Rent next due shall be credited with the amount of such underestimation, and if Landlord overestimates the Proposition 13 Purchase Price, then upon notice by Landlord to Tenant, Rent next due shall be increased by the amount of the overestimation shall be due within thirty (30) days.

The TCCs of this Section 15.3 have been specifically bargained for, and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Tenant expressly waives the right to receive any notices under California Civil Code Section 1993 et seq., or any other statutory procedures with respect to abandoned personal property.

The use, application, or retention of the L-C proceeds, or any portion thereof, by Landlord shall not prevent Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy provided by this Lease or by any Applicable Laws, and Landlord shall not first be required to proceed against the L-C, and such L-C or the proceeds thereof shall not operate as a limitation on any recovery to which Landlord may otherwise be entitled. No condition or term of this Lease shall be deemed to render the L-C conditional to justify the issuer of the L-C in failing to honor a drawing upon such L-C in a timely manner.

The new L-C shall comply with all terms and conditions of this Article 21 . If, as a result of any drawing by Landlord on the L-C pursuant to an L-C Draw Event, the amount of the L-C shall be less than the L-C Amount, Tenant shall, within ten (10) business days after written notice thereof from Landlord, provide Landlord with (i) an amendment to the L-C restoring such L-C to the L-C Amount or (ii) an additional L-C in an amount equal to the deficiency, which additional L-C shall comply with all of the provisions of this Article 21 .

Tenant has no right to assign or encumber the L-C or any part thereof and neither Landlord nor its successors or assigns will be bound by any such assignment, encumbrance, attempted assignment or attempted encumbrance. In the event of an assignment by Tenant of its interest in the Lease (and irrespective of whether Landlord s consent is required for such assignment), the acceptance of any replacement or substitute letter of credit by Landlord from the assignee shall be subject to Landlord s prior written approval, in Landlord s sole and absolute discretion. At any time and without notice to Tenant and without first obtaining Tenant s consent thereto, Landlord may transfer (one or more times) all of its interest in and to the L-C to another party, person or entity that has an interest in the Project or this Lease (including any Mortgagee). In the event of a transfer of Landlord s interest in this Lease, Landlord shall transfer the L-C, in whole only, to the transferee and thereupon Landlord shall, without any further agreement between the parties, be released by Tenant from all liability therefor, and it is agreed that the provisions hereof shall apply to every transfer or assignment of the L-C to a new landlord. In connection with any such transfer of the L-C by Landlord, Tenant shall, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, execute and submit to the Bank such commercially reasonable applications, documents and instruments as may be necessary to effectuate such transfer, and Tenant shall be responsible for paying the Bank s transfer and processing fees in connection with the first transfer, provided that Landlord shall have the right (in its sole discretion), but not the obligation, to pay such fees on behalf of Tenant and Landlord shall be responsible for paying the Bank s transfer and processing fees in connection with any subsequent transfer, but not in excess of the transfer fee first paid by Tenant). 
 21.7 L-C Not a Security Deposit . In no event or circumstance shall the L-C, any renewal or substitute therefor or any proceeds thereof be deemed to be or treated as a security deposit under any law applicable to security deposits in the commercial context, including, but not limited to, Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code, as such Section now exists or as it may be hereafter amended or succeeded (the Security Deposit Laws ). The L-C (including any renewal thereof or substitute therefor or any proceeds thereof) is not intended to serve as a security deposit, and the Security Deposit Laws shall have no applicability or relevancy thereto. Landlord and Tenant hereby waive any and all rights, duties and obligations that any such party may now, or in the future will, have relating to or arising from the Security Deposit Laws. Tenant hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code and any successor statute, and all other provisions of law, now or hereafter in effect, which (x) establish the time frame by which a landlord must refund a security deposit under a lease, and or (y) provide that a landlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of rent, to repair damage caused by a tenant or to clean the premises. 
 21.8 Non-Interference By Tenant . Tenant agrees not to interfere in any way with any payment to Landlord of the proceeds of the L-C, prior to a draw by Landlord of all or any portion of the L-C, regardless of whether any dispute exists between Tenant and Landlord as to Landlord s right to draw down all or any portion of the L-C. No condition or term of this Lease shall be deemed to render the L-C conditional and thereby afford the Bank a justification for failing to honor a drawing upon such L-C in a timely manner. Tenant shall not request or instruct the Bank to refrain from paying sight draft(s) drawn under such L-C. 
 21.9 Waiver of Certain Relief . Tenant unconditionally and irrevocably waives (and as an independent covenant hereunder, covenants not to assert) any right to claim or obtain any of the following relief in connection with the L-C 
 21.9.1 A temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, permanent injunction, or other order that would prevent, restrain or restrict the presentment of sight drafts drawn under the L-C or the Bank s honoring or payment of sight draft(s) or 
 21.9.2 Any attachment, garnishment, or levy in any manner upon either the proceeds of the L-C or the obligations of the Bank (either before or after the presentment to the Bank of sight drafts drawn under such L-C) based on any theory whatever.

21.10 Remedy for Improper Drafts . Tenant s sole and exclusive remedy in connection with Landlord s improper draw against the L-C or Landlord s improper application or retention of any proceeds of the L-C shall be the right to obtain from Landlord a refund of the amount of any sight draft(s) that were improperly presented or the proceeds of which were misapplied or wrongfully held, together with interest at the Interest Rate and reasonable actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees, provided that at the time of such refund, Tenant increases the amount of such L-C to the amount (if any) then required under the applicable provisions of this Lease. Tenant irrevocably waives any right to secondary, incidental, indirect or consequential damages in any way related to Landlord s draw on the L-C. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord's draw against the L-C, application or retention of any proceeds thereof, or the Bank s payment under such L-C, could not, under any circumstances, cause Tenant injury that could not be remedied by an award of money damages, and that the recovery of money damages would be an adequate remedy therefor. In the event Tenant shall be entitled to a refund as aforesaid and Landlord shall fail to make such payment within ten (10) business days after demand, Tenant shall have the right to deduct the amount thereof together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the next installment(s) of Base Rent.

 Last Day of 48 th full calendar month of Lease Term 
 250,000.00

As to any matter submitted to arbitration with respect to the payment of money, to determine whether a matter would, with the passage of time, constitute a default, such passage of time shall not commence to run in the event that the party which is obligated to make the payment promptly does in fact make the payment to the other party. Such payment can be made under protest, which shall occur when such payment is accompanied by a good faith notice stating the reasons that the party has elected to make a payment under protest. Such protest will be deemed waived unless the subject matter identified in the protest is submitted to arbitration as set forth in this Section 29.35 .

The parties may agree on a retired judge from the AAA panel (or otherwise).

Prior to providing such list, AAA shall be asked to determine that such retired judges are available, conflict-free and willing to serve as the Arbitrator. Upon receipt of such list, each party may strike three of the retired judges, and then shall rank the remaining three judges in order of preference from one to three (one being highest preference). The parties shall then simultaneously exchange their respective lists. If only one retired judge appears on both lists, that retired judge will serve as the Arbitrator. If more than one retired judge appears on both lists, then the retired judge with the lowest combined score (highest combined preference) will serve as the Arbitrator. If more than one retired judge appears on both lists and each has the same combined score, or if no retired judge appears on both lists, then AAA shall be asked to make a random selection from a combined list of the remaining six retired judges. If the amount in controversy is 250,000 or less, then the AAA shall be asked to provide a list of three retired judges,

 EXTENSION OPTION 
 1. Option Right . Upon the proper exercise of any Extension Option in accordance with the provisions of this Exhibit F , the Lease Term shall be extended for the Option Term. The rights contained in this Exhibit F shall terminate upon Original Tenant's assignment of this Lease, if at all, to any entity other than a Permitted Transferee. Tenant's may not exercise any Extension Option if, at the time of Tenant's delivery of the Exercise Notice (as defined below), or, at Landlord's option, as of the commencement of the Option Term (i) Tenant has received a written notice of a default under this Lease that then remains uncured, (ii) a monetary Event of Default has occurred during more than twice during the preceding twelve (12) months, or (iii) Tenant has assigned this Lease, other than to a Permitted Transferee Assignee. Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to provide new and or additional security in the form of a cash security deposit and or letter of credit based upon Tenant's then financial condition (and in connection therewith, Tenant shall provide the financial information referenced in Section 17.2 of this Lease within ten (10) business days of Landlord's request) if (a) there has been a material adverse change in Tenant's financial condition as compared to Tenant's financial condition as of the Effective Date, (b) Tenant's receipt of a Renewal Allowance or other economic concessions during the Option Term, (c) Tenant's construction, or contemplated construction, of Tenant Improvements or Alterations that have above-standard demolition and removal costs, and which Tenant is obligated to remove upon expiration of the Lease Term, (d) Tenant is involved in a lawsuit, or any other situation exists, that Landlord reasonably believes could materially impair Tenant's ability to perform its obligations under this Lease, or (e) based on financial security then generally being imposed in Comparable Transactions from tenants of comparable financial condition and credit history, as compared to the then existing financial condition and credit history of Tenant (and giving reasonable consideration to Tenant's prior performance history during the Lease Term). 
 2. Option Rent . The Rent payable by Tenant during the Option Term (the Option Rent shall be equal to the Market Rent (as defined below), as derived from an analysis of the Net Equivalent Lease Rates (as defined below) of the Comparable Transactions (as defined below) as of the commencement of the Option Term. The Market Rent shall be equal to the fair market value annual rent per rentable square foot, at which tenants, are, pursuant to transactions consummated within twelve (12) months prior to the commencement of the Option Term, leasing non-sublease, non-equity, non-encumbered space comparable in age, location and quality to the Premises containing a square footage comparable to that of the Premises for a term comparable to the Option Term, in an arm's-length transaction, which comparable space is located in the Project or in Comparable Buildings (transactions satisfying the foregoing criteria shall be known as the Comparable Transactions ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Comparable Transactions shall only include renewal and expansion transactions if negotiated at arms-length, with a tenant represented by a leasing broker, and where such tenant's lease contained fair market rent language materially comparable to the Market Rent definition herein. The terms of the Comparable Transactions shall take into consideration only the following terms and concessions (i) the rental rate and escalations, (ii) the amount of parking rent per parking pass paid, if any, (iii) operating expense and tax protection granted, such as a base year or expense stop, and whether or not tenants are paying any utilities directly, but the base rent for each Comparable Transaction shall be adjusted to a triple net base rent using reasonable estimates of operating expenses and taxes for each such Comparable Transaction (iv) rental abatement concessions, if any, being granted such tenants, (v) any Renewal Allowance (as defined below), to be provided by Landlord in connection with the Option Term as compared to the improvements or allowances provided or to be provided in the Comparable Transactions, taking into account the contributory value of the existing improvements in the Premises, such value to be based upon the age, design, quality of finishes, and layout of the existing improvements, and (vi) all other monetary concessions, if any, being granted such tenants in connection with such Comparable Transactions. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, in determining the Market Rent, no consideration shall be given to (A) any period of rental abatement, if any, granted to tenants in Comparable Transactions in connection with the design, permitting and construction of improvements, or (B) any commission paid or not paid in connection with such Comparable Transaction. In connection with the Extension Option, Tenant shall be granted a 2030 Base Year during the Option Term. 
 2.1 Comparable Buildings . The term Comparable Buildings shall mean first-class multi-tenant or single-tenant occupancy, mid-rise office buildings which are comparable to the Project in terms of age (based upon the date of completion of construction or major renovation), with campus style outdoor areas, institutional ownership, quality of construction, and are located in either (i) the area bound by 20 th Street to the West, the 405 Freeway to the East, the North side of Wilshire Boulevard to the North, and the South side of Ocean Park to the South, and (ii) the project commonly known as the Playa District addressed as 6601, 6701, 6060, 6080 and 6100 Center Drive, Los Angeles,

California 90045 and the area in Playa Vista that is South of the 90 Freeway, North of the South side of Bluff Creek Drive, East of Lincoln and West of the 405 Freeway. 
 2.2 Adjustments to Market Rent . The Market Rent in Comparable Transactions, when compared to the Market Rent for the Premises, shall be adjusted for all factors (to the extent such factors normally affect the rent received by the landlord of the Comparable Buildings) to reflect the existence or non-existence of such factors, including without limitation (i) the stated size of the Premises based upon the standards of measurement to be utilized during the Option Term, as compared to the standards of measurement utilized during the Comparable Transactions (ii) any changes in the Market Rent following the date of any particular Comparable Transaction up to the date of the commencement of the applicable Option Term (iii) rights granted to Tenant for exterior signage and parking signage, reserved parking, flexible parking, and implementation of parking programs as compared to such rights, if any, granted to the tenants in Comparable Transactions and (iv) all of the material differences between the Building and the Comparable Buildings. 
 2.3 Net Equivalent Lease Rate . In order to analyze the Comparable Transactions based on the factors to be considered in calculating Market Rent, and given that the Comparable Transactions may vary in terms of length of term, rental rate, concessions, etc., the following steps shall be taken into consideration to adjust the objective data from each of the Comparable Transactions and this Lease. By taking this approach, a net equivalent lease rate for each of the Comparable Transactions shall be determined using the following steps to adjust the Comparable Transactions, which will allow for an apples to apples comparison of the Comparable Transactions to the terms of this Lease. 
 2.3.1. The contractual rent payments for each of the Comparable Transactions should be arrayed monthly or annually over the lease term. All Comparable Transactions should be adjusted to simulate a net rent structure, wherein the tenant is responsible for the payment of all property operating expenses in a manner consistent with this Lease. This results in the estimate of Net Equivalent Rent received by each landlord for each Comparable Transaction being expressed as a periodic net rent payment. 
 2.3.2 Any free rent or similar inducements received over time should be deducted in the time period in which they occur, resulting in the net cash flow arrayed over the lease term. 
 2.3.3 The resultant net cash flow from the lease should then be discounted (using the Interest Rate as an annual discount rate) to the lease commencement date, resulting in a net present value estimate. 
 2.3.4 From the net present value, up front inducements (improvements allowances and other concessions) should be deducted. These items should be deducted directly, on a dollar for dollar basis, without discounting since they are typically incurred at lease commencement, while rent (which is discounted) is a future receipt. 
 2.3.5 The net present value should then be amortized back over the lease term as a level monthly or annual net rent payment using the same annual discount rate used in the present value analysis. This calculation will result in a hypothetical level or even payment over the option period, termed the Net Equivalent Lease Rate (or constant equivalent in general financial terms). 
 2.3.6 Once the Net Equivalent Lease Rate is calculated for a particular Comparable Transaction, such Net Equivalent Lease Rate can be adjusted if and to the extent that the operating expenses and tax expenses that are the direct (payable directly by tenant) or indirect (payable as a reimbursement by the tenant to the Landlord) obligations of the tenant as though there is no base year or expense stop protection (collectively, the Expenses in connection with a Comparable Transaction are less than or greater than the Expenses payable by Tenant under the Lease during the applicable Option Term (with the same adjustments made to convert this Lease from a Base Year lease, net of electric, to a net lease), so that the Market Rent to be determined pursuant to this Exhibit F will reflect whether, if at all, the Expenses payable by Tenant are greater than or less than the Expenses payable by the tenant of a Comparable Transaction. 
 2.3.7 Once the Net Equivalent Lease Rate is calculated, if the term of a Comparable Transaction is greater than or less than the applicable Option Term, the Net Equivalent Lease Rate will be adjusted to take into account whether or not, based on current market transactions and conditions, the concessions (i.e., tenant improvement allowances and free rent) in the Market Rent should be increased or decreased because of such difference in term, so that the Market Rent will reflect the appropriate level of concessions based on an adjustment of the level of concessions in the Comparable Transactions. For example, if a Comparable Transaction is for an six year term, and the Option Term is for five years, then an adjustment can be made to increase the concessions in the Comparable Transaction 

-2- 
 
 ZipRecruiter 
 Santa Monica Business Park 
 300 Ocean Park Blvd. 

to equate such transaction to an five year term, if such adjustment is warranted by market transactions and conditions. 
 2.3.8 The Net Equivalent Lease Rates for the Comparable Transactions shall then be used to reconcile, in a manner usual and customary for a real estate appraisal process, to a conclusion of Market Rent which shall be stated as a NNN lease rate applicable to each year of the Option Term. 
 2.4 Renewal Allowance . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Exhibit F , once the Market Rent for the Option Term is determined as a Net Equivalent Lease Rate, if, in connection with such determination, it is deemed that Tenant is entitled to an improvement or comparable allowance for the improvement of the Premises (the total dollar value of such allowance shall be referred to herein as the Renewal Allowance ), Landlord shall pay the Renewal Allowance to Tenant pursuant to Landlord's standard, commercially reasonable disbursement procedure, and the rental rate component of the Market Rent shall be increased to be a rental rate which takes into consideration that Tenant will receive payment of such Renewal Allowance and, accordingly, such payment shall be factored into the base rent component of the Market Rent. 
 3. Exercise of Extension Option . The Extension Option(s) shall be exercised by Tenant, if at all, only in the following manner (i) Tenant shall deliver written notice to Landlord not more than fifteen (15) months nor less than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term stating that Tenant may be interested in exercising its option Tenant's Interest Notice (ii) Landlord, after receipt of Tenant's Interest Notice shall deliver notice (the Option Rent Notice to Tenant not less than eleven (11) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term setting forth the Option Rent Landlord's Option Rent Calculation and (iii) if Tenant wishes to exercise such option, whether or not Tenant has delivered the Tenant's Interest Notice, Tenant shall, on or before the date occurring ten (10) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term exercise the option by delivering written notice thereof to Landlord (the Option Exercise Notice ). Upon, and concurrent with, such exercise, Tenant may, at its option, object to the Option Rent contained in the Option Rent Notice, in which case the parties shall follow the procedure, and the Option Rent shall be determined, as set forth in Section 4 below. If Tenant did not deliver the Tenant's Interest Notice, the parties shall follow the procedure, and the Option Rent shall be determined, as set forth in Section 4 , below. In the event that Tenant delivered a Tenant's Interest Notice as provided under the terms set forth in Section 3 , above, Landlord shall deliver an Option Rent Notice to Tenant not less than eleven (11) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term setting forth the Option Rent. 
 4. Determination of Market Rent . In the event Tenant validly objects to or does not accept Landlord's Option Rent Calculation, then Landlord and Tenant shall attempt to agree upon the Option Rent using good-faith efforts provided, however, if they fail to reach agreement upon the Option Rent on or before the date that is ninety (90) days prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the Lease Term (the Outside Agreement Date ), then each party shall make a separate, binding, determination of the Option Rent (each, a Submitted Option Rent ), within ten (10) business days following the Outside Agreement Date, and such Submitted Option Rents shall be submitted to arbitration as described below. The failure of Tenant or Landlord to submit a Submitted Option Rent within such ten (10) business day period shall conclusively be deemed to be such party's approval of the Submitted Option Rent submitted by the other party. 
 4.1 Neutral Arbitrator . Within fifteen (15) days after the Outside Agreement Date Landlord and Tenant shall agree upon and appoint one arbitrator who shall by profession be a, real estate broker (a Neutral Arbitrator who shall have been active over the ten (10) year period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of Comparable Buildings, and (i) neither the Landlord or Tenant may, directly, or indirectly, consult with the Neutral Arbitrator prior or subsequent to his or her appearance, (ii) the Neutral Arbitrator cannot be someone who has represented Landlord (or worked with their counsel on a similar arbitration) and or Tenant (or worked with their counsel on a similar arbitration) during the ten (10) year period prior to such appointment, and (iii) each party may require the Neutral Arbitrator to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the parties that the Neutral Arbitrator has no conflicts of interest with either Landlord or Tenant. 
 4.2 Arbitration Agreement . The Neutral Arbitrator shall be retained via an arbitration agreement (the Arbitration Agreement jointly prepared by Landlord's counsel and Tenant's counsel, which Arbitration Agreement shall set forth the following (i) an agreement to by the Neutral Arbitrator to undertake the arbitration and render a decision in accordance with the TCCs of this Lease, as modified by the Arbitration Agreement (ii) rights for Landlord and Tenant to submit to the Neutral Arbitrator (with a copy to the other party), on or before the date that occurs fifteen (15) days following the appointment of the Neutral Arbitrator, an advocate statement (and any other information such party deems relevant) prepared by or on behalf of Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, in support

of Landlord's or Tenant's respective determination of Market Rent (the Briefs (iii) rights for each party to provide the Neutral Arbitrator (with a copy to the other party), within five (5) business days of submittal of Briefs with a written rebuttal to the other party's Brief (the Rebuttals provided, however, such Rebuttals shall be limited to the facts and arguments raised in the other party's Brief and shall identify clearly which argument or fact of the other party's Brief is intended to be rebutted (iv) the date, time and location of the arbitration, which shall be mutually and reasonably agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant, which date shall in any event be within forty-five (45) days following the appointment of the Neutral Arbitrator (v) that no discovery or independent investigation shall take place in connection with the arbitration, other than to verify the factual information that is presented by Landlord or Tenant, and the Neutral Arbitrator shall be permitted to visit the Project and the buildings containing the Comparable Transactions and (vi) rights for each party to present oral arguments to the Neutral Arbitrator at the arbitration for a period of time not to exceed three (3) hours and up to two (2) additional hours to present additional arguments and or to rebut the arguments of the other party. 
 4.3 Neutral Arbitrator Ruling . Not later than ten (10) business days after the date of the arbitration, the Neutral Arbitrator shall render a decision (the Ruling indicating whether Landlord's or Tenant's Submitted Option Rent is closer to the actual Market Rent. The Submitted Option Rent that is determined by the Neutral Arbitrator to be closer to the actual Market Rent shall then become the applicable Option Rent. The Ruling shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. In the event that the Option Rent has not been determined pursuant to the terms hereof (or otherwise by written agreement between Landlord and Tenant) prior to the commencement of the Option Term, then upon the commencement of the Option Term, Tenant shall be required to pay the greater of (i) the Rent then in effect for the Premises (immediately prior to the commencement of the Option Term), or (ii) Tenant's Submitted Option Rent, until such time that the Ruling is rendered. In such event, once the Ruling has been rendered it shall be effective retroactively to the commencement of the Option Term, and the payments made by Tenant that are applicable to the Option Term shall be reconciled with the actual amounts due (based on the Ruling), and the appropriate party shall make any corresponding payment to the other party within thirty (30) calendar days after the Ruling is rendered.
