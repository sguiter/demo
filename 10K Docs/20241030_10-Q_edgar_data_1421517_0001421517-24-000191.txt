Effective tax rate, excluding discrete items 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the recognized provision for and (benefit from) income taxes, respectively, 
 resulted from the tax projection based on the full year forecasted profit and included benefits related to the U.S. federal foreign-derived 
 intangible income FDII ), federal research and development R D tax credit , certain permanent differences, such as share-based 
 compensation shortfalls, and partial release of California valuation allowance . 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the recognized provision for and (benefit from) income taxes, respectively, 
 included benefits related to the U.S. FDII and federal R D tax credit, along with a discrete tax benefit due primarily to share-based 
 compensation windfalls and prior years discrete tax benefit largely related to increased tax credits. 
 The effective tax rate excluding discrete items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior year, differed 
 primarily due to lower projected R D tax credits, increased non-deductible officer share-based compensation, and lower projected U.S. FDII 
 benefits .

 when operating , we believe our solutions lower costs, save energy, reduce waste, and minimize emissions for companies across a variety of 
 commercial and industrial processes . As the world coalesces around the urgent need to address climate change and its impacts, we are 
 helping companies reduce their energy consumption in their industrial processes, which in turn, reduces their carbon footprint. We believe 
 that our customers do not have to sacrifice quality and cost savings for sustainability and we are committed to developing solutions that drive 
 long-term value both financial and environmental . 
 The original product application of our technology, the PX Pressure Exchanger PX energy recovery device , was a major 
 contributor to the advancement of seawater reverse osmosis desalination SWRO ), significantly lowering the energy intensity and cost of 
 water production globally from SWRO . Our pressure exchanger technology is being applied to the wastewater filtration market, such as 
 battery manufacturers, mining operations, municipalities, and other manufacturing plants that discharge wastewater with significant levels of 
 metals and pollutants, and has also been applied to the development of our PX G1300 for use in the CO 2 market. 
 Engineering, and research and development R D ), have been, and remain, an essential part of our history , culture and corporate 
 strategy. Since our formation, we have developed leading technology and engineering expertise through the continual evolution of our 
 pressure exchanger technology, which can enhance environmental sustainability and improve productivity by reducing waste and energy 
 consumption in high-pressure industrial fluid-flow systems. This versatile technology works as a platform to build product applications and is 
 at the heart of many of our products. In addition, we have engineered and developed ancillary devices, such as our hydraulic turbochargers 
 and circulation booster pumps, that complement our energy recovery device s. 
 
 Segments 
 Our reportable operating segments consist of the water and emerging technologies segments. These segments are based on the 
 industries in which the technology solutions are sold, the type of energy recovery device or other technology sold and the related solution and 
 service or, in the case of emerging technologies, where revenues from new and/or potential devices utilizing our pressure exchanger 
 technology can be brought to market. Other factors for determining the reportable operating segments include the manner in which our Chief 
 Operating Decision Maker CODM ), our President and Chief Executive Officer , evaluates our performance combined with the nature of the 
 individual business activities. In addition, our corporate operating expenses include expenditures in support of the water and emerging 
 technologies segments. We continue to monitor and review our segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to 
 determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact our reportable segments .

Results of Operations 
 A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , is presented below. 
 
 Revenue 
 Variability in revenue from quarter to quarter is typical, therefore year-on-year comparisons are not necessarily indicative of the trend 
 for the full year due to these variations. There is no specific seasonality in our revenues to highlight that occurs throughout a calendar year. 
 
 We generally track our revenues by channels. The channels we recognize and channel definitions we utilize are as follows: 
 Megaproject MPD channel: The MPD channel has been the main driver of our long-term growth as revenue from this channel 
 benefits from a growing number of projects as well as an increase in the capacity of these projects in some cases. MPD projects 
 are large-scale in nature and generally have shipment timelines from 16 to 36 months from contract date. Recognition of 
 revenue is dependent on customers project timing and execution of these projects. 
 Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM channel: The OEM channel reflects sales to a wide variety of industries in the 
 desalination, wastewater, and the refrigeration markets. This channel contains projects smaller in size and revenue, and of 
 shorter duration compared to those projects in the MPD channel. 
 Aftermarket AM channel: The AM channel represents support and services rendered to our installed customer base. AM 
 revenue generally fluctuates from year-to-year and is dependent on our customers timing of product upgrades, as well as their 
 replenishment of spare parts and supplies .

The interim period tax provision for (benefit from) income taxes is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, 
 adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period . Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if 
 the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in such period. The quarterly tax provision and estimate 
 of our annual effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income 
 or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, the applicability of special tax regimes, and changes in how we do business . 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the recognized provision for and (benefit from) income taxes, respectively, 
 resulted from the tax projection based on the full year forecasted profit and included benefits related to the U.S. federal foreign-derived 
 intangible income FDII ), federal R D tax credit , certain permanent differences, such as share-based compensation shortfalls, and partial 
 release of California valuation allowance . 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the recognized provision for and (benefit from) income taxes, respectively, 
 included benefits related to the U.S. FDII and federal R D tax credit, along with a discrete tax benefit due primarily to share-based 
 compensation windfalls and prior years discrete tax benefit largely related to increased tax credits. 
 The effective tax rate excluding discrete items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior year, differed 
 primarily due to lower projected R D tax credits, increased non-deductible officer share-based compensation, and lower projected U.S. FDII 
 benefits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 From time-to-time, management and our Board of Directors review our liquidity and future cash needs and may make a decision to 
 (1) return capital to our shareholders through a share repurchase program or dividend payout; or (2) seek additional debt or equity financing. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of (i) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 63.3 million that are 
 primarily invested in money market funds and U.S. treasury securities ; (ii) investment-grade short-term and long-term marketable debt 
 instruments of 76.7 million that are primarily invested in U.S. treasury securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal and agency 
 notes and bonds ; and (iii) accounts receivable, net of allowances, of 31.8 million . As of September 30, 2024 , there was unrestricted cash of 
 1.1 million held outside the U.S. We invest cash not needed for current operations predominantly in investment-grade, marketable debt 
 instruments with the intent to make such funds available for future operating purposes, as needed. Although these securities are available for 
 sale, we generally hold these securities to maturity, and therefore, do not currently see a need to trade these securities in order to support our 
 liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. We believe the risk of this portfolio to us is in the ability of the underlying companies or government 
 agencies to cover their obligations at maturity, not in our ability to trade these securities at a profit. Based on current projections, we believe 
 existing cash balances and future cash inflows from this portfolio will meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 We entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMC on December 22, 2021 (as amended, the Credit 
 Agreement ). The Credit Agreement , which will expire on December 21, 2026 , provides a committed revolving credit line of 50.0 million and 
 includes both a revolving loan and a letters of credit LCs component. The maximum allowable LCs under the credit line component of the 
 Credit Agreement is 30.0 million . As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement . 
 Under the Credit Agreement , as of September 30, 2024 , there were no revolving loans outstanding. In addition, as of September 30, 
 2024 , under the LCs component, we utilized 18.4 million of the maximum allowable credit line of 30.0 million , which included newly 
 issued LCs, and previously issued and unexpired stand-by letters of credits SBLCs and certain non-expired commitments under the 
 previous Loan and Pledge Agreement with Citibank, N.A., which are guaranteed under the Credit Agreement . As of September 30, 2024 , 
 there was 17.4 million of outstanding LCs. These LCs had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 17 months . 
 See Note 6 , Lines of Credit , of the Notes for further discussion related to the Credit Agreement .

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities is subject to the project driven, non-cyclical nature of our business. Operating cash flow can 
 fluctuate significantly from year to year, due to the timing of receipts of large project orders. Operating cash flow may be negative in one year 
 and significantly positive in the next, consequently individual quarterly results and comparisons may not necessarily indicate a significant 
 trend, either positive or negative. 
 The lower net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the 
 prior year, was due primarily to the following factors : 
 Accounts receivable and contract assets: an increase in cash provided primarily related to an increase in revenues, the timing of 
 billings related to shipments of product or certification of installations, and collections on the account receivable balances; 
 Inventory : an increase in cash used primarily related to the increase in PXs manufactured for project deliveries in the fourth 
 quarter of 2024 and early 2025; and 
 Accrued liabilities : an increase in cash used primarily related to a decreas e in employee compensation and benefits, and a 
 reduction of tax accruals. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to sales, maturities and purchases of investment-grade marketable debt 
 instruments, such as corporate notes and bonds, and capital expenditures supporting our growth. We believe our investments in marketable 
 debt instruments are structured to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing 
 risk. The higher net cash used in investing activities of 3.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior 
 year, was primarily driven by 3.8 million of net cash used for purchases of marketable debt instruments. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the cash provided by 
 financing activities in the prior year, was due primarily to an increase of cash from exercises of employee stock options granted under our 
 equity incentive plans.

Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements 
 We believe that our existing resources and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital 
 requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue 
 to fund our operations or to support acquisitions in the future and/or to fund investments in our latest technology arising from rapid market 
 adoption. These needs could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Our future capital requirements will depend on many 
 factors including the continuing market acceptance of our products, our rate of revenue growth, the timing of new product introductions, the 
 expansion of our R D, manufacturing and S M activities, and the timing and extent of our expansion into new geographic territories. In 
 addition, we may enter into potential material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies in the 
 future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Should we need additional liquidity or capital funds, these funds 
 may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk may be found primarily in two areas, foreign currency and interest rates. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our foreign currency exposures are due to fluctuations in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar USD versus the British pound, Saudi 
 riyal, Emirati dirham, European euro, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Canadian dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely 
 affect our consolidated operating results or financial position. 
 Our revenue contracts have been denominated in the USD. At times, our international customers may have difficulty in obtaining 
 the USD to pay our receivables, thus increasing collection risk and potential bad debt expense. To the extent we expand our international 
 sales, a larger portion of our revenue could be denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, our cash and operating results could be 
 increasingly affected by changes in exchange rates. 
 In addition, we pay many vendors in foreign currency and, therefore, are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our 
 international sales and service operations incur expense that is denominated in foreign currencies. This expense could be materially affected 
 by currency fluctuations. Our international sales and services operations also maintain cash balances denominated in foreign currencies. To 
 decrease the inherent risk associated with translation of foreign cash balances into our reporting currency, we do not maintain excess cash 
 balances in foreign currencies. 
 We have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because expenses in foreign currencies have been 
 insignificant to date and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, we do not 
 have any exposure to the Russian ruble. 
 
 Interest Rate and Credit Risks 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without 
 significantly increasing risk. We invest primarily in investment-grade short-term and long-term marketable debt instruments that are subject 
 to counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, we invest pursuant to an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors. The policy 
 mandates high credit rating requirements and restricts our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our investment portfolio of 88.1 million , in investment-grade marketable debt instruments, such as U.S. 
 treasury securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal and agency notes and bonds , are classified as either cash equivalents or 
 short-term and/or long-term investments on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are subject to interest rate 
 fluctuations and decrease in market value to the extent interest rates increase, which occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 . To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we maintain investments with a weighted average maturity of 
 approximately eight months . As of September 30, 2024 , a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in a less than 
 0.4 million decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable debt instruments as of such date.
