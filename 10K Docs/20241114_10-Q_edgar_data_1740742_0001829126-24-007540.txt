Unicoin Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED Consolidated FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 

 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 

Going Concern 

These condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with United States U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company has incurred net losses of (29,254) thousand and (10,671) thousand and used cash in operating activities of thousand and thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of thousand and thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and expects to incur future additional losses. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s long-term success is dependent upon its ability to successfully raise additional capital, market its existing services, increase revenues, and, ultimately, to achieve profitable operations. 

The Company is evaluating strategies to obtain the required additional funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, issuing Unicoin Rights, obtaining equity financing, issuing debt, or entering other financing arrangements, and restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease expenses. However, in view of uncertainties in U.S. and global financial markets, the Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern. 

Other Events 

On August 9, 2024, the Company detected an unknown
threat actor had gained access to the Company s Google G-Suite account and therefore the Company s G-Suite products (i.e.,
G-Mail, G-Drive and other related G-Suite functionality). The Company previously disclosed that the unknown actor changed passwords and
access to all users having an @unicoin.com email address (the Event ). Upon further investigation, it was
determined that the unknown actor did not in fact change passwords, but rather the Company s IT team disabled all passwords when
the unauthorized access was discovered, and implemented stricter verification and access protocols for its users. On or about August
13, 2024, the Company was able to remove the threat actor s access to the G-Suite accounts and restore access to its internal users.
The Company examined the information accessed to determine and mitigate the impact of the Event, and determined that no data or funds
were accessed or taken from its systems, and therefore the Event was immaterial. The Company determined the following details in connection
with the Event: 

1. 
 Unauthorized access to corporate G-Suite services was gained by unknown persons. 

2. 
 During a personal check of corporate users of internal services, discrepancies were found in the personal data of employees and/or contractors in the Company s accounting department. 

3. 
 Traces of hacked messages and email accounts of certain managers of the Company were found. 

4. 
 Traces of identity forgery of one of the contractors of the Company were found and such contractor subsequently was terminated. 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
the Event has not had a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. To the knowledge of the
Company s management, no traces of loss of any of the Company s cash or crypto assets have been found as a result of the
Event. 

owned, and Unicorns, which is and owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the minority interests are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as non-controlling interests NCI ). 

On February 21, 2024, the Company s majority owned subsidiary, Unicorns, issued common stock shares to an Executive Producer for the Unicorn Hunters show. This issuance was compensation in connection with the completion of Season 1 of the Unicorn Hunters show. This transaction decreased the Company s ownership interest from to . 

On March 11, 2024, Moe Vela sold his entire
ownership in Unicorns of 
common stock shares to the Company, in exchange for 1,500,000 Unicoin Rights. This transaction increased the Company s
ownership interest from 
to .
The Company paid Moe Vela with Unicoin Rights valued at 740 thousand. This transaction was accounted for under the guidance of ASC
810- Consolidations by recording a reduction in the non-controlling interest of 943 thousand, which represents the increase in the
Company s share of the carrying value of Unicorns net assets. The 204 thousand excess of carrying value of Unicorns net
assets over the fair value of the Unicoin Rights paid in consideration was recorded to Additional Paid-In-Capital during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

Certain information and note disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The audited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, included herein, was derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of that date. 

The Company assesses all entities in which it has a significant economic, ownership or other financial interest for consolidation on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each entity. Pursuant to ASC 810, the Company first evaluates whether it holds a variable interest in an entity. The Company considers all economic interests, including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if such interests are considered a variable interest. 

For any entity where the Company has determined that it does hold a variable interest, the Company performs an assessment to determine whether it qualifies as a VIE. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary having the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE as well as the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. 

Management evaluated whether Unicorns meets the criteria for classification as a VIE or as VOE and concluded that Unicorns meets the criteria of a VIE. Management further concluded that the Company is the primary beneficiary of Unicorns because the Company has the power to direct the activities that most affect its economic performance and further has the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. Accordingly, the Company is required to consolidate Unicorns as a VIE. 

thousand and thousand of cash in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured amounts. The bank at which the Company had deposits that exceed FDIC limits is not in receivership or under the control of the FDIC. On July 2024, the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico ordered the liquidation and dissolution of Next Bank International, Inc. Next Bank ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for thousand uninsured deposits held at Next Bank. The Company does not have any other transactions with Next Bank. The Company has not experienced any other losses in relation to amounts not insured by the FDIC. 

As discussed in Note 5, the Company has accepted digital assets as consideration from certain investors in exchange for equity, debt or Unicoin Rights issued by the Company. Digital asset market values are subject to significant fluctuations based on supply and demand for such digital assets and other factors. The Company can either hold, sell, or use digital assets as payment to vendors. Digital asset price risk could adversely affect future operating results including earnings, cash flows and the Company s ability to meet its ongoing obligations.

The Share Exchange Agreement SEA that the Company entered into in order to acquire a majority stake in ITSQuest, as amended on December 28, 2022 (as amended, the Amended SEA ), contains a
contingent divestiture provision whereby if by December 31, 2024, the Company does not either (i) engage in an initial public
offering of its securities at a price of at least 10.00 per share or (ii) cause the Company s proposed security tokens
(unicoins) to become tokenized and listed on a cryptocurrency exchange with a quoted price at or above 1.00 per token, then the
Company will be required to divest itself of the acquired ITSQuest equity by returning the same to the founders of ITSQuest, and
such founders shall be entitled to retain the shares of the Company received pursuant to the SEA. 

As of the filing date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has assessed that it is unlikely it will achieve either of the two trigger
events necessary to avoid divestiture of ITSQuest. If the Company is not able to achieve an initial offering of its Common
Stock or an initial registration of its unicoins, sufficient to meet the criteria outlined in the Amended SEA, or is unable to negotiate an extension with ITSQuest, on or before
December 31, 2024, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity will be materially
impacted as ITSQuest represented Company assets of thousand

On August 28, 2024, the Company notified the public that it is postponing
its initial coin offering ICO of unicoins in order to conduct a thorough review of its public statements, offering materials
and its business in general. The Company anticipates conducting this thorough review of its compliance with applicable regulatory requirements
with the assistance of a leading national law firm. The Company cannot assess at this time the exact length of the review and will work
with outside legal counsel and the appropriate regulators as expeditiously as possible toward a path to continue its efforts and plans
for the launch of unicoins. 

Loss of digital assets and USDC 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company identified
a loss of digital assets and USDC amounting to 8 thousand and 159 thousand, respectively. The Company completed its investigation of
the matter and concluded that related digital assets were misappropriated by an unknown and unauthorized outside party that bypassed
the Company s security procedures and operational infrastructure. The Company has determined it will not be able to recover those
assets. Accordingly, the Company recorded a write-off of 168 thousand within the General and Administrative Expenses line item of the
Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

thousand to-date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Unicorn Hunters non-cash receivables were and thousand, respectively and represented 0 and 39 of total receivables, respectively. In addition, these receivables represented 0 and 5 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company reviews each outstanding customer s non-cash receivable balance with management of the private company customer, and records an allowance for expected credit losses if either of the following are noted: 

a. 
 A specific milestone, equity financing or other event has occurred that is a clear indication that there has been a material change in the enterprise value of the private company customer since the original recording of the Unicorns accounts receivable balance and before the Company has received the underlying stock option, warrants or shares certificates. 

b. 
 The Company s review identifies facts and circumstances that have substantially changed either the private company customers intent or its ability to issue the stock option, warrants or shares certificates due in satisfaction of their related accounts receivable balance. 

To date, the Company has not recorded any credit loss expense or allowance for expected credit losses related to Unicorn Hunters non-cash receivables and the Company has not experienced any fluctuations or significant matters, relating to any of its businesses, that would require recording a material allowance for expected credit losses in any period to date.

As discussed in Note 7, the obligation to settle the Company s Unicoin Rights liability through the exchange of a fixed number of unicoins, when and if all contingencies are resolved and unicoins are launched, represents an embedded feature that may result in additional charges to the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss upon settlement. The embedded feature was initially valued at and is not expected to fluctuate until the unicoin is launched or probable of launch. 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 

As discussed in Notes 2 and 4, consideration from Unicorns customers generally consists of commitments to issue stock options or warrants from customers which appear on the Unicorn Hunters show. This non-cash consideration is recognized in accounts receivable at the estimated fair values at or near the dates of contract inception using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of these commitments, as well as the options or warrants of private companies, held upon settlement of such receivables, as measured using Level 3 inputs, may fluctuate as discussed in Note 4. Certain other items such as goodwill, intangible assets, contingent divestiture and NCI resulting from the ITSQuest acquisition are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs. There are inherent limitations when estimating the fair value of financial instruments, and the fair values reported are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in current market transactions.

Intangible assets were recorded at fair value consistent with the requirements of ASC 805 as a result of the acquisition of ITSQuest. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value measurement of the assets was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows and market comparable data and companies. 

Amortization expense related to intangible assets was thousand and thousand for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was thousand and thousand for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The Company performed its most recent qualitative assessments of goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2023, to determine if the carrying values of these assets exceeded their fair values, noting there were no indicators of impairment for goodwill or intangible assets. 

Digital Assets 

The Company records the initial cost basis of digital assets at their original purchase price or the then-current quoted market prices and presents all digital asset holdings as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , except USDC. The Company performs an analysis to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not that the Company s digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the quoted price of the digital asset. If the then-current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value so determined, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the price determined. 

As of April 1, 2023, the Company has revised its impairment loss assessment methodology for digital assets to record write-downs to the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset (i.e., on a daily basis rather than quarterly). This revision would be consistent with the requirements of ASC 350-30-35-19, which indicates impairment exists whenever carrying value exceeds fair value. It also indicates that after an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset shall be its new accounting basis. Management assessed the potential difference in impairment loss that would have resulted in prior periods if this impairment methodology had been applied retroactively, noting the amounts were immaterial. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 the Company received digital assets and USD Coin as consideration from customers and investors for the purchases of Unicoin
Rights, common stock and private placement unsecured notes issued by the Company. These digital assets included Bitcoin BTC ),

respectively. The Company did not hold any long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Unsecured Notes
bear interest at a rate of per
annum, payable, at maturity, and initially matured one year from issuance unless the holder elects to extend the maturity. 

The Unsecured Notes generally rank pari-passu relative to other unsecured obligations. As follows is a schedule of outstanding balances by the maturity date: 

Interest expense on Unsecured Notes of 
thousand and thousand was incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense on
Unsecured Notes of 
thousand and 
thousand was incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense was recorded as accrued expenses in
the condensed consolidated balance sheet. No significant third-party financing costs were incurred because the Company managed the
issuance of the Unsecured Notes internally, without the use of an underwriter or trustee. Based on their short duration, the fair
value of the Unsecured Notes as of September 30, 2024 approximates their carrying amounts. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, the Company has issued rights to acquire 
billion and 
billion unicoins, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the outstanding financing obligation related to
Unicoin Rights was 
thousand and 
thousand, respectively. The obligation to settle this liability through the exchange of a fixed number of unicoins, when and if all
contingencies are resolved and unicoins are launched, represents an embedded feature that may result in additional charges to the
Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss upon settlement. Although the Company intends
to do so, if it is unable to develop and launch the unicoin, there can be no assurance that the Company can generate sufficient
funds through operations, or through financing transactions on terms acceptable to the Company in order to settle the Unicoin Rights
financing obligation. Due to the currently undetermined rights of unicoin holders, the significant nature of required regulatory
approvals and the likely registration required prior to unicoins achieving liquidity (all of which have aspects whose success is
outside of the Company s control), management initially concluded that the value of the embedded feature is de minimis and
will likely remain de minimis until the unicoin is probable of regulatory approval and launch. Accordingly, the embedded feature was
initially valued at 0 and is not expected to fluctuate until the unicoin is launched or probable of launch. The expected fair value measurement of the embedded feature was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and represent
Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information,
including estimated future cash flows. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
paid operating expenses to employees and service providers by issuing Unicoin Rights with a fair value of thousand and thousand,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid operating expenses to employees and service providers
by issuing Unicoin Rights with a fair value of thousand and thousand, respectively. The related Unicoin Rights Financing
Obligation is included within the Service Providers, Influencers and Employees category of the summary below.

Sales to Investors 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Unicoin Rights financing obligation associated with sales to investors amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. The cumulative amounts were received from completed sales of Unicoin Rights in the Company s various financing rounds at prices ranging from to . Although there are no stated legal rights requiring the Company to return amounts received from investors, management believes the holder of Unicoin Rights has a reasonable right to either 1) receive the number of unicoins specified in their Unicoin Rights agreement upon the future development and launch of the unicoin or 2) a refund of the amount invested in anticipation of the future development and launch of unicoins. Therefore, all amounts received from sales to investors have been recorded as a Unicoin Rights financing obligation. 

Dividend Issued to Shareholders 

The Company declared and issued a non-cash dividend of Unicoin Rights, on a pro-rata basis, to all shareholders of record as of the dividend declaration date of February 10, 2022. This non-cash dividend was the initial issuance of Unicoin Rights, prior to finalizing any plan to market and sell Rights in connection with any of the Company s financing rounds, and at the time of the pro-rata distribution, management and the Board had not yet ascribed a value to such Rights. As a result, the Company has ascribed a de minimis value to all Unicoin Rights issued to shareholders on February 10, 2022. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Unicoin Rights financing obligation associated non-cash dividend of Unicoin Rights amounted to thousand. 

Discretionary Payments to Employees, Contractors and Directors 

The Company has issued Unicoin Rights to certain employees, Board members and external contractors/consultants as discretionary awards. These Unicoin Rights were issued on a discretionary basis and do not indicate that employees, Board members or contractors/consultants are being rewarded with a specific value attributable to past or future services rendered by such individuals. The Unicoin Rights were also not issued as a replacement for, or in lieu of, cash or equity awards due under any type of pre-determined bonus or other incentive plan that quantifies a value that the holders are entitled to as a result of their services or performance. The Company believes that, because of the nature of these discretionary awards (i.e., nothing of specific value was exchanged to the Company in return), together with the legal disclaimer of any obligation to launch the unicoin within the terms of the Unicoin Rights agreement, on a per Unicoin Right basis, the amount that holders would be entitled to if the Unicoin is not ultimately launched is de minimis in relation to the actual fair value per Unicoin Right. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Unicoin Rights financing obligation associated with discretionary payments to employees, contractors and directors amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. 

Issued to Service Providers, Influencers and Employees 

The Company has issued Unicoin Rights in exchange for services from advertising agencies, marketing firms and other vendors. Also, the Company has issued Unicoin Rights as part of the compensation package negotiated with certain employees. The related contracts for these third-party providers and employees specify the value provided, as negotiated by these parties, and the number of Unicoin Rights accepted as compensation for the dollar value of those services. 

Similar to investors, service providers exchanged a specified, negotiated value in exchange for Unicoin Rights and has rights to receive either 1) the negotiated number of unicoins upon development or launch, or 2) payment of cash equivalent to the value of services provided. In addition, from time to time the Company engages Influencers to promote unicoins and/or the Unicorn Hunters show in exchange for Unicoin Rights. The form of Influencer engagement may include promoting unicoin in a social media post, making brief reference in a speech, posting about unicoin on a website or any other media form. 

These contracts do not specify the value of services rendered by Influencer nor the specific format of engagement required. Because an engagement can represent something as simple as brief mention in a speaking engagement, or posting on a social media account, etc. management determined there is very little effort involved by the Influencer in order to perform services in a manner consistent with the contractual terms. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Unicoin Rights financing obligation associated with Unicoin Rights issued to service providers, influencers and employees amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. 

Five-Year Deferred Payment Plan 

In August 2022 the Company began offering a five-year deferred payment plan (the deferred payment plan to investors in its ongoing Unicoin Rights offering. The deferred payment plan permits investors to purchase Unicoin Rights immediately and pay for such Unicoin Rights in five equal annual installments, with the first installment due one year after the date of purchase. Purchases through the deferred payment plan requires that investors provide collateral to the Company having a value of up to 20 of the total purchase price of the purchased Unicoin Rights. Collateral can be in the form of Company common stock owned by the investor, Unicoin Rights already owned by the investor, cash, digital assets or other assets with a demonstrable value, at the Company s discretion, if such assets can be transferred to the Company or a valid lien on such assets can be secured. Pursuant to the terms of the installment payment plan, both the pledged collateral and the Unicoin Rights being purchased under the installment plan will be forfeited to the Company if the investor fails to make any of the five annual installment payments. 

The following table summarizes the pledged collateral pursuant to the deferred payment plan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Real Estate Based on third-party appraisal near the date the real estate was accepted as collateral. 

Ten-Year Prepaid Plan 

In November 2022 the Company began offering
a ten-year prepaid plan (the prepaid plan to investors in its Unicoin Rights offering. Under the prepaid plan,
the investor remits cash or digital asset deposits (the principal for a period of up to ten years. After the first year
(the maturity date ), the investor can either withdraw the principal or apply it towards the purchase of unicoins at 20
cents per unit. Five years after the deposit (the maturity ), the investor earns a cumulative interest of 50 of the principal,
which qualifies toward the withdrawal or purchase of unicoins. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cumulative cash
receipts of 
 thousand and 
 thousand, respectively, were recorded as Unicoin Rights financing obligation in connection with the prepaid plan.
After five years following the deposit (the interest vesting date ), 
 thousand and thousand of these proceeds, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are entitled to earn cumulative (i.e., non-compounded)
interest of 50 , which can either be withdrawn or applied to the purchase of unicoins. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the remaining proceeds of 
 thousand and thousand,
respectively, did not include a contractual interest rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest
recorded within the Unicoin Rights financing obligation amounted to 
 thousand and 
 thousand, respectively. Accrued interest under the prepaid plan has been calculated using the straight-line method, which approximates
the effective interest method. The financing obligation did not include present value adjustments to account for lower than market interest
rate, in relation to those transactions with no contractual interest, as such adjustments would have been immaterial. 

ITSQuest Contingent Divestiture Amendment 

In December 2022, the Company issued 20 million Unicoin Rights to the previous owners of ITSQuest as part of the consideration given in exchange for amending ITSQuest s contingent divestiture provision. A total of thousand was recorded relating to the Unicoin Rights financing obligation associated with these Unicoin Rights. Representing the approximate fair value of the Unicoin Rights at the time of issuance. 

Asset Swap Agreement and Related Commission 

On October 9, 2023, As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an Investment in Land asset in its balance sheet amounting to thousand, the fair value of the land as determined by a third-party appraisal. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a Unicoin Right financing obligation of thousand, which consisted of Unicoin Rights with a fair value of thousand and thousand, which were provided to the seller as consideration and a real estate agent as a commission, respectively. 

On February 9, 2024, 
 Upon exchanging consideration in April 2024, the Company recorded an Investment in Land asset in its balance sheet amounting to
 
 thousand, the fair value of the land as determined by a third-party appraisal. See Note 2 subsection Revisions to Investment
in Land and the Unicoin Rights Financing Obligation for further details regarding the accounting of the California City investment
in land. 

On August 7, 2023, Unicoin entered into an
Asset Swap Agreement with Electroquimica del Neuquen S.A., an Argentine corporation (the Argentina Seller ), pursuant to
which the Argentina seller acquired rights to obtain Unicoin Rights from the Company in exchange for the disposition of certain
real estate assets described in the Asset Swap Agreement (the Argentina Real Estate Assets of the Argentina seller to the
Company (the Argentina Transaction ). 

On December 20, 2023, a deed of assignment
(the Deed of rights to explore for copper deposits in the Argentina Real Estate Assets was signed by the Argentina Seller
and the Company. According to Argentine law, the Deed is required to be filed with and approved by the State Government, Mining Registry
(Provice of Neuquen), for the transfer to be effective. Pursuant to the terms of the Deed, the Argentina Seller was required to register
the transfer of ownership of the Argentina Real Estate Assets to the Company with the local mining registry within 10 business days of
the execution of the Deed, and as of February 23, 2024, did not do so. On July 23, 2024, the Company formally registered with the
Province of Neuquen the transfer of the exploration rights to the Company. Therefore, the Company deems this transaction as executed on
July 23, 2024. Because of the contingencies regarding the registration and the fact that management had not become the owner of record
until July 23, 2024, management had not previously recorded this transaction on the Company s balance sheet. Upon the registration
on July 23, 2024, the Company recorded the mining exploration rights within the Investment in Land asset of and a corresponding Unicoin Rights Financing Obligation in
its consolidated balance sheet amounting to 7,100 thousand, which consisted of the fair value of

The Administrator determines the terms relating to the exercise, cancellation, or other disposition of options and stock awards upon a termination of employment, whether by reason of disability, retirement, death, or any other reason. 

The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of relating to stock option awards during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company measures the expense using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of a number of assumptions, including
expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected term. Expected volatility is based on the historic volatility
of a basket of certain publicly traded comparable companies. Management estimates the expected term of the award based on the contractual
as well as the exercise price of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve applicable to a period
equal to the expected term of the award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

- In February 2024, the Company acquired vacant farmland in Puerto Carre o Guacamayas, Colombia, having an appraised value of approximately
 1,300,000. Final transfer of title for such land is contingent upon tokenization and release of unicoins to the seller within twelve
months of the closing date, and therefore if such condition is not met, the transaction may be terminated. The agreement includes a project
failure clause in which if the unicoin is not tokenized, the agreement would be deemed as terminated. Upon the agreement termination,

The resulting effective tax rates were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s estimated effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets and the tax expense recorded for ITSQuest s separate federal income tax return because ITSQuest is not included in the Company s condensed consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and is not able to utilize Unicoin s deferred tax assets to offset taxable income. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. See Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements . 

Our Company 

Unicoin Inc. Unicoin , we ,
 us , our or the Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2015. In addition to a wholly
owned operating company running a Software-as-a-Service SaaS and Talent-as-a-Service TaaS platform, and
a majority-owned staffing agency, we are also the majority owners of Unicorns Inc., a media production company producing Unicorn Hunters ,
a business and investing reality show. 

In addition to the businesses we operate through our subsidiaries, we are developing a
security token called unicoin unicoin ), whose value is intended to be collateralized in part by certain of our current
and future assets, which assets will include certain equity positions acquired or to be acquired from Unicorn Hunters show participants.
The unicoins will also be supported in part by certain ownership rights in various real estate positions either currently owned or to
be acquired by us in the future in connection with our 140 Program. We are currently determining the structure that will be utilized to provide the collateral to support the
unicoins. There can be no assurance, however, that such current or prospective collateral will equal or exceed the fair market value
of the unicoins or whether such collateral will be subject to liens of our other creditors. We intend that when equity and real estate
positions that support the value of the unicoins are liquidated, the resulting proceeds (less fees and expenses, including a 20 fee
to be maintained by us) will be distributed to holders of the unicoins. The terms and timing of such distributions will be determined
by our board of directors and subject to our collateralization agreements with the collateral agent we engage. 

The organization chart below shows the operating subsidiaries and the interests held in them by the Company: 

34 

The Company has accepted digital assets including
Bitcoin BTC ), Ethereum ETH ), Wrapped Ethereum WETH and Tether USDT as consideration
from certain investors in exchange for equity or debt issued by the Company. The Company has ownership of and control over its digital
assets and uses the third-party custodial services of Coinbase Global, Inc Coinbase ), which is a publicly-traded company
that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform and provides custodial wallets to hold the digital assets. Coinbase provides us protection
through dual authentication security, which controls account access through requiring separate authentication from two authorized individuals.
Management monitors transactions and account balances through the Coinbase client portal, as applicable. 

On August 28, 2024, the Company notified its existing
investors that it is postponing its initial coin offering ICO of unicoins to conduct a thorough review of its public statements,
offering materials and its business in general. The Company has been conducting a thorough review of its compliance with applicable regulatory
requirements with the assistance of a leading national law firm. The Company cannot assess at this time the exact length of the review
and will work with outside legal counsel and the appropriate regulators as expeditiously as possible toward a path to continue its efforts
and plans for the launch of unicoins. 

As of September 30, 2024 and through the
filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has not issued any unicoins and there is no assurance as to whether,
or at what amount, or on what terms, unicoins will be available to be issued, if ever. 

We may accept certain cryptocurrencies, such as
BTC, ETH, USDT and WETH, among others, as payment for the purchase of Unicoin Rights or unicoins when launched. The Company intends to
hold these cryptocurrencies without converting into fiat currencies, in a MetaMask wallet linked to its INX account. Upon future liquidity
needs, through INX, the Company could pay a vendor for goods or services or convert the digital assets to a fiat currency, using the proceeds
for general business operational purposes. 

35 

Key Factors and Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Business 

Sources of Revenue 

The Company primarily derives its revenues from three revenue streams: 

1. 
 Subscription Revenue (SaaS) which is comprised of subscription license fees from customers accessing the Company s all-in-one cloud-based solution to manage remote workers software platform ). 

2. 
 Staffing Revenue (TaaS) whereby enterprise customers are connected to individuals who are able to assist them in projects. 

3. 
 Unicorns Revenue which generally represents the fair value of private company stock options or warrants, committed to be granted to the Company, as consideration for the right to present and promote those private companies on the Unicorn Hunters show. 

SaaS Revenue. For SaaS contracts, the typical subscription term is one year or less and the Company generally invoices its customers at the start of the subscription period when access to the software platform is provided. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and revenue is recognized over the subscription period. The legacy operations of the SaaS business are currently being phased out of operations through customer attrition and are no longer the focus of the Company s efforts. 

TaaS Revenue. For TaaS contracts, the Company s staffing contracts are typically for a duration of less than a year and are either on a fixed hourly rate basis or on a fixed cost basis billed upon satisfaction of respective milestones. The Company typically invoices its customers at the end of each month in cases where the contracts involve billing based on fixed hourly rates and/or once a milestone is reached. An over-time method is used to measure progress because the Company s obligation is to provide continuous service over the contractual period when fixed hourly rate billing is involved. For time-and-materials contracts, revenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice, when the services are rendered by the Company s remote workers in such cases. For milestone-based contracts, revenue is recognized over time using an output method based upon milestones achieved. Revenue is recognized once a milestone is reached for an amount of the transaction price that is proportionate to the total milestones in the contract. Milestones reached represent work performed and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. 

Unicorns Revenue . For Unicorns contracts,
customers are billed when an episode is distributed for broadcast or streaming. The promise to the customer is fulfilled and revenue
is recognized for the entire transaction price when an episode is distributed online or via social media. 

Gross Profit 

We define gross profit as the difference between total revenue and cost of revenue. 

For the SaaS and TaaS segments, cost of revenue includes salaries, and personnel compensation costs, associated with the Company s website hosting and other costs including providing technical support, materials, and supplies. For Unicorns, cost of revenue includes salaries and personnel compensation costs as noted for SaaS and TaaS but also includes third party costs for production team, celebrity hosts and travel. The Company evaluates if Unicorn Hunters show production costs are expected to be recovered. Costs are capitalized if expected to be recovered and otherwise are expensed as incurred. Any capitalized costs are expensed when the related show is distributed on the Unicorn Hunters website. 

36 

Operating Expenses 

Research and development costs are related to maintaining and improving the Company s software platform and primarily consist of personnel-related costs, including salaries and bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Research and development costs related to internal use software are not material and are expensed as they are incurred. 

Sales and marketing costs principally consist of third-party marketing, advertising, and branding in addition to compensation and benefits of the Company s own marketing personnel. Sales, marketing and advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 

General and administrative costs primarily consist of compensation, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation related to executive management, finance, administration and human resources, facility costs, professional service fees, and other general overhead costs. 

Global Pandemic Conditions 

The coronavirus pandemic has given rise to increased remote work for millions of companies around the world. In light of the major shift to home office models without protocols, our platform was designed to increase remote workers productivity, protect client budgets from overbilling, allow coordination and monitoring of their remote workforce and provide real-time information on the cost and status of all tasks and projects. However, going forward, we expect our remote workforce management business to produce lower returns than those we deem achievable through Unicorn Hunters and Unicoin. Accordingly, we plan to wind down our SaaS and TaaS services as our primary business segments beginning in 2024. Phasing out by attrition cannot be planned with precision, as it depends on the client s decision to discontinue use of our services. 

As we don t make efforts to replace the departing clients, such attrition will eventually phase out our remote workforce management operations, with the exception of ITSQuest. No plans have been made to dispose of ITSQuest, as such decision depends on its respective financial performance. If profitable, it may remain a profit-generating unit in our portfolio of assets indefinitely, assuming the Company achieves either of the two trigger events necessary to avoid the forced divestiture of ITSQuest by December 31, 2024. In the event that ITSQuest diverts back to its sellers on December 31, 2024, it would no longer be a profit-generating unit in our portfolio and the impact is expected to be material. Refer to additional disclosure in the Going Concern disclosure on Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We intend to focus our efforts to make Unicorn Hunters the most widely watched business show in the business media markets and worldwide entertainment, while generating value for the Company s shareholders through equity acquisitions and syndication, sales of preferred-access memberships, advertisement and merchandising revenues. 

Economic and Labor Trends 

Demand for our talent pool, consultants, and growth of placement services are dependent upon general economic and labor trends. We believe that the Company is well positioned in the current macroeconomic environment, particularly as economies continue to reopen and demand for services increase. We expect greater geographical work flexibility and the legacy of the coronavirus pandemic to continue and help drive business growth. 

Demand for Diversity and Demographic Changes 

Diversity and talent form the bedrock of our company. We believe that female engagement in the workplace will increase and become a major feature of the corporate environment going forward as female workforce participation and higher education opportunities increase. 

37 

Dynamic and Evolving Technology 

The ability to respond in time to technology trends and new developments is a key determinant of our business and operational performance. We believe this will widen our platform s appeal to new customers, while expanding our potential opportunities for investment, resulting in greater revenue growth. 

Majority-Owned Subsidiaries 

ITSQuest 

The Company is the majority owner of ITSQuest.
The Company s ownership interest is 51 . We acquired ITSQuest as an information technology staffing company, providing
staffing services and solutions. ITSQuest, has an outstanding tax liability of 5.0 million. As part of the acquisition agreement,
the sellers and owners of the non-controlling interest of 49 agreed to indemnify the Company for such outstanding tax liability.
The Company holds in reserve 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock owned by the sellers of ITSQuest, until the tax
liability has been settled. Our ownership interest In ITSQuest includes a contingent divestiture clause that, in the event that the
Company did not conduct a registered public offering of its Common Stock in which the Company s shares issued to the sellers
of ITSQuest are registered with the SEC and listed for trading on a national securities exchange in the United States, with an
initial listing price of at least 10 per share (the trigger event ), on or before December 31, 2024, the Company
shall transfer to ITSQuest all of the Company s rights, title and interest in ITSQuest, including ITSQuest equity as well as
any of the Company s shares that remain subject to a holdback provision regarding tax liabilities, thus completely divesting
itself of all ownership in ITSQuest. In addition, there is an alternative trigger event, that if achieved on or before
December 31, 2024, the Company would not be required to divest its interest in ITSQuest back to the sellers if the
Company s proposed security tokens unicoins are tokenized and listed on an available Alternative Trading System
or cryptocurrency exchange (whichever is applicable), with a quoted price at or above 1.00 per token. As of the filing date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has assessed that it is unlikely it will achieve either of the two trigger events
necessary to avoid divestiture of ITSQuest. If the Company is not able to achieve an initial offering of its Common Stock or an
initial registration of its unicoins, sufficient to meet the criteria outlined in the Amended SEA, or is unable to negotiate an
extension with ITSQuest, on or before December 31, 2024, 

On August 28, 2024, the Company notified its existing
investors that it is postponing its ICO of unicoins to conduct a thorough review of its public statements, offering materials and its
business in general. The Company has been conducting a thorough review of its compliance with applicable regulatory requirements with
the assistance of a leading national law firm. The Company cannot assess at this time the exact length of the review and will work with
outside legal counsel and the appropriate regulators as expeditiously as possible toward a path to continue its efforts and plans for
the launch of unicoins. As of September 30, 2024 and through the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has
not developed or issued any unicoins and there is no assurance as to whether, or at what amount, or on what terms, unicoins will be available
to be issued, if ever. 

As a result of the extended deadline provided
in the Share Exchange Agreement, as amended on December 28, 2022 (the Amended SEA ), the Company has assessed that it is unlikely it will achieve either of the two trigger events necessary to avoid divestiture of ITSQuest. If the Company is not
able to achieve an initial offering of its Common Stock or an initial registration of its unicoins, sufficient to meet the criteria outlined
in the Amended SEA, or is unable to negotiate an extension with ITSQuest, on or before December 31, 2024, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity
will be materially impacted as ITSQuest represented Company assets of 10,255 thousand or 28 of total assets, revenues of 13,610 thousand or 88 of total revenues,
and generated gross profit of 2,739 thousand or 90 of total gross profit as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Unicorns 

The Company is the majority owner of Unicorns. On February 21, 2024, the Company s majority owned subsidiary, Unicorns, issued 5,000,000 common stock shares to an Executive Producer for the Unicorn Hunters show. This issuance was compensation in connection with the completion of Season 1 of the Unicorn Hunters show. This transaction decreased the Company s ownership interest from 66.67 to 62.50 . On March 11, 2024, Moe Vela sold his entire ownership in Unicorns of 7,500,000 common stock shares to the Company, in exchange for 1,500,000 Unicoin Rights. This transaction increased the Company s ownership interest from 62.50 to 71.88 . Accordingly, the Company s ownership interest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 71.88 and 66.67 , respectively. 

38 

Unicorns produces a reality television/streaming
show called Unicorn Hunters that showcases private companies seeking to obtain publicity for their private offerings by appearing on
the show and attempting to raise capital by advertising their exempt offerings to a wide audience. The revenue consideration from
Unicorns customers is fixed at contract inception and has historically been received in one of two forms: 1) either a pre-determined
number of stock options, warrants or shares or 2) options or warrants or shares representing a specific percentage of the
customer s common stock outstanding as of a particular point in time. Non-cash consideration is recognized at the estimated
fair value at or near the date of contract inception. As of the date hereof, we have collected all securities as payment for
Unicorns services. 

Other Events 

On August 9, 2024, the Company detected an unknown
threat actor had gained access to the Company s Google G-Suite account and therefore the Company s G-Suite products (i.e.,
G-Mail, G-Drive and other related G-Suite functionality). The Company previously disclosed that the unknown actor changed passwords and
access to all users having an @unicoin.com email address (the Event ). Upon further investigation, it was determined
that the unknown actor did not in fact change passwords, but rather the Company s IT team disabled all passwords when the unauthorized
access was discovered and implemented stricter verification and access protocols for its users. On or about August 13, 2024, the Company
was able to remove the threat actor s access to the G-Suite accounts and restore access to its internal users. The Company examined
the information accessed to determine and mitigate the impact of the Event and determined that no data or funds were accessed or taken
from our systems, and therefore the Event was immaterial. The Company determined the following details in connection with the Event: 

1. 
 Unauthorized access to corporate G-Suite services was gained by unknown persons. 

2. 
 During a personal check of corporate users of internal services, discrepancies were found in the personal data of employees and/or contractors in the Company s accounting department. 

3. 
 Traces of hacked messages and email accounts of certain managers of the Company were found. 

4. 
 Traces of identity forgery of one of the contractors of the Company were found and such contractor subsequently was terminated. 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
the Event has not had a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. To the knowledge of the Company s
management, no traces of loss of any of the Company s cash or crypto assets have been found as a result of the Event.

Total revenues increased by 1,096 thousand, or

TaaS . TAAS revenues increased by 1,082
thousand, or 8 , to 15,486 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 14,404 thousand for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in ITSQuest related revenues of 1,318 thousand, partially offset by a decrease
in SheWorks! related revenue of 236 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in ITSQuest was mainly driven
by government customers. 

SaaS . SaaS revenues increased by 14 thousand,
or 139 to 24 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 9 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
legacy operations of the SaaS business (engaged in providing workforce management software to better monitor and manage a remote workforce)
are currently being phased out of operations through customer attrition, and are no longer the focus of the Company s efforts. 

Unicorns . Unicorns revenues for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3 thousand. Unicorns recognizes revenues when an episode of Unicorn Hunters is distributed
for broadcast or streaming. The Company did not record any significant revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
as there were no episodes distributed during that period.

2023. 

TaaS. TAAS cost of revenues increased by
 900 thousand, or 8 , to 12,338 thousand. The increase was proportional to the increase in TAAS revenues. 

Unicorns . Unicorns cost of revenues increased
by 93 thousand to 123 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 30 thousand, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase in Cost of Revenues was mainly due to the stock-based compensation expense of 100 thousand in
relation to the earning of five million Unicorns Common Stock Awards by executive producers of Unicorn Hunters. No episodes were produced
during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

General and administrative 

General and administrative expenses increased
by 7,656 thousand, or 70 , to 18,543 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 10,887 thousand for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in transaction loss on reacquisition of Unicoin Rights of 6,551
thousand, as explained on Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Sales and marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 10,531
thousand, or 371 , to 13,373 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in
sales marketing expenses paid with Unicoin Rights as consideration, which amounted to 8,671 thousand. These service providers agreed to provide their advertising media services in exchange for payment in
the form of Unicoin Rights. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not engage in these type of advertising
media services as providers were not as willing to accept Unicoin Rights as consideration. 

Research and development 

Research and development expense decreased by
 221 thousand, or 95 , to 12 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Internally developed software costs for internal
use and other research and development costs are not material and are expensed as they are incurred. 

Interest income (expense), net 

Net interest expense decreased by 29 thousand,
or 19 to 126 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 154 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The change was primarily due to the net reduction in outstanding Unsecured Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Repayments
of short-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 192 thousand and 593 thousand, respectively.

(0.8 and (1.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s estimated effective tax rate differs
from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax
assets and the tax expense recorded for ITSQuest s separate federal income tax return because ITSQuest is not included in the Company s
condensed consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and is not able to utilize Unicoin s deferred tax assets to offset taxable
income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits. 

Net income (losses) attributable to the non-controlling
interest 

Net income attributable to the non-controlling
interest decreased by (319) thousand, or (95) , to a net loss of (15) thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our non-controlling

2023, respectively. Our non-controlling interest holders in Unicorns were allocated a loss of (256) thousand and income of 119 thousand
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, non-controlling interest in ITSQuest and
Unicorns represented an ownership interest of 49 and 28.12 , respectively. As of September 30, 2023, non-controlling interest in ITSQuest

General and administrative expenses increased

Net income (losses) attributable to the non-controlling
interest 

Net income attributable to the non-controlling
interest increased by (1,619) thousand, or (36) , to a net loss of (6,074) thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
Our non-controlling interest holders in were allocated income of 88 thousand and 56 thousand for the three months ended September

in ITSQuest and Unicorns represented an ownership interest of 49 and 28.12 , respectively. As of September 30, 2023, non-controlling
interest in ITSQuest and Unicorns represented an ownership interest of 49 and 33.3 , respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary future uses of cash will be to fund
working capital requirements and expenditures of Unicorns. 

We had cash and cash
equivalents of 4,205 thousand available as of September 30, 2024. Based on currently available capital resources (cash and cash
equivalents on hand as of September 30, 2024), we estimate that at our current cash burn rate , we would be able to
conduct our planned operations for approximately six additional months without raising additional equity or debt financing, assuming
we do not fail to develop and launch the unicoin during that period or we do not fail to negotiate an extension to avoid a
divestiture from ITSQuest. If we do fail to launch unicoins during that period, the Company will need to obtain additional financing
to continue its operations. and if we do not launch unicoins at any point in the future, we believe the Company would be required to
pay the significant financing obligation that it has incurred with respect to the unicoin rights, which would also require
additional financing. For the company to maintain operations for at least twelve months, we would need to receive further equity or
debt financing of approximately 4,206 thousand. However, given the impact of the economic downturn on the U.S. and global financial
markets, the Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed. In addition, the Company has recorded a
significant financing obligation that we believe the Company would be required to pay in the event the unicoin is not launched and
there remains significant uncertainty as to if, and when, this launch may occur. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. Our auditors have included an explanatory
paragraph in their audit opinion, included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that our
current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months
unless we obtain additional capital. The Company anticipates that such conditions will continue to exist until either significant
financing has been obtained and/or the uncertainty surrounding the development and launch of the unicoin has been resolved. 

45 

From January 1, 2024 through September 30,
2024, the Company issued 900 million Unicoin Rights (units) to receive unicoins, to investors and service providers in exchange of consideration
consisting of cash 4,709 thousand and operating expenses paid with Unicoin Rights amounting to approximately 12,634 thousand. 

During 2020, ITSQuest entered an account receivable
financing arrangement with a financial institution Factor ). Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement, the Company sells
amounts of its accounts receivable balances to the Factor as absolute owner with full recourse against ITSQuest. In accordance with ASC
860, Transfers and Servicing ASC 860 ), we concluded that the transaction with the Factor represents a transfer of
financial assets in which the Company retains effective control over the transferred receivables. As such it was determined that the transfer
of financial asset should be recorded as a secured borrowing. Furthermore, the Company shall continue to report the transferred financial
asset in its statement of financial position with no change in the asset s measurement. Accordingly, the Company records the receivable
as is on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and records a liability for the amount received from the Factor towards factored receivables
in a manner similar to secured borrowing with pledge of a collateral. The Factor remits 95 of the account receivable balance to the Company
and retains 5 factoring fee for the invoices factored. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of 82 thousand towards
the Factor. The cost of factoring is included as a component of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations. 

As part of the agreement in which the Company
received 50,000,001 shares of Unicorns stock, the Company extended an initial line of credit to Unicorns in the amount of 10,000 thousand
to fund production of the Unicorn Hunters show and related expenses. Further additional ongoing funding has been provided by the Company
to Unicorns, since the initial line of credit, to fund the production- related expenses of Unicorn Hunters show. This intercompany loan,
which is eliminated in consolidation, amounted to 26,878 thousand as of September 30, 2024. Beyond the initial 10,000 thousand line
of credit, the Company does not have any contractual commitments to fund the operations of Unicorns. However, it is the Company s
intention to continue funding the operations of Unicorns, until Unicorns begins generating sufficient cash flows to sustain its own business
operations without using additional funding from the Company.

Our reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The majority of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, although we also have sales internationally. Therefore, our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk, but that may change in the future. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments, although we may choose to do so in the future. We do not believe a 10 increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar would have a material impact on our operating results. 

Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company s cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts with major financial institutions, and, at times, exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts are monitored by management to mitigate risk. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions holding our cash and cash equivalents. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based on an evaluation under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company s management, and due to the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting
described below, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective for the
period ended September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls 

The Company s internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of condensed
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(i) 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 

(ii) 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
 permit preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company s receipts and
 expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and 

(iii) 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

48 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection
with management s evaluation during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Remediation Initiatives 

In an effort to address the identified material weakness and enhance our internal controls related to our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, The Company has continued to address the material weaknesses reported our Annual Report on Form 10-K through the following actions: 

- 
 Engaging third-party consultants with appropriate expertise to assist the finance and accounting department on an interim basis until key roles are filled; 

- 
 Assessing finance and accounting resources to identify the areas and functions that lack sufficient personnel and recruiting for experienced personnel to assume these roles; 

- 
 Developing further training on segregation of duties; and 

- 
 Designing and implementing additional compensating controls where necessary. 

While we are working diligently to remediate these material weaknesses, there is no assurance that these material weaknesses will be fully remediated by December 31, 2024.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

We may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature we believe are normal and incidental to our business. These matters may include product liability, intellectual property, employment, personal injury caused by our employees, and other general claims. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

In addition to the information set forth in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 (the Risk
Factors ). These Risk Factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results. These Risk Factors
are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant
also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results in the future.

The price per Unicoin Right was determined by a tiered pricing schedule based on volume. Each transaction on each of these issuances had at least a certain number of Unicoin Rights issued at the specified price. 

Unicoin Rights issued as a non-cash distribution to shareholders and as discretionary compensation to employees are not included in this table. Refer to Note 7 Unicoin Rights Financing Obligation of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , for details regarding the issuance of those Unicoin Rights. 

The date represents when the Unicoin Right transaction was funded by the investor. The price was agreed at a previous date when the investor subscribed to such price with a commitment to purchase soon after. In the future, there might be additional transactions funded at each of these prices listed.
