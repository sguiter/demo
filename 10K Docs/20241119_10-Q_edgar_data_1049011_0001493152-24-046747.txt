 million shares of its preferred shares of the Company,
representing of our total issued and outstanding voting shares of common stock and preferred stock. Simultaneously with the purchase,
the officers and directors of the Company resigned. Frank I Igwealor, Chairman and CEO, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director; Patience
C Ogbozor, Director; and Dr. Solomon SK Mbagwu, MD, Director, were elected to replace them. Following the share sales to Cannabinoid
Biosciences, Inc., the purchaser converted of the preferred shares for shares of the Company s current outstanding
shares of common stock. 

Following
the consummation of the October 21, 2019 transactions, the Company decided to restart filing important information immediately. The Company
used the Form 10-12(g) to register its common stock with the SEC. 

On
September 15, 2020, Kid Castle Educational Corporation (the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with certain
corporation related to our President and CEO with respect to the private placement of shares of its preferred stock at a purchase
price of in cash and a transfer of interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (a California Limited
Liability Company). The shares were issued to the investors without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 based upon exemptions
from registration provided under Section 4(2) of the Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The issuance did not involve any public
offering; no general solicitation or general advertising was used in connection with the offering. Community Economic Development Capital,
is a specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, medical
real estate investments, related commercial facilities, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related services. 

Similarly,
on September 16, 2020, as part of its purchase of unregistered securities from certain corporation related to our President and CEO,
the Company, received in cash and shares of its preferred stock, and in exchange transferred interest in, and control
of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC CED Capital ), a California Limited Liability Company, and of the issued
and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), to GiveMePower Corporation, a Nevada corporation. This
transaction gave the Company of the voting control of GiveMePower. 

On
April 21, 2021, the Company sold Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation, to Premier Information
Management, Inc. for in cash. As further consideration pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned Kid Castle Educational Inc., the
parent Company of GMPW, the shares of KDCE preferred stock and shares of KDCE common stock that CBDX bought in October
of 2019. Pursuant to the April 21, 2021 transaction, CBDX ceased from being a subsidiary of GMPW, effective April 1, 2021. 

On
December 30, 2021, in exchange for its control block in GiveMePower Corporation, the Company received stake in Alpharidge Capital
LLC from GiveMePower, in a cashless transaction, resulting in each public company going its separate way as an independent company. 

On
January 12, 2024, due to the company s need to simplify its balance sheet in order to approach the regulators to remove the Caveat
Emptor tag from the company s OTC Market profile, the company sold Alpharidge Capital LLC, its main operating subsidiary to American
Community Capital, LP., a California limited partnership controlled by our President and CEO Mr. Frank I Igwealor, in exchange for cash
payment of payable in two hundred and forty equal monthly payments of , beginning on July 1, 2024. As at the time
of confirmation of the transaction, the combined average market capitalization of NIHK and KDCE was for NIHK, and
 for KDCE), showing the FAIR MARKET value of the two parents of Alpharidge to have a combined market value of . 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore does not include the operating results of Alpharidge Capital LLC. Alpharidge ),
which has been the main operating subsidiary of the company in previous reporting periods. The company will continue to make acquisitions
and intends to consolidate others subsidiaries in which Kid Castle has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under
the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), after
elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

ASC
810 requires that the investor with the controlling financial interest should consolidate the investee/affiliate. ASC 810-10 requires
that an equity interest investor consolidates a VIE when it retains an investment in the entity, is considered a variable interest investor
in the entity, and is the primary beneficiary of the entity. An investor in a VIE is a variable interest beneficiary when,
per an arrangement s governing documents, the investor will absorb a portion of the VIE s expected losses or will receive
a portion of the entity s residual returns. The variable interest beneficiary retaining a controlling financial interest
in the VIE is designated as its primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. A variable interest beneficiary retains
a controlling financial interest in a VIE when that beneficiary retains the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
have the greatest influence over the VIE s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE s significant
losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

from operations and gross income from the sale of an operating subsidiary,
and an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet our ongoing
operating expenses and ultimately in merging with another entity with experienced management and profitable operations. No assurances
can be given that we will be successful in achieving these objectives. 

to ownership)
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Operating results of acquired businesses are included in the Consolidated Statements
of Income from the date of acquisition. We consolidate variable interest entities if we have operational and financial control, and are
deemed to be the > beneficiary of the profit and loss of the entity. Operating results for variable interest entities in which
we are determined to be the primary beneficiary are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date such determination
is made. For convenience and ease of reference, we refer to the financial statement caption Income before Income Taxes and Equity
Income as pre-tax income throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

and balance of cash equivalents respectively. 

The
Company values its securities that are freely tradable and are listed on a national securities exchange or reported on the NASDAQ national
market at their last sales price as of the last business day of the year. Changes in fair value is reflected in the Company s statement
of operations. 

Many
cash and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts have bid-and-ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest
price that the marketplace participants are willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that the marketplace participants
are willing to accept for an asset. For securities whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices, the Company s policy for securities
traded in the OTC markets and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are valued at their last reported bid 
price if held long, and last reported asked price if sold short. The Company considers these investments level 1 securities
for active markets and level 2 securities for thinly traded markets. 

Our
financial instruments consist of accounts payable and accruals and our accruals- related parties. The carrying amount of the out accounts
payable and accruals, accruals- related parties and loans related parties approximates their fair values because of the short-term
maturities of these instruments. 

At
 fair value, if the investment in equity securities has a readily determinable fair value. 

At
 adjusted cost, if the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value. Adjusted cost represents the historical cost, less
 impairment if any. If the Company identifies observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment
 of the same issuer, the Company measures the equity security at fair value as of the date that the observable transaction occurred
 in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 321, Investments in Equity Securities. 

A
judgmental aspect of accounting for investments is evaluating whether a decline in the value of an investment has occurred. The evaluation
of impairment is dependent on specific quantitative and qualitative factors and circumstances surrounding an investment, including recurring
operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financing. Most of the Company s equity investments do not have readily
determinable market values. All investments are reviewed for changes in circumstances or occurrence of events that suggest the Company s
investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss, if any, is recognized in the period the determination is made. 

Significant
Transaction 

Significant
Transaction, also known as common control transactions occur frequently, particularly in the context of reorganizations, spinoffs, and
initial public offerings. Common control transactions are generally accounted for by the receiving entity based on the nature of the
transactions. For example, transactions involving the transfer of an asset (such as an unoccupied building) are accounted for by the
receiving entity at the carrying value of the asset transferred on a prospective basis. Conversely, transactions involving the transfer
of a business ordinarily will result in a change in reporting entity for the receiving entity and require retrospective combination of
the entities for all periods presented using the historical cost basis of the parent. 

ASC
850 covers transactions and relationships with related parties. It applies to all reporting entities, including the separate financial
statements of a subsidiary, as discussed in ASC 850-10-15-2. Identifying related party relationships and transactions requires a reporting
entity to first determine whether a party meets the definition of a related party. 

ASC
850-10-20 described r elated parties to include: 

a. 
 Affiliates
 of the entity 

b. 
 Entities
 for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value
 Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity 

c. 
 Trusts
 for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management 

d. 
 Principal
 owners of the entity and members of their immediate families 

e. 
 Management
 of the entity and members of their immediate families 

f. 
 Other
 parties with which the entity may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies
 of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests 

g. 
 Other
 parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership
 interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting
 parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests 

The
following definitions applies under ASC 850-10-20 

Affiliate:
 A party that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
an entity. 

Control:
 The possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity through
ownership, by contract, or otherwise. 

Immediate
family: Family members who might control or influence a principal owner or a member of management, or who might be controlled or
influenced by a principal owner or a member of management, because of the family relationship. 

Management:
 Persons who are responsible for achieving the objectives of the entity and who have the authority to establish policies and make
decisions by which those objectives are to be pursued. Management normally includes members of the board of directors, the chief executive
officer, chief operating officer, vice presidents in charge of principal business functions (such as sales, administration, or finance),
and other persons who perform similar policy making functions. Persons without formal titles also may be members of management. 

Principal
owners: Owners of record or known beneficial owners of more than of the voting interests of the entity. 

FASB
Statement No. 141 (EITF 02-5), in conjunction with SEC staff s conclusions in EITF 02-5 stated that common control exists between
(or among) separate entities in the following situations: 

An
 individual or enterprise holds more than of the voting ownership interest of each entity. 

A
 group of shareholders holds more than of the voting ownership interest of each entity, and contemporaneous written evidence of
 an agreement to vote a majority of the entities shares in concert exists. 

Immediate
 family members (married couples and their children, but not their grandchildren) hold more than of the voting ownership interest
 of each entity (with no evidence that those family members will vote their shares in any way other than in concert). Entities may
 be owned in varying combinations among living siblings and their children. Those situations require careful consideration regarding
 the substance of the ownership and voting relationships. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded significant transactions including loans from our officers, directors, and
entities under the control or influence of our officers and directors. 

On
January 12, 2024, due to the company s need to simplify its balance sheet in order to approach the regulators to remove the Caveat
Emptor tag from the company s OTC Market profile, the company sold Alpharidge Capital LLC, its main operating subsidiary to American
Community Capital, LP., a California limited partnership controlled by our President and CEO Mr. Frank I Igwealor, in exchange for cash
payment of payable in two hundred and forty equal monthly payments of , beginning on July 1, 2024. As at the time
of confirmation of the transaction, the combined average market capitalization of NIHK and KDCE was for NIHK, and
 for KDCE), showing the FAIR MARKET value of the two parents of Alpharidge to have a combined market value of . 

owned and controlled by Video River Networks, Inc. Because of the consolidated subsidiary relationship
between these two public companies, the singular Revenue, Assets and Liabilities recognized and disclosed on the financial statements
of Kid Castle Educational Corporation are also recognized and disclosed on the financial statements of Video River Networks, Inc. pursuant
to ASC 810. 

The
accounting update also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognize interest expense on the lease liability, separately from
the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized
as a combined expense. In addition, this accounting update requires expanded disclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements. 

The
Company does not have operating and financing leases as of September 30, 2024. The adoption of ASC 842 did not materially impact our
results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. The Company has reviewed the new standard and does not expect it to have
a material impact to the statement of financial condition or its net capital.

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not record any revenue from principal transaction. 

Contract
balances 

Substantially
all receivables from contracts with customers within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue From Contracts
With Customers (ASC 606), are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Unsatisfied
performance obligations 

We
do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606.
The practical expedient applies to and is elected for contracts where we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to
invoice for services performed. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
(other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606). 

Revenue
Recognition Entrepreneurship Development 

Under
ASC 606, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. FASB ASC 606-10-05-3 through 05-4 and 606-10-10-2
through 10-4. To achieve the core principle of ASC 606, an entity should take the following actions: Step 1: Identify the contract with
a customer; Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract; Step 3: Determine the transaction price; Step 4: Allocate the
transaction price; and Step 5: Recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

Revenue
is recognized when a company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when
the customer obtains control of that good or service). An entity should consider the terms of the contract and all relevant facts and
circumstances when applying the revenue recognition standard. An entity should apply the revenue recognition standard, including the
use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our Entrepreneurship Development Revenue was derived from the sale of asset (control in pubco) to the buyer who
assumes control of the pubco at the close of the sales transaction. A sale transaction could involve cash-only, cash and note, or note-only.
For the contract that includes financing or convertible note, the seller evaluated the collectibility of the transaction price, and the
probability that the seller will collect the consideration. Seller addressed the risk of collectability by using a convertible note with
very favorable conversion. 

Determining
whether a sale is to a customer: Per ASC 610-20-15-4(a), if the counterparty in the transaction is a customer and the assets being
transferred are an output of the reporting entity s ordinary activities, the transaction is within the scope of ASC 606. As stated
in ASC 606, a customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the reporting
entity s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration (e.g., a car manufacturer sells a car that it produced to a customer,
a homebuilder sells a home that it developed to a customer). 

Step
1: A sales contract/agreement (SPA) is used to consummate the sale. Buyer and seller signed the SPA and other collateral documents
including the Notes and other documents designed to ensure collectability if the sale is cash-and-note or note-only. Where the sale was
not an all-cash transaction, seller evaluated the collectibility of the transaction price, or the probability that the seller will collect
the consideration. 

Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. All performance obligations under the SPA must be completed prior to the
close of the transaction. Our Entrepreneurship Development revenue was only recognized after all performance obligations has been performed
or completed. 

Step
3: Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for each sale recognized as EDI revenue was listed on the face of the contract. 

Step
4: Allocate the transaction price . The transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each specific
good or service promised to the customer. Since EDI revenue did not involve bundled services, rather EDI assets are accounted for as
a standalone transaction, the total sale price is recognized immediately. 

Step
5: Recognize revenue. Revenue is recognized as the seller satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised
good or service to the customer. As at September 30, 2024, we recorded 0 in EDI sales completed in during the period because we had
no transaction that satisfied the performance obligation by transferring control of the pubco to the customer and made adequate provision
for the collectability of the convertible notes.

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements ,
which amends FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements . This ASU eliminates, modifies and adds various disclosure requirements
for fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Certain disclosures are required to be applied using a retrospective approach and others using a prospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted. The various disclosure requirements being eliminated, modified or added are not significant to us. As a
result, we currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
That is a Service Contract , which amends FASB ASC Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software . This
ASU adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements.
The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract
with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements
that include an internal-use software license). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either using a retrospective or prospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) 
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . Currently, there is no guidance
in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to
continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide such guidance. In doing
so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management
to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently
in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation
every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans,
(5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a
period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update
are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We currently
do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities. This ASU clarifies that the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements,
and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in
FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The amendments in this ASU are
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on net income. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In
February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations
Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. 
This ASU addresses the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several arrangements
including debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, and settled litigation and judicial rulings. The ASU is effective for public
entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative
Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in
a Foreign Entity . This ASU addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a
part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets
that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The guidance outlines the events when cumulative translation adjustments
should be released into net income and is intended by FASB to eliminate some disparity in current accounting practice. This ASU is effective
prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Liquidation Basis of Accounting. 
The amendments require an entity to prepare its financial statements using the liquidation basis of accounting when liquidation is imminent.
Liquidation is imminent when the likelihood is remote that the entity will return from liquidation and either (a) a plan for liquidation
is approved by the person or persons with the authority to make such a plan effective and the likelihood is remote that the execution
of the plan will be blocked by other parties or (b) a plan for liquidation is being imposed by other forces (for example, involuntary
bankruptcy). If a plan for liquidation was specified in the entity s governing documents from the entity s inception (for
example, limited-life entities), the entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting only if the approved plan for liquidation
differs from the plan for liquidation that was specified at the entity s inception. The amendments require financial statements
prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting to present relevant information about an entity s expected resources in liquidation
by measuring and presenting assets at the amount of the expected cash proceeds from liquidation. The entity should include in its presentation
of assets any items it had not previously recognized under U.S. GAAP but that it expects to either sell in liquidation or use in settling
liabilities (for example, trademarks). The amendments are effective for entities that determine liquidation is imminent during annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods therein. We currently do not anticipate this standard
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

We
have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements. Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. As new accounting
pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances. 

Trading

to their current market value. These securities will be recorded in the current assets section under the Investment Securities account
and will be offset in the shareholder s equity section under the unrealized proceeds from sale of short-term investments 
account. The Short Term Investments account amount represents the current market value of the securities, and the Unrealized Proceeds

price of in cash and a transfer of interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (a California Limited
Liability Company). The shares were issued to the investors without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 based upon exemptions
from registration provided under Section 4(2) of the Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The issuances did not involve any public
offering; no general solicitation or general advertising was used in connection with the offering. Community Economic Development Capital,
is a specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, medical
real estate investments, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related services. 

Similarly,
on September 16, 2020, as part of its purchase of unregistered securities from certain corporation related to our President and CEO,
the Company, received in cash and shares of its preferred stock, and in exchange transferred interest in, and control
of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC CED Capital ), a California Limited Liability Company, and of the issued
and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), to GiveMePower Corporation, a Nevada corporation. This
transaction gave the Company of the voting control of GiveMePower. As at the time of this transaction, all four businesses involved
in the transaction were controlled by Mr. Frank I Igwealor. Because both the buyer and seller in the
above acquisitions were under the control of the same person, the transaction was classified as common control transaction and
 therefore fall under Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control subsections
of ASC 805-50. This transaction was therefore accounted for under the Consolidation Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model
wherein we consolidate all investees operating results if we expect to assume more than 50 of another entity s expected losses
or gains. 

On
April 21, 2021, the Company sold Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation, to Premier Information
Management, Inc. for in cash. As further consideration pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned Kid Castle Educational Inc., the

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand
a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This Quarterly Report and other written and oral statements
that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans
and assumptions regarding future events or performance. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words
such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, will 
and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome
of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. 

We
caution that the factors described herein, and other factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to
differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue reliance on
any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made,
and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such
statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time
to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our
results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements. 

General 

The
following discussion highlights Kid Castle results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition
as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant
for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following
discussion and analysis are based on our audited Financial Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related
notes thereto. 

Kid
Castle Educational Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Kid Castle, the Company, We, KDCE, 
 Us or Our operates and manages a portfolio of real estate properties, digital assets, and other in-demand
properties. Kid Castle engages in rollup and consolidation of real estate, Biopharma and digital economy assets and operations. 

The
Company changed its CBD-focused business after selling Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. in April 2021, to refocus on acquisition and management
of businesses and assets in real estate, Biopharma and digital economy. As the subsidiary of Video River Networks, Inc. (NIHK), the Company s
business plan is to help NIHK to achieve its business plan. The Company therefore will focus on rolling up Artificial Intelligence, Machine
Learning, Robotics, and digital assets and businesses in North America. 

Our
vision is to acquire and rollup profitable Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets across the United
States of America. There is no guarantee that we could successfully make any acquisition or rollup. Our mission as stated above is only
a guiding principle as we start our acquisition. We have never made any big acquisition prior to this moment. Although we have a theoretical
picture of what our mission called for, none of our staff have ever done it previously. 

Our
principal business objective is to maximize stockholder returns through a combination of (1) acquisition and rollup of profitable Artificial
Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets across the United States of America (2) sustainable long-term growth in
cash flows from increased profits, which we hope to pass on to stockholders in the form of distributions, and (3) potential long-term
appreciation in the value of our businesses through process optimization and financial engineering. However, because of COVID-19, we
were unable to obtain the financing necessary to make the acquisition of the businesses we needed to acquire. There is no guarantee that
we could be able to acquire one or more in the future. In addition, there is no guarantee that viable businesses would still be available
to us to acquire in the future, or at reasonable price. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
unaudited financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include a summary of our significant accounting
policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary
to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature. 

28 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

ASC
810 requires that the investor with the controlling financial interest should consolidate the investee/affiliate. ASC 810-10 requires
that an equity interest investor consolidates a VIE when it retains an investment in the entity, is considered a variable interest investor
in the entity, and is the primary beneficiary of the entity. An investor in a VIE is a variable interest beneficiary when,
per an arrangement s governing documents, the investor will absorb a portion of the VIE s expected losses or will receive
a portion of the entity s residual returns. The variable interest beneficiary retaining a controlling financial interest
in the VIE is designated as its primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. A variable interest beneficiary retains
a controlling financial interest in a VIE when that beneficiary retains the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
have the greatest influence over the VIE s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE s significant
losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include the three months operating results of the all wholly owned subsidiaries
and the balance sheet represent the financial position as at 3/31/2023 of the Company includes Alpharidge Capital LLC and Others subsidiaries
in which Kid Castle has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. 

Overview 

Corporate
History 

Kid
Castle was the result of a share exchange transaction, commonly referred to as a reverse merger, pursuant to which shareholders of an
offshore operating company take control of a U.S. company that has no operations (commonly referred to as a shell company), and the offshore
operating company becomes a subsidiary of the U.S. company. In KDCE case, the offshore company was Higoal Developments Ltd., which was
the parent company of Kid Castle Internet Technologies Limited and Kid Castle Education Software Development Co. Limited, KDCE s
operating companies that run our English language instruction business. The U.S. or shell company, at the time of the share exchange,
was King Ball International Technology Corporation. 

Kid
Castle used to be a Florida corporation until the company voluntarily dissolved its Florida registration with intention to simultaneously
incorporate in Delaware and convert into a Delaware corporation. Although the company immediately finalized its registration effort to
convert into a Delaware Corporation, the company s registered agent who was supposed to submit the registration package to the
Delaware Secretary of State for certification, failed to make a timely submission. Later in January 2019, when the company realized that
the Delaware incorporation/registration package/process was never submitted to the Delaware Secretary of State nor completed in any other
way or form, the Company went ahead and resubmitted the required registration package and was then formally re-incorporated in Delaware
and convert into a Delaware corporation. Thus, the company was formally incorporated in Delaware and converted into a Delaware Corporation
in January 2019. 

The
re-incorporation in Delaware, which occurred in January 2019, has placed at risk, voidable and unenforceable, all and any liabilities
that may have accrued, including any material agreements the Company may have executed during the period between March 22, 2011 and January
2019. To the best of our knowledge, no such liabilities that were accrued and no material agreement were entered into by the company
during the period between March 22, 2011 and January 2019. In addition, there could be penalties or legal liabilities that may have accrued
as a result of conducting business from 2011 to 2019 without properly registering with any State. To the best of our knowledge, as at
September 7, 2020, no such penalties or liabilities has accrued to the company accrued as a result of conducting business from 2011 to
2019 without properly registering with any State. However, there is no guarantee that such penalties or liabilities would not accrue
or arise in the future.

On
October 21, 2019, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated October 2, 2019, Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., a California corporation,
purchased one (1) million shares of its preferred shares (one preferred share is convertible 1,000 share of common stocks) of the Company,
representing 97.82 of our total issued and outstanding voting shares of common stock and preferred stock. Simultaneously with the purchase,
the officers and directors of the Company resigned. Frank I Igwealor, Chairman and CEO, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director; Patience
C Ogbozor, Director; and Dr. Solomon SK Mbagwu, MD, Director, were elected to replace them. Following the share sales to Cannabinoid
Biosciences, Inc., the purchaser converted 900,000 of the preferred shares for 900,000,000 shares of the Company s current outstanding
shares of common stock. 

Following
the consummation of the October 21, 2019 transactions, the Company decided to restart filing important information immediately. The Company
used the Form 10-12(g) to register its common stock with the SEC. 

On
September 15, 2020, Kid Castle Educational Corporation (the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with certain
corporation related to our President and CEO with respect to the private placement of 900,000 shares of its preferred stock at a purchase
price of 3 in cash and a transfer of 100 interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (a California Limited
Liability Company). The shares were issued to the investors without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 based upon exemptions
from registration provided under Section 4(2) of the Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The issuance did not involve any public
offering; no general solicitation or general advertising was used in connection with the offering. Community Economic Development Capital,
is a specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, medical
real estate investments, related commercial facilities, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related services. 

Similarly,
on September 16, 2020, as part of its purchase of unregistered securities from certain corporation related to our President and CEO,
the Company, received 3.00 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, and in exchange transferred 100 interest in, and control
of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC CED Capital ), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97 of the issued
and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), to GiveMePower Corporation, a Nevada corporation. This
transaction gave the Company 88 of the voting control of GiveMePower. 

On
April 21, 2021, the Company sold Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation, to Premier Information
Management, Inc. for 1 in cash. As further consideration pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned Kid Castle Educational Inc., the
parent Company of GMPW, the 100,000 shares of KDCE preferred stock and 900,000,000 shares of KDCE common stock that CBDX bought in October
of 2019. Pursuant to the April 21, 2021 transaction, CBDX ceased from being a subsidiary of GMPW, effective April 1, 2021. 

On
December 30, 2021, in exchange for its 87 control block in GiveMePower Corporation, the Company received 100 stake in Alpharidge Capital
LLC from GiveMePower, in a cashless transaction, resulting in each public company going its separate way as an independent company. 

30 

On
January 12, 2024, due to the company s need to simplify its balance sheet in order to approach the regulators to remove the Caveat
Emptor tag from the company s OTC Market profile, the company sold Alpharidge Capital LLC, its main operating subsidiary to American
Community Capital, LP., a California limited partnership controlled by our President and CEO Mr. Frank I Igwealor, in exchange for cash
payment of 1,560,992 payable in two hundred and forty (240) equal monthly payments of 6510, beginning on July 1, 2024. As at the time
of confirmation of the transaction, the combined average market capitalization of NIHK and KDCE was 1,086,677 729,482 for NIHK, and
 357,195 for KDCE), showing the FAIR MARKET value of the two parents of Alpharidge to have a combined market value of 1,086,677. 

Strategy 

As
the subsidiary of Video River Networks, Inc. (NIHK), the Company s business plan is to help NIHK to achieve its business plan.
The Company therefore will focus on rolling up Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets and businesses
in North America. 

Our
vision is to acquire and rollup profitable Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets across the United
States of America. There is no guarantee that we could successfully make any acquisition or rollup. Our mission as stated above is only
a guiding principle as we start our acquisition. We have never made any big acquisition prior to this moment. Although we have a theoretical
picture of what our mission called for, none of our staff have ever done it previously. 

Plan
of Operations for the Next Twelve Months 

Kid
Castle will need approximately 1,500,000 to sustain operations for the next 12 months. Our plan is to achieve meaningful revenue from
acquisitions of profitable rollup of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital
assets businesses that meet our operating needs. However, we may not be able to increase our revenue sufficiently to meet these
needs in time. It is also unlikely that we will be able to generate 1,500,000 in net income to satisfy all of our obligations and cover
our operating cost for the next 12 months. Our ability to continue operations will be dependent upon the successfully long-term or permanent
capital in form of equity financing, the support of creditors and shareholders, and, ultimately, the achievement of profitable operations.
There can be no assurances that we will be successful, which would in turn significantly affect our ability to be successful in our new
business plan. If not, we will likely be required to reduce operations or liquidate assets. We will continue to evaluate our projected
expenditures relative to our available cash and to seek additional means of financing in order to satisfy our working capital and other
cash requirements. 

We
intend to implement the following tasks within the next twelve months: 

1. 
 Month 1-3: Phase 1 (1-3 months in duration; 600,000 to 1
million in estimated fund receipt) 

a. 
 Hire 2 business development manager and officer manager to
implement our business plan. 

b. 
 Acquire and consolidate stakes in the operations of at least
two select Ai, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets and biopharma businesses. 

31 

2. 
 Month 3-6 Phase 2 (1-3 months in duration; cost control, process
improvements, admin management.). 

a. 
 Integrate acquired business into the Company s model
 consolidate the operations of the businesses including integration of their accounting and finance systems, synchronization of
their operating systems, and harmonization of their human resources functions. 

b. 
 Complete and file quarterly reports and other required filings
for the quarter 

3. 
 Month 6-9: Phase 3 (1-3 months in duration; 600,000 to 900,000
in estimated fund receipt) 

a. 
 Identify and acquire complementary/similar businesses or assets
in the target market 

4. 
 Month 9-12: Phase 4 (1-3 months duration; use acquired businesses 
free cash flow for more acquisitions) 

a. 
 Run the businesses efficiently, giving employees a conducive
and friendly workplace and add value to investors and shareholders by identifying and reducing excesses and also identifying and executing
growth strategies 

b. 
 Acquire more businesses that are below their book-value or
undervalued businesses, restructure the businesses, and sell the businesses for profit or hold them for cash flow. 

5. 
 Operating expenses during the twelve months would be as follows: 

a. 
 For the six months through May 31, 2025, we anticipate to incur
general and other operating expenses of 388,000. 

b. 
 For the six months through November 30, 2025 we anticipate
to incur additional general and other operating expenses of 378,000. 

The
execution of our current plan of operations requires us to raise significant additional capital immediately. If we are successful in
raising capital through the sale of shares or borrowing, we believe that the Company will have sufficient cash resources to fund its
plan of operations for the next twelve months. 

If
we are unable to do so, our ability to continue as a going concern will be in jeopardy, likely causing us to curtail and possibly cease
operations. 

32 

We
continually evaluate our plan of operations discussed above to determine the manner in which we can most effectively utilize our limited
cash resources. The timing of completion of any aspect of our plan of operations is highly dependent upon the availability of cash to
implement that aspect of the plan and other factors beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will successfully obtain the required
capital or revenues, or, if obtained, that the amounts will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations. The inability to secure additional
capital would have a material adverse effect on us, including the possibility that we would have to sell or forego a portion or all of
our assets or cease operations. If we discontinue our operations, we will not have sufficient funds to pay any amounts to our stockholders. 

Even
if we raise additional capital in the near future, if our current business plan is not successfully executed, our ability to fund our
biopharmaceutical research and development, or our financial product deployment and services efforts would likely be seriously impaired.
The ability of a biopharmaceutical research and development business and continuing operations is conditioned upon moving the development
of products and services toward commercialization. If in the future we are not able to demonstrate adequate progress in the development
and commercialization of our product, we will not be able to raise the capital we need to continue our business operations and business
activities, and we will likely not have sufficient liquidity or cash resources to continue operating. 

Because
our working capital requirements depend upon numerous factors there can be no assurance that our current cash resources will be sufficient
to fund our operations. At present, we have no committed external sources of capital, and do not expect any significant product revenues
for the foreseeable future. Thus, we will require immediate additional financing to fund future operations. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be able to obtain funds on acceptable terms, if at all. 

MERGERS
AND ACQUISITION 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

We
used the acquisition method of accounting (also known as business combination accounting) for acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group
method to account for the purchase of businesses. The
cost of the acquisition was measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed
at the date of exchange. 

Competition 

Our
business is highly competitive. We are in direct competition with more established biopharmaceutical companies, private equity firms,
private investors and management companies. Many management companies offer similar products and services for business rollups and consolidations.
We may be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out acquisition, operations and
restructuring efforts. These competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger capital-base, marketing,
research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor
and development costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging opportunities and changes in customer requirements
or devote greater resources to the development, acquisition and promotion. 

Increased
competition could result in us failing to attract significant capital or maintaining them. If we are unable to compete successfully against
current and future competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed. 

33 

We
hope to maintain our competitive advantage by keeping abreast of market dynamism that is face by our industry, and by utilizing the experience,
knowledge, and expertise of our management team. Moreover, we believe that we distinguish ourselves in the ways our model envisaged transformation
of businesses. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
activities currently are subject to no particular regulation by governmental agencies other than that routinely imposed on corporate
businesses. However, we may be subject to the rules governing acquisition and disposition of businesses, real estates and personal properties
in each of the state where we have our operations. We may also be subject to various state laws designed to protect buyers and sellers
of businesses. We cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or our business model. Once we commence our biopharmaceutical
operations, we would be subject to many regulations that apply to pharmaceutical and medical industry participants. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
currently have no patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property. We do not consider the grant of patents, trademarks
or other registered intellectual property essential to the success of our business. 

Employees 

We
do not have a W-2 employee at the present. Frank Ikechukwu Igwealor, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
is our only full-time staff As of September 30, 2024, pending when we could formalize an employment contract for him. In addition to
Mr. Igwealor, we have three part-time unpaid staff who helps with bookkeeping and administrative chores. Most of our part-time staff,
officers, and directors will devote their time as needed to our business and are expect to devote at least 15 hours per week to our business
operations. We plan on formalizing employment contract for those staff currently helping us without pay. Furthermore, in the immediate
future, we intend to use independent contractors and consultants to assist in many aspects of our business on an as needed basis pending
financial resources being available. We may use independent contractors and consultants once we receive sufficient funding to hire additional
employees. Even then, we will principally rely on independent contractors for substantially all of our technical and marketing needs. 

The
Company has no written employment contract or agreement with any person. Currently, we are not actively seeking additional employees
or engaging any consultants through a formal written agreement or contract. Services are provided on an as-needed basis to date. This
may change in the event that we are able to secure financing through equity or loans to the Company. As our company grows, we expect
to hire more full-time employees.

Operating
Expenses Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 44,924 as compared to 208,906 in the

months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Net Income was singularly related to the disposition of an operating subsidiary in exchange
for cash payment of 1,560,992 payable in two hundred and forty (240) equal monthly payments of 6,510, beginning on July 1, 2024. 

OCI
- Unrealized Gain or Other Comprehensive Income for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,560,992 , as compared to Unrealized
gain of 0, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a result of the disposition of an operating subsidiary in exchange
for cash payment of 1,560,992 payable in two hundred and forty (240) equal monthly payments of 6,510. 

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital of 78,120, consisting of twelve months of due from its Trade Receivable of
monthly 6,510, and 0 in short-term liabilities. 

For
the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 43,849 on operating activities, generated cash of 0 from investing
activities, and generated cash of 43,849 from financing activities, resulting in an decrease in total cash of 0 and a cash balance
of 0 for the period. For the nine months period ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated 817,755 from operating activities,
generated cash of 496,328 from investing activities, and used cash of 1,359,351 on financing activities, resulting in an decrease in
total cash of 45,268 and a cash balance of 19,166 for the period. 

As
of September 30, 2024, total stockholders equity decreased to 1,517,143 from 3,492,609 as of December 31, 2023, accounting for
the year-to-date operating expenses of 44,924 plus 1,945,693 operating unit disposition write-off related to the disposition of an
operating subsidiary in exchange for 1,560,992 payable in two hundred and forty (240) equal monthly payments of 6,510. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 0 (i.e. cash is used to fund operations). The Company does believe our current
cash balances will be sufficient to allow us to fund our operating plan for the next twelve months, therefore it would continue to depend
on cash advances from its directors and officers to finance its operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is still dependent
on us obtaining adequate capital to fund operation or maintaining consecutive quarterly profitability. If we are unable to obtain adequate
capital, or maintaining consecutive quarterly profitability, we could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail its drug
development activities. These conditions could raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

35 

Our
principal sources of liquidity are: (1) Crypto Currency Mining, (2) Real Estate Sales, and (3) Trading Securities. In the past, we have
been generating cash from loans to us by our major shareholder. In order to be able to achieve our strategic goals, we need to further
expand our business and implement our business plan. To continue to develop our business plan and generate sales, significant capital
has been and will continue to be required. Management intends to fund future operations through private or public equity and/or debt
offerings. We continue to engage in preliminary discussions with potential investors and broker-dealers, but no terms have been agreed
upon. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any equity
financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders. We do not currently have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt
and, accordingly we could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to finance operations. Any such indebtedness could contain covenants
which would restrict our operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated
by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has
defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial
condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Based
on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed which are described in Note 2 to our
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions
and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these
estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

We
are exposed to market risk, including changes in certain interest rates. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business,
as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. We have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in
connection with such fluctuations. 

This
analysis does not take into consideration the effect of changes in the level of overall economic activity on interest rate fluctuations. 

36 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 13a-15(b), we have carried out an evaluation
(the Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our management, and the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures As of September 30, 2024. Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below, in order to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure (see below for further discussion).We had
neither the resources, nor the personnel, to provide an adequate control environment. 

Due
to our limited resources, the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at September
30, 2024: 

we
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

we
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our limited size
 and early stage nature of operations, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically
 feasible; however, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
 should be performed by separate individuals; 

we
 do not have an independent audit committee of our Board of Directors; 

insufficient
 monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals with current knowledge
 of GAAP that led to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements; and 

we
 continue to outsource the functions of controller on an interim basis to assist us in implementing the necessary financial controls
 over the financial reporting and the utilization of internal management and staff to effectuate these controls. 

37 

We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily related, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in GAAP
and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the
lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems. 

If
and when our financial resources allow, we plan to take a number of actions to correct these material weaknesses including, but not limited
to, establishing an audit committee of our Board of Directors comprised of three independent directors, hiring a full-time Chief Financial
Officer, adding experienced accounting and financial personnel and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls
and recommend improvements. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred as of September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. Legal Proceedings 

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred within the past ten years concerning our directors or officers which involved a criminal
conviction, a criminal proceeding, an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one s participation in the securities or banking
industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations. 

From
time to time we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of the operation of our business in the normal course of
business. Other than as described below, as of the date of this Registration Statement we are not aware of potential dispute or pending
litigation and are not currently involved in a litigation proceeding or governmental actions the outcome of which in management s
opinion would be material to our financial condition or results of operations. An adverse result in these or other matters may have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

On
July 1, 2024, the Company received a Wells Notice which advised that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has made a preliminary
determination to recommend that the Commission file an enforcement action against GiveMePower, Inc. The Notice showed that the proposed
action would allege violations of Securities Act of 1933 Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3); and Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(a), (b), (c) thereunder; and Exchange Act Sections 13(a)
and 13(k) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. The Notice s recommendation may involve a civil injunctive action and the commission
may seek remedies that include an injunction and civil money penalties. The Company s attorneys are presently working on an appropriate
response to the Notice.
