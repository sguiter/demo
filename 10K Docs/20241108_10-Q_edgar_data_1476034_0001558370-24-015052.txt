In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (ASC 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provided optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (ASC 848): Deferral of Sunset Date of Topic 848, which deferred the sunset date of ASC 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024 because the current relief in ASC 848 did not cover the June 30, 2023 cessation date for the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, obligations of U.S. State and Municipal securities were rated investment grade and the associated ACL was immaterial. AFS securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses on a quarterly basis. The unrealized losses on AFS securities are primarily due to the changes in market interest rates subsequent to purchase. In addition, the Company does not intend, nor would it be required, to sell these investments until there is a full recovery of the unrealized loss, which may be at maturity. As a result, ACL was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Assets and Liabilities Not Measured on a Recurring Basis The Company has engaged independent pricing service providers to provide the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value. These providers follow FASB s exit pricing guidelines, as required by ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement, when calculating the fair market value. Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and overnight deposits. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to equal their carrying values, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. For securities and the disability fund, if quoted market prices are not available for a specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. These pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices, and credit spreads. The estimated fair value of loans are measured at amortized cost using an exit price notion. Ownership in equity securities of the FRB and FHLB is generally restricted and there is no established liquid market for their resale. The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., money market and savings deposits, and non-interest-bearing demand deposits) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. Time deposits are valued using a replacement cost of funds approach. Trust preferred securities are valued using a replacement cost of funds approach. For all other assets and liabilities it is assumed that the carrying value equals their current fair value. material assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not carried at fair value were as follows (in thousands):

 million regulatory reserve to resolve a state agency investigation connected with this matter. In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various other pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of its business activities, as well as inquiries and investigations from regulators. While the future outcome of litigation or regulatory matters cannot be determined at this time, in the opinion of management, as of September 30, 2024, the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of any such other pending or threatened matters are not expected to be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Global Payments Group revenue Other service charges and fees Total A description of the Company s revenue streams accounted for under the accounting guidance is as follows: Service charges on deposit accounts The Company offers business and personal retail products and services, which include, but are not limited to, online banking, mobile banking, Automated Clearing House ACH transactions, and remote deposit capture. A standard deposit contract exists between the Company and all deposit clients. The Company earns fees from its deposit clients for transaction-based services (such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees), account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the client s request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the client s account balance. Global payment group revenue The Company offers corporate cash management and retail banking services and, through its global payments business, provides services to non-bank financial service companies. The Company earns initial set-up fees for these programs as well as fees for transactions processed. The Company receives transaction data at the end of each month for services rendered, at which time revenue is recognized. Additionally, service charges specific to GPG clients deposits are recognized within GPG revenue. Other service charges The primary component of other service charges relates to letter of credit fees and FX conversion fees. The Company outsources FX conversion for foreign currency transactions to correspondent banks. The Company earns a portion of an FX conversion fee that the client charges to process an FX conversion transaction. Revenue is recognized at the end of the month once the client has remitted the transaction information to the Company.

The derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges of certain deposit liabilities and borrowings of the Company. The hedges were determined to be highly effective during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects the hedges to remain highly effective during the remaining term of the derivatives. In addition, the Company periodically enters into certain commercial loan interest rate swap agreements to provide commercial loan clients the ability to convert loans from variable to fixed interest rates. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable-rate loan agreement with a client in addition to a swap agreement. This swap agreement effectively converts the client s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client agreement. As the interest rate swap agreements with the clients and third parties are not designated as hedges, the instruments are marked to market in earnings. At September 30, 2024, these interest rate swaps have a notional amount of million and a contractual maturity of August 15, 2028.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Company Background The Company is a bank holding company headquartered in New York, New York and registered under the BHC Act. Through its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Metropolitan Commercial Bank (the Bank ), a New York state chartered commercial bank, the Company provides a broad range of business, commercial and retail banking products and services to small businesses, middle-market enterprises, public entities and individuals primarily in the New York metropolitan area. See the Glossary of Common Terms and Acronyms for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-Q. The Company s primary market includes the New York metropolitan area, specifically Manhattan and the outer boroughs, and Nassau County, New York. This market is well-diversified and represents a large market for middle market businesses (defined as businesses with annual revenue of 5 million to 400 million). The Company s market area has a diversified economy typical of most urban population centers, with the majority of employment provided by services, wholesale/retail trade, finance/insurance/real estate, technology companies and construction. A relationship-led strategy has provided the Company with select opportunities in other U.S. markets, with a particular focus on South Florida. The Company s primary lending products are CRE, including multi-family loans, and C I loans. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business and consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows from operations of commercial enterprises. The Company s primary deposit products are checking, savings, and term deposit accounts, all of which are insured by the FDIC under the maximum amounts allowed by law. The Company has developed various deposit gathering strategies, which generate the funding necessary to operate without a large branch network. These activities, together with six strategically located banking centers, generate a stable source of deposits and a diverse loan portfolio with attractive risk-adjusted yields. The Company operates six banking centers strategically located within close proximity to target clients. The strength of the Company s deposit franchise comes from its long-standing relationships with clients and the strong ties it has in its market area. The Company has also developed a diversified funding strategy, which enables it to be less reliant on branches. Deposit funding is provided by the following core deposit verticals: (i) borrowing clients; (ii) non-borrowing retail clients; (iii) corporate cash management clients; (iv) municipal and other local entities; (v) EB-5 Program accounts; and (vi) Title and Escrow and Charter School clients. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy, which involves the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, is the allowance for credit losses. Allowance for Credit Losses The ACL has been determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company is responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the ACL. Management believes that the ACL for loans and loan commitments is adequate to cover expected credit losses over the life of the loan portfolio. Although management evaluates available information to determine the adequacy of the ACL, the level of allowance is an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Because of uncertainties associated with local and national economic forecasts, the operating and regulatory environment, collateral values and future cash flows from the loan portfolio, it is possible that a material change could occur in the ACL. The evaluation of the adequacy of loan collateral is often based upon estimates and appraisals. Because of uncertain economic conditions, the valuations determined from such estimates and appraisals may change. Accordingly, the Company may ultimately incur losses that vary from management s current estimates. Adjustments to 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 the ACL will be reported in the period in which such adjustments become known and can be reasonably estimated. All loan losses are charged to the ACL when the loss actually occurs or when the collectability of principal is deemed to be unlikely. Recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s ACL. As a result of such examinations, the Company may need to recognize additions to the ACL based on the regulators observations. In estimating the ACL, the Company relies on models and economic forecasts developed by external parties as the primary driver of the ACL. These external models and forecasts are based on nationwide data sets. Economic forecasts can change significantly over an economic cycle and have a significant level of uncertainty associated with them. The performance of these models is dependent on the variables used in the models being reasonable predictors for the loan portfolio s performance. However, these variables may not capture all sources of risk within the portfolio. As a result, the Company reviews the results and makes qualitative adjustments to capture potential limitations of the external models as necessary. Such qualitative factors may include adjustments to better capture the imprecision associated with the economic forecasts, and the ability of the models to capture emerging risks within the portfolio that may not be represented in the data. These adjustments are evaluated through the Company s review process and revised on a quarterly basis to account for changes in forecasts, facts and circumstances. One of the more significant judgments involved in estimating the Company s ACL relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses and the relative weightings applied to them. To illustrate the impact of changes in these forecasts to the Company s ACL, the Company performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis that decreased the weight on the baseline scenario by 33 and equally allocated the difference to increase the weights on the more optimistic and adverse scenarios. All else equal, the impact of this hypothetical forecast would result in a net increase of approximately 6.8 million, or 10.9 , in the Company s total ACL for loans and loan commitments as of September 30, 2024. This hypothetical analysis is intended to illustrate the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic forecasts at a point in time and is not intended to reflect the full nature and extent of potential future change in the ACL. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one of the quantitative inputs or qualitative factors might affect the overall ACL and the Company s current assessments may not reflect the potential future impact of changes to those inputs or factors. Discussion of Financial Condition The Company had total assets of 7.4 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 335.7 million, or 4.7 , from December 31, 2023. Total cash and cash equivalents were 318.5 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 49.0 million, or 18.2 , from December 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects the 532.6 million increase in deposits, partially offset by the 289.1 million decrease in wholesale funding and the 272.3 million net deployment into loans. Investments Total securities were 954.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 22.4 million, or 2.4 , from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of 72.8 million of AFS securities, and the 19.1 million unrealized gain on AFS securities during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by the 68.1 million paydown and maturities of AFS and HTM securities. Loans Total loans, net of deferred fees and unamortized costs, were 5.9 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 272.3 million, or 4.8 , from December 31, 2023. The increase in total loans was due primarily to an increase of 315.1 million in CRE loans (including owner-occupied) and 41.9 million in one-to four-family loans, partially offset by a 123.4 million decrease in multi-family loans. At September 30, 2024, 79.9 of the CRE and C I loan portfolio is concentrated in the New York Metropolitan Area (mainly New York City) and Florida.

The Company recorded a 4.8 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflects loan growth, a provision related to a single C I loan, and a modest increase in the duration of the Company s loan portfolio. Deposits Total deposits were 6.3 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 532.6 million, or 9.3 , from December 31, 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023, was due primarily to broad based increases across most of the Company s various deposit verticals. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits were 28.4 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 32.0 at December 31, 2023. The table below summarizes the Company s deposit composition by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):

 Borrowings To support the balance sheet, the Company may at times utilize FHLB advances or other funding sources. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 150.0 million of FHLBNY advances. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 99.0 million of Federal funds purchased and 440.0 million of FHLBNY advances. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a 100.0 million FRB term loan under the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ). The Federal Reserve established the BTFP on March 12, 2023, as a funding source for eligible depository institutions. Advances can no longer be requested under the program. The BTFP was created to provide short-term liquidity (up to one year) against the par value of certain high-quality collateral, such as U.S. Treasury securities. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, was 44.1 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8.8 million from December 31, 2023. The decrease from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to unrealized gains on AFS securities, as a result of changes in prevailing interest rates, partially offset by net unrealized losses on outstanding cash flow hedges. Results of Operations Net Income Net income was 12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 9.8 million as compared to 22.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was due primarily to a 20.3 million increase in non-interest expense, partially offset by a 11.7 million increase in net interest income Net income was 45.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 17.4 million as compared to 62.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due primarily to a 41.0 million increase in non-interest expense, partially offset by a 20.6 million increase in net interest income. Net Interest Income Analysis Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities. The following table presents an analysis of net interest income by each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table presents the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Yields and costs were derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances were derived from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that management considers to be adjustments to yields. Yields on tax-exempt obligations were not computed on a tax-equivalent basis. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan origination fees and costs, and purchase discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income.

 (1) Annualized. (2) Amount includes deferred loan fees and non-performing loans. (3) Determined by subtracting the annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized average yield on total interest-earning assets. (4) Determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets. (5) Determined by dividing annualized interest expense on deposits by total average interest-bearing and non-interest bearing deposits. (6) Determined by dividing annualized interest expense by the sum of total average interest-bearing liabilities and total average non-interest-bearing deposits. Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.62 compared to 3.27 for the third quarter of 2023. The 35 basis point increase was due primarily to an increase in the average balance of loans, an increase in the yield for loans, elevated prepayment penalties and deferred fee recognition as a result of an increased level of loan payoffs, and a decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of deposits and an increase in the cost of funds. Net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.49 compared to 3.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 4 basis point decrease was due primarily to the shift from non-interest bearing deposits to interest bearing deposits related to the exit from the crypto-related deposit vertical, and, moreover, the increase in the cost of funds, partially offset by loan growth and the increase in the yield for loans in combination with elevated prepayment penalties and deferred fee recognition as a result of an increased level of loan payoffs. Interest Income Interest income increased 22.6 million to 120.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 97.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans and an increase in the yield for loans

 in combination with elevated prepayment penalties and deferred fee recognition as a result of an increased level of loan payoffs. The average balance of loans increased 606.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The yield on loans increased 72 basis points for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to the increase in prevailing market interest rates and a disciplined approach to loan pricing. Interest income increased 78.4 million to 348.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 270.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans and an increase in the yield for loans in combination with elevated prepayment penalties and deferred fee recognition as a result of an increased level of loan payoffs. The average balance of loans increased 764.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on loans increased 77 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in prevailing market interest rates and a disciplined approach to loan pricing. Interest Expense Interest expense increased 10.9 million to 55.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 44.3 million for the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to the increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and an increase in the cost of funds, partially offset by the decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 851.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, which reflects deposit growth and the shift from non-interest bearing deposits to interest bearing deposits primarily related to the exit from the crypto-related deposit vertical in 2023. The total cost of funds for the third quarter of 2024 increased 36 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023, which reflects the continued effects of high short-term interest rates, intense competition for deposits, and the shift from non-interest bearing deposits to interest bearing funding related to the exit from the crypto-related deposit vertical. The average balance of borrowed funds decreased 301.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, which reflects a disciplined approach to liquidity management. Interest expense increased 57.8 million to 162.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 104.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and an increase in the cost of funds. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects deposit growth and the shift from non-interest bearing deposits to interest bearing deposits primarily related to the exit from the crypto-related deposit vertical in 2023. The total cost of funds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 87 basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects the continued effects of high short-term interest rates, intense competition for deposits, and the shift from non-interest bearing deposits to interest bearing funding. Provision for Credit Losses Loans and Loan Commitments The provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.7 million and 4.8 million, respectively, which reflects loan growth, a provision related to a single C I loan, and a modest increase in the duration of the Company s loan portfolio. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income decreased 228,000 to 6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven primarily by lower GPG revenue, partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit accounts. At the beginning of 2024, the Company announced that it will exit all GPG Banking-as-a-Service relationships, which is expected to be completed during 2024. Non-interest income decreased 1.9 million to 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven primarily by lower GPG revenue, partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit accounts.

 Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense increased 20.3 million to 51.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to a pre-tax 10.0 million regulatory reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2024, a 2.7 million increase in compensation and benefits related to the increase in number of employees, and a 1.8 million increase in technology costs related to the digital transformation initiative. At the beginning of 2024, the Company began implementing an innovative digital transformation project to improve its capabilities and efficiencies for both client facing and internal processes, which it expects to complete in 2025. Non-interest expense increased 41.0 million to 135.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a pre-tax 10 million regulatory reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 9.5 million in compensation and benefits due to severance expenses related to the GPG wind down and the increase in number of employees, an increase of 4.6 million in professional fees primarily related to regulatory remediation costs, and an increase of 5.1 million in technology costs primarily related to the digital transformation project. Income Tax Expense The estimated effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 30.2 as compared to 22.2 for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 reflects a discrete tax item related to the exercise of stock options in the third quarter of 2023 and the reversal of the regulatory settlement reserve in that period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.1 compared to 28.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its clients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 611.9 million in unused loan commitments and 36.6 million in standby and commercial letters of credit. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 595.1 million in unused commitments and 59.5 million in standby and commercial letters of credit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to economically meet current and future financial obligations. The Company s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities, securities cash flows and borrowings. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities and borrowings are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, mortgage prepayments and securities sales are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates and changes thereto, economic conditions and competition. The Company regularly reviews the need to adjust investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of: (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of its asset/liability program. Excess liquidity is generally invested in interest earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities. The Company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on its operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled 318.5 million and 269.5 million, respectively. Securities, which provide an additional source of liquidity, totaled 954.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 932.2 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there were 782.6 million of securities pledged to support wholesale funding, and to a lesser extent certain other types of deposits, of which 172.7 million were encumbered. At December 31, 2023, there were 845.7

 million of securities pledged to support wholesale funding, and to a lesser extent certain other types of deposits, of which 60.0 million were encumbered. The Company s primary investing activities are the origination of loans, and to a lesser extent, the purchase of loans and securities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s loan production was 460.6 million and 1.0 billion as compared to 333.5 million and 1.0 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing activities consisted primarily of activity in deposit accounts and borrowings. The Company gathers deposits from businesses and individuals through client referrals and other relationships and through its retail presence. The Company has established deposit concentration thresholds to avoid the possibility of dependence on any single depositor base for funds. Total deposits were 6.3 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 532.6 million, or 9.3 , from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, interest-bearing deposits were comprised of 4.4 billion of money market accounts and 89.4 million of time deposits. Time deposits due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 73.5 million, or 1.2 , of total deposits. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate estimated amount of FDIC uninsured deposits was 1.6 billion. At December 31, 2023, interest-bearing deposits were comprised of 3.9 billion of money market accounts and 35.4 million of time deposits. Time deposits due within one year December 31, 2023 totaled 31.8 million or 0.6 of total deposits. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 28.4 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, as compared to 32.0 at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate estimated amount of FDIC uninsured deposits was 1.6 billion. In the event loan demand were to increase faster than expected, or any other unforeseen demand or commitment were to occur, the Company could access its borrowing capacity with the FHLB or obtain additional funds through alternative funding sources, including the brokered deposit market. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 150.0 million of outstanding FHLBNY advances and a 100.0 million FRB term loan under the BTFP. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and available secured wholesale funding borrowing capacity of 3.1 billion.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General The principal objective of the Company s asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk within the balance sheet and pursue a controlled assumption of IRR while maximizing net income and preserving adequate levels of liquidity and capital. The Board of Directors provides oversight of the Company s asset and liability management function, which is managed by the Company s ALCO. The ALCO has further assigned responsibility for the day-to-day management of IRR to the CFO, or his designee. The ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of earnings and the market value of assets and liabilities to market interest rate changes and local and national market conditions. That group also reviews liquidity, capital, deposit mix, loan mix and investment positions. Based upon the nature of its operations, the Company is not subject to FX or commodity price risk. Interest Rate Risk As a financial institution, the Company s primary market risk exposure is IRR. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most assets and liabilities, and the fair value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. IRR is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust, as deemed appropriate, the balance sheet to manage the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. The Company manages its exposure to interest rates primarily by prudently structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. The Company generally originates fixed and floating rate loans with maturities of less than five years. The IRR on these loans is offset to some degree by the mix and structure of the deposit portfolio. On occasion, the Company enters into derivative contracts as a part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its IRR position. Net Interest Income At-Risk The Company analyzes its net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a simulation model, which estimates what net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates, and then calculates what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning September 30, 2024 resulting from potential changes in interest rates, expressed in basis points. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income.

 Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of the Company s IRR exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and may differ from actual results. The following table indicates the sensitivity of projected annualized net interest income to the interest rate movements described above (dollars in thousands): 

At September 30, 2024 Change in Net Year 1 Interest Interest Change Rates Income Year 1 from (basis points) Forecast Level +400 223,790 (12.63) +300 231,593 (9.58) +200 239,419 (6.53) +100 248,287 (3.07) 256,141 -100 263,951 3.05 -200 272,783 6.50 -300 282,245 10.19 -400 293,161 14.45 The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, in the event of an instantaneous and sustained parallel upward shift of 200 basis points in interest rates, the Company would experience a 6.53 decrease in net interest income. In the event of an instantaneous and sustained parallel downward shift of 200 basis points in interest rates, it would experience a 6.5 increase in net interest income. Economic Value of Equity Analysis The Company also analyzes the sensitivity of its financial condition to changes in interest rates through an EVE model. This analysis measures the difference between predicted changes in the fair value of assets and predicted changes in the present value of liabilities assuming various changes in current interest rates. The table below represents an analysis of IRR as measured by the estimated changes in EVE, resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (+100, +200, +300 and +400 basis points and -100, -200, -300 and -400 basis points) at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 

Estimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE Change in Interest Rates Estimated (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Dollars Percent +400 384,607 (169,913) (30.64) +300 430,593 (123,927) (22.35) +200 476,125 (78,395) (14.14) +100 521,852 (32,668) (5.89) 554,520 -100 577,559 23,039 4.15 -200 587,970 33,450 6.03 -300 590,940 36,420 6.57 -400 564,459 9,939 1.79 

 (1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. (2) EVE is the fair value of expected cash flows from assets, less the fair value of the expected cash flows arising from the Company s liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts.

Table of Contents 
 The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate upward shift of 200 basis points in interest rates, the Company would experience a 14.14 decrease in its EVE. In the event of an immediate downward shift of 200 basis points in interest rates, the Company would experience a 6.03 increase in its EVE. The preceding simulation analyses do not represent a forecast of actual results and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions, which are subject to change, including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and others. Also, as market conditions vary, prepayment/refinancing levels, the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps and floors embedded in adjustable-rate loans, early withdrawal of deposits, changes in product preferences, and other internal/external variables will likely deviate from those assumed. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company s principal executive officer, and the Chief Financial Officer, who is the Company s principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In addition, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
