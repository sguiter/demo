 components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are borne by the Company s stockholders, unless such fees are waived by MC Advisors. 
 On April 18, 2022, MC Advisors agreed to permanently waive a portion of the base management fees and incentive fees payable by the Company to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement pursuant to a fee waiver letter. The base management fee waiver took effect beginning April 1, 2022 (the Effective Date and the incentive fee waivers took effect beginning January 1, 2022. 
 Beginning with the Effective Date, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of average total assets (reduced from ), which includes assets financed using leverage. Following any future quotation or listing of the Company s securities on a national securities exchange (an Exchange Listing or any future quotation or listing of its securities on any other public trading market, the base management fee will be calculated at an annual rate of of average invested assets (calculated as total assets excluding cash). The base management fee is payable in arrears. 
 Base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were and , respectively. Base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were and , respectively. 
 The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the preceding quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee), any expenses payable under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement between the Company and Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC MC Management and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income will include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. MC Advisors is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the incentive fee it receives that was based on accrued interest that the Company never actually receives. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains or losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. If any distributions from portfolio companies are characterized as a return of capital, such returns of capital would affect the capital gains incentive fee to the extent a gain or loss is realized. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where it incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if it has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed hurdle rate of per quarter annually). 
 As of and beginning with the Effective Date, prior to an Exchange Listing, the Company shall pay MC Advisors an incentive fee with respect to its pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of annually);

 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than (reduced from pursuant to the fee waiver letter effective April 1, 2022) in any calendar quarter prior to an Exchange Listing or in any calendar quarter following an Exchange Listing. This portion of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income is referred to as the catch-up provision; and 
 prior to an Exchange Listing, of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income (a reduction from of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net income), if any, that exceeds (reduced from pursuant to the fee waiver letter effective April 1, 2022) in any calendar quarter, and following an Exchange Listing, of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter. 
 These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 
 The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals (reduced from effective January 1, 2022 pursuant to the fee waiver letter) of the Company s realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to MC Advisors, the Company calculates the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since the Company s inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in the Company s portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the amortized cost of such investment. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the amortized cost of such investment since the Company s inception. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the amortized cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that will serve as the basis for the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to the Company s portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year equals of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in respect of the Company s portfolio in all prior years. 
 While the Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, the Company includes unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if the Company s entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.

 and , respectively, in outstanding commitments to fund investments under undrawn revolvers, delayed draw commitments and subscription agreements. Management believes that the Company s available cash balances and/or ability to draw on existing credit facilities or raise additional leverage facilities provide sufficient funds to cover its unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024. 
 Indemnification: In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnification. The Company s maximum exposure under these agreements is unknown, as these involve future claims that may be made against the Company but that have not occurred. The Company expects the risk of any future obligations under these indemnification provisions to be remote. 
 Concentration of credit and counterparty risk: Credit risk arises primarily from the potential inability of counterparties to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. In the event that the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties or issuers of the instruments. It is the Company s policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each counterparty. 
 Market risk: The Company s investments and borrowings are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments and borrowings are traded. 
 Legal proceedings: In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that are generally incidental to its ongoing operations. While there can be no assurance of the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings, the Company is not currently aware of any such proceedings or disposition that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 (1) The per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the periods presented. 
 (2) The per share data for distributions reflects the actual amount of distributions declared during the period. Management monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the year. To the extent the Company s taxable earnings fall below the total amount of the Company s distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a tax return of capital to the Company s stockholders. The tax character of distributions will be determined at the end of the fiscal year. However, if the character of such distributions were determined as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, none of the distributions would have been characterized as a tax return of capital to the Company s stockholders; this tax return of capital may differ from the return of capital calculated with reference to net investment income for financial reporting purposes.

We expect to invest primarily in: (i) senior secured and junior secured and unsecured loans, notes, bonds, preferred equity (including preferred partnership equity), convertible debt and other securities; (ii) unitranche secured loans (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a first out portion of the loan to an investor and retain a last out portion of the loan) and securities; (iii) asset-based loans and securities; (iv) small business loans and leases; (v) structured debt and structured equity; (vi) syndicated loans; (vii) securitized debt and subordinated notes of collateralized loan obligations facilities, asset-backed securities and other securitized products and warehouse loan facilities; (viii) opportunities to acquire illiquid investments from other third-party funds as a result of liquidity constraints resulting from investor redemptions and market dislocations; and (ix) capital investments in the secondary markets. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio included approximately 86.1 senior secured loans, 4.6 unitranche secured loans, 4.3 junior secured loans and 5.0 equity securities, compared to December 31, 2023, when our portfolio included approximately 85.9 senior secured loans, 7.3 unitranche secured loans, 3.5 junior secured loans and 3.3 equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buyouts or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard Poor s system) from the national rating agencies. 
 We use Monroe Capital s extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in senior secured, unitranche secured and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. Our investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We believe that our focus on lending to lower middle-market companies offers several advantages as compared to lending to larger companies, including more attractive economics, lower leverage, more comprehensive and restrictive covenants, more expansive events of default, relatively small debt facilities that provide us with enhanced influence over our borrowers, direct access to borrower management and improved information flow.

 Investment income 
 We generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche secured or junior secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind PIK interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments that trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recorded as other income in the period the service is completed. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company LLC and limited partnership LP investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. The frequency and volume of the distributions on common equity securities and LLC and LP investments may fluctuate significantly from period to period. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of base management and incentive fees to MC Advisors under the investment advisory agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Investment Advisory Agreement ), the payment of fees to MC Management for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the administration agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Administration Agreement ), and other operating costs. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and Related Party Transactions below for additional information on our Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on indebtedness. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. 
 Net gain (loss) 
 We recognize realized gains or losses on investments, foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency and other transactions based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized within net realized gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. We record current period changes in fair value of investments, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency and other transactions within net change in unrealized gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations.

 (1) The weighted average annualized contractual coupon yield at period end is computed by dividing (a) the interest income on our debt investments and preferred equity investments (with a stated coupon rate) at the period end contractual coupon rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments and the cost basis of our preferred equity investments. 
 (2) The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments at period end is computed by dividing (a) interest income on our debt investments and preferred equity investments (with a stated coupon rate) at the period end effective rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments and the cost basis of our preferred equity investments. The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments is a metric on the investment portfolio alone and does not represent a return to stockholders. This metric is not inclusive of our fees and expenses, the impact of leverage on the investment portfolio or sales load that may be paid by stockholders.

 Portfolio Asset Quality 
 MC Advisors portfolio management staff closely monitors all credits, with senior portfolio managers covering agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports. 
 110 

Table of Contents 

 As part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors investment performance risk rating. For any investment rated in Grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors, through its internal Portfolio Management Group PMG ), will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. The PMG is responsible for oversight and management of any investments rated in Grades 3, 4, or 5. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment performance risk ratings on a quarterly basis. The investment performance risk rating system is described as follows: 
 Investment 
 Performance 
 Risk Rating 
 Summary Description Grade 1 Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer s operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. Grade 2 Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. Grade 3 Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. Grade 4 Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). Grade 5 Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full. 
 Our investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 In the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment Grade 4 or Grade 5, the PMG, in consultation with the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower s management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors and the PMG will form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve our value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. The PMG and the investment committee have extensive experience in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.

 The increase in total investment income of 54.1 and 139.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, is primarily due to the increase in interest income and PIK interest income due to the growth of our investment portfolio and the higher base interest rates during the current year periods. Additionally, the current year periods included an increase in fee income stemming from portfolio investment realizations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations.

 The increase in total operating expenses of 32.5 million and 81.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, is primarily due to an increase in interest expense, driven by higher average borrowings to support the growth of the portfolio. Additionally, increases in base management fees driven by higher average invested assets, and incentive fees, resulting from higher net investment income contributed to the increase in operating expenses.

 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated, currently qualify and intend to continue to qualify annually as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax treatment available to RICs. To maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next year and pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates and a 4 excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net expense on the consolidated statements of operations of 0.2 million and 0.6 million for U.S. federal excise tax, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net expense on the consolidated statements of operations of 0.2 million and 0.5 million for U.S. federal excise tax, respectively. 
 Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net tax expense of zero and 0.1 million, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations for these subsidiaries. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net tax expense of zero and 39 thousand, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations for these subsidiaries. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had sales of investments of 28.0 million and 4.4 million, respectively, resulting in 0.5 million and 38 thousand of net realized gain (loss) on investments, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had sales of investments of 45.1 million and 9.0 million, respectively, resulting in 0.7 million and 0.6) million of net realized gain (loss) on investments, respectively. 
 We have entered and may continue to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 25) thousand and 2) thousand net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency forward contracts, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 23) thousand and 1.7 million net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency forward contracts, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 0.2) million and 10) thousand of net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 0.1) million and 0.2 million of net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions, respectively. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our investments had 10.0 million and 2.7) million of net change in unrealized gain (loss), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our investments had 15.2 million and (0.9) million of net change in unrealized gain (loss), respectively. The net change in unrealized gain (loss) includes both unrealized gain on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the periods and unrealized loss on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the periods. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized gain on investments was primarily attributable to broad market movements and improvements in fundamental performance at many of our portfolio companies, partially offset by net unrealized losses attributable to certain portfolio companies that have underlying credit performance concerns that were still held as of September 30, 2024. 
 During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net change in unrealized loss on investments was primarily attributable to unrealized losses on certain portfolio companies that have underlying credit or fundamental performance concerns that were still held as of September 30, 2023.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our foreign currency forward contracts had 1.8) million and 1.9 million of net change in unrealized gain (loss), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our foreign currency forward contracts had 0.1) million and 1.2) million of net change in unrealized gain (loss), respectively.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no foreign currency and other transactions. Net unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency and other transactions primarily relate to our foreign currency borrowings. 
 Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 58.2 million and 30.3 million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 0.34 and 0.30, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 152.9 million and 80.9 million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 0.99 and 0.92, respectively. 
 The 27.9 million and 72.0 million increases in net assets resulting from operations during the three and nine months ende d September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, is primarily the result of increased net investment income due to the significant portfolio growth and net gains on investments during the current year periods. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of private offerings, (ii) cash flows from our operations, and (iii) borrowings under our existing leverage facilities and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. These financings may come in the form of borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities. Our primary uses of cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying MC Advisors and reimbursements to MC Management), (iii) debt service of any borrowings, (iv) share repurchases under our share repurchase program and (v) cash distributions to our stockholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 20.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, 22.5 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents at MC Income Plus Financing SPV LLC (the SPV ), 19.9 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents at MC Income Plus Financing SPV II LLC (the SPV II ), 3.7 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents at MC Income Plus Financing SPV III LLC (the SPV III ), 6.1 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents at MC Income Plus Financing SPV IV LLC (the SPV IV ), 27.7 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents at Monroe Capital Income Plus ABS Funding, LLC (the 2022 Issuer and 10.2 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents at Monroe Capital Income Plus ABS Funding II, LLC (the 2023 Issuer ). Additionally, we had 1.9 billion in total debt outstanding with 130.4 million, 138.0 million, 40.0 million and 200.7 million available for additional borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), SPV Credit Facility (as defined below), SPV III Credit Facility (as defined below) and SPV IV Credit Facility (as defined below), respectively, subject to borrowing base availability. See Borrowings below for additional information. 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, we are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on aggregate borrowings outstanding was 200 and 204 , respectively.

 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we experienced a net increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash and cash equivalents of 32.8 million and 27.5 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in operating activities was 1.0 billion and 433.6 million, respectively, primarily driven by purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by proceeds from principal payments and sale of investments and settlement of forward contracts and net investment income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 1.0 billion and 461.2 million, respectively, primarily driven by net borrowings on our debt facilities and proceeds from issuances of common stock, partially offset by distributions to stockholders and repurchases of common stock. 
 Capital Resources 
 As a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities, including our current Second Private Offering and any subsequent offerings, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be to invest in portfolio companies, fund share repurchases under our share repurchase program and make cash distributions to our stockholders. We may also use available funds to repay outstanding borrowings. 
 As a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value NAV per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock if our Board, including our independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders have approved such sales. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 180,987,700 and 127,232,772 shares outstanding, respectively. 
 Distributions 
 Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the applicable record date. The amount, if any, to be distributed to stockholders is determined by our Board at least quarterly and is generally based upon our earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually. 
 The determination of the tax attributes for our distributions is made annually, based upon our taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and capital gains, but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital. Distributions to stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 49.3 million 0.29 per share) and 128.9 million 0.85 per share), respectively. Distributions to stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, totaled 27.4 million 0.28 per share) and 70.3 million 0.81 per share), respectively. The tax character of such distributions is determined at the end of the fiscal year. However, if the character of such distributions were determined as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, no portion of these distributions would have been characterized as a return of capital to stockholders. 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") that provides for the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions on behalf of its stockholders that elect to participate in such plan. As a result, if we declare a dividend or distribution, our stockholders cash distributions will only be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock if a stockholder specifically opts in to the DRIP at least ten (10) days prior to the record date fixed by our Board. Shares issued under the DRIP will be issued at a price per share equal to the NAV per share as of the last day of our fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date that the distribution was declared. On August 23, 2024, the Board approved an amended and restated dividend reinvestment plan (the "Amended and Restated DRIP"), which was amended solely to appoint UMB Fund Services, Inc., as the Plan Administrator (as defined in the Amended and Restated DRIP). See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our distributions and Amended and Restated DRIP.

 Credit Facilities 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On October 20, 2023, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement ), with ING Capital, LLC, as administrative agent and joint lead arranger. 
 The initial principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility was 295.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on our portfolio investments and other outstanding indebtedness, with an accordion provision to permit increases to the total facility amount up to 450.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. On December 22, 2023, March 18, 2024 and June 27, 2024, we increased the facility amount pursuant to the accordion feature of the Revolving Credit Facility from 295.0 million of aggregate commitments to 325.0 million, 350.0 million and 385.0 million, respectively, of aggregate commitments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of 188.0 million and 240.8 million, respectively, and non-U.S. dollar borrowings denominated in Australian dollars of AUD 22.0 million 15.2 million in U.S. dollars) and AUD 23.5 million 16.0 million in U.S. dollars), respectively, and Great Britain pounds of 38.4 million 51.4 million in U.S. dollars) and zero, respectively. The borrowings denominated in a foreign currency may be positively or negatively affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the respective foreign currency. These movements are beyond our control and cannot be predicted. The borrowings denominated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date. The impact resulting from changes in foreign currency borrowings is included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions on our consolidated statements of operations and totaled 3.0) million and 2.7) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and zero for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Advances under the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, (a) in the case of any U.S. dollar advances, (i) 1.50 per annum (or, at any time the Rating Condition is satisfied, 1.35 per annum) plus an alternate base rate (as described in the Revolving Credit Agreement) or (ii) 2.50 per annum (or, at any time the Rating Condition is satisfied, 2.35 per annum) plus Term SOFR, (b) in the case of any foreign currency advances (other than Pounds Sterling), 2.50 per annum (or, at any time the Rating Condition is satisfied, 2.35 per annum) plus the applicable benchmark rate and (c) in the case of any Pounds Sterling advances, 2.50 per annum (or, at any time the Rating Condition is satisfied, 2.35 per annum) plus the Daily Simple Risk Free Rate, in each case, depending on the nature of the advances being requested under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Rating Condition shall be satisfied at any time we maintain a public credit rating of at least BBB- from S P Global Ratings (or equivalent rating from Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch, Inc.). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at a weighted average interest rate of 7.8 and 7.9 , respectively. 
 Advances under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements, pursuant to which the amount of funds advanced varies depending upon the types of assets in our portfolio. Assets must meet certain criteria in order to be included in the borrowing base, and the borrowing base is subject to certain portfolio restrictions including investment size, sector concentrations and investment type. 
 Our ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which permits us to borrow up to 72.5 of the fair market value of its portfolio company investments depending on the type of investment we hold and whether the investment is quoted. Our ability to borrow is also subject to certain concentration limits, and continued compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants given by us under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including, but not limited to, our maintenance of: (1) minimum consolidated total net assets of the greater of (a) 500.0 million and (b) an amount equal to the sum of (i) 660.9 million plus (ii) an amount equal to 65 of the difference of (x) the net proceeds to us from sales of our equity securities during each quarter following October 20, 2023 and (y) the amount paid or distributed to purchase or redeem our common stock in connection with a tender offer during such quarter; (2) a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness of not less than 1.5 to 1; (3) a senior debt coverage ratio of at least 2 to 1; and (4) minimum net worth equal to or greater than 215.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires us to undertake customary indemnification obligations with respect to ING Capital LLC and other members of the lending group and to reimburse the lenders for expenses associated with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility also has customary provisions regarding events of default, including events of default for nonpayment, change in control transactions, failure to comply with financial and negative covenants, and failure to maintain our relationship with MC Advisors. If we incur an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility and fail to remedy such default under any applicable grace period, if any, then the entire Revolving Credit Facility could become immediately due and payable, which would materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility also imposes certain conditions that may limit the amount of our distributions to stockholders. Distributions payable in our common stock under the DRIP are not limited by the Revolving Credit Facility. Distributions in cash or property other than common stock are generally limited to 115 of the amount of distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors (primarily the Taxable Subsidiaries). Proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, making distributions, contributions and investments and such other uses as permitted under the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 The period during which we may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility expires on October 20, 2027, and the Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder must be repaid by October 20, 2028. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by us and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.

 SPV III Credit Facility 
 On March 28, 2024, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "SPV III Credit Facility") with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent, through a special purpose wholly-owned subsidiary, SPV III. The SPV III Credit Facility allows SPV III to borrow an aggregate principal amount of 100.0 million, and includes an accordion feature which allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the total size of the facility to 250.0 million upon request to the administrative agent and with consent of the lenders.

 Short-Term Borrowings 
 To finance the purchase of certain investments, we may enter into participation agreements for par/near par trades with a third-party counterparty, whereby we simultaneously agree to sell an investment and re-purchase the same investment back at a premium within a specified period of time, generally not to exceed 60-days from the date it was sold (each such transaction a Short-Term Borrowing ). The amount, interest rate and terms of these Short-Term Borrowings are negotiated on a transaction-by transaction basis. Each transaction is secured by an interest in an underlying asset which is participated or assigned to the counterparty for the duration of the transaction. 
 We account for our Short-Term Borrowings as a type of secured borrowing under ASC Topic 860 Transfers and Servicing and continue to present the participated investment as an asset and the obligation to repurchase the investment as a liability within debt on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Interest income earned on investments participated under the Short-Term Borrowings and financing charges associated with the Short-Term Borrowings are included within interest income and interest and other debt financing expenses, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest receivable on investments and accrued financing charges on the Short-Term Borrowings are included within interest and dividend receivable and interest payable, respectively, on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
 As of both of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding Short-Term Borrowings. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 We have an Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our investing activities. We pay MC Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fee for additional information. 
 We have an Administration Agreement with MC Management to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Commitments: As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments under undrawn revolvers, delayed draw commitments and subscription agreements totaling 745.0 million and 358.8 million, respectively. We believe that our available cash balances and/or ability to draw on existing credit facilities or raise additional leverage facilities provide sufficient funds to cover our unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we have entered into certain contracts with other parties that contain a variety of indemnification provisions. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, as of September 30, 2024, we have not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and believe the risk of loss related to such indemnification provisions to be remote. 
 Contingencies : As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a contingent liability related to a Level 1 equity investment, identified on the consolidated schedule of investments, that has a contingency in which a portion of the shares held by us would need to be returned. The contingent liability was initially recorded at an amortized cost of 0.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, the contingent liability is recorded at a fair value of 0.7 million and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on the contingent liability of 0.1 million which is included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions on the consolidated statements of operations. Please refer to the footnotes to the schedule of investments as of September 30, 2024 for additional information. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 
 
 Market Trends 
 We have identified the following general trends that may affect our business: 
 Target Market: We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between 10.0 million and 2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us. 
 Specialized Lending Requirements: We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. 
 Demand for Debt Capital : We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us. 
 Competition from Other Lenders: We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there has been a significant amount of capital raised over the past several years dedicated to middle market lending which has increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt which in turn could result in lower yields and weaker financial covenants for new assets. 
 129 

Table of Contents 

 Pricing and Deal Structures : We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues including changes in bank regulations for middle-market banks has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Sizable recent capital raises in the private debt marketplace have created significantly increased competition over the last few years, reducing available pricing and creating less favorable capital structures; however, we believe that current market conditions for our target market may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Market Environment: We believe middle market investments are attractive in the uncertain market environments such as the current market environment where inflationary pressure and interest rates remain elevated. Directly originated middle market loans have demonstrated the ability to outperform competing markets through varying economic cycles including downturns and prior periods of monetary policy tightening. Through the global financial crisis, the higher interest rate environment in 2005-2006, market bottom in 2008 and the subsequent recovery period, as well as throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, these investments have historically generated considerable yield premium with more favorable capital structures for lenders, resulting in higher returns when compared to the market for U.S. high yield bonds and U.S. traded loans. (1) Middle market direct lending also offers a natural hedge to higher interest rates with floating rate structures that benefit from higher interest rates, while providing broad diversification in an environment where there is a risk of increased default rate activity. We believe that direct lending volumes will continue outpacing syndicated loan transaction volumes due to capital requirements and liquidity constraints faced by banks. From late 2022 and throughout 2023, the middle market saw a consistent trend toward lower leverage and loan-to-value structures coupled with increased spreads. However, as M A activity has shown signs of a rebound in the first half of 2024, leverage and loan-to-value attachment points have stabilized while spreads have compressed in certain pockets of the market. (2) That said, we note that a softening macroeconomic environment and elevated interest rates could result in increased default rates. If default rates become more prevalent, we would expect to experience decreased net interest income, lower yields and increased risk of credit loss. However, we believe that Monroe Capital s scale, product suite, diversification, and strong historical recovery rate track record will continue to allow us to find attractive investment opportunities and navigate this uncertain market environment while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns.

 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and then we amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income over the life of the investment. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recorded as other income in the period the service is completed.

 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from LLC and LP investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 For periods prior to September 30, 2022, the Board determined the fair value of our investments in good faith on a quarterly basis. On September 30, 2022, pursuant to SEC Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board designated MC Advisors as our valuation designee (the Valuation Designee ). The Board is responsible for oversight of the Valuation Designee. The Valuation Designee has established a valuation committee to determine in good faith the fair value of our investments, based on input of the Valuation Designee s management and personnel and independent valuation firms which are engaged at the direction of the valuation committee to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments lacking a readily available market quotation. The valuation committee determines fair values pursuant to a valuation policy approved by the Board and pursuant to a consistently applied valuation process. 
 Under the valuation policy, the Valuation Designee values investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. When doing so, the Valuation Designee determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available or whose market prices are not regularly updated are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Valuation Designee using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Valuation Designee undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of the Valuation Designee responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; 
 our Valuation Designee engages an independent valuation firm to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of investments for which market quotations are not readily available. We will consult with an independent valuation firm relative to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year, but the independent appraisals are generally received quarterly for each investment; 
 to the extent an independent valuation firm is not engaged to conduct an investment appraisal on an investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the investment will be valued by the Valuation Designee; 
 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the valuation committee of the Valuation Designee; 
 the valuation conclusions are approved by the valuation committee of the Valuation Designee; and 
 a report prepared by the Valuation Designee is presented to the Board quarterly to allow the Board to perform its oversight duties of the valuation process and the Valuation Designee.

Table of Contents 

 The Valuation Designee generally uses the income approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, the Valuation Designee may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. This liquidation analysis may also include probability weighting of alternative outcomes. The Valuation Designee generally considers our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner, the loan is in covenant compliance and the loan is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, the Valuation Designee considers fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, the Valuation Designee will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the debt instrument. 
 Under the income approach, discounted cash flow models are utilized to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the income approach, the Valuation Designee also considers the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, recent transactions, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made. 
 Under the market approach, the enterprise value methodology is typically utilized to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which the Valuation Designee derives a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the Valuation Designee analyzes various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. 
 In addition, for certain investments, the Valuation Designee may base its valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. The Valuation Designee generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Valuation Designee determined, in good faith, the fair value of our investment portfolio in accordance with GAAP and our valuation procedures based on the facts and circumstances known by us at that time, or reasonably expected to be known at that time. 
 Net Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss 
 We measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gain or loss previously recognized. Net change in unrealized gain or loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gain or loss is realized. Additionally, we do not isolate the change in fair value resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from the changes in the fair values of the underlying investment. All fluctuations in fair value are included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on our consolidated statements of operations. The impact resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings is included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency and other transactions.

 Capital Gains Incentive Fee 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals 12.5 (reduced from 15.0 as a result of MC Advisors April 18, 2022 agreement to permanently waive a portion of the incentive fees starting on January 1, 2022) of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period. 
 While the Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of 0.7 million and 1.6 million, respectively, based on the performance of our portfolio. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 31 thousand and 71 thousand, respectively, was payable to MC Advisors as a result of realized gains. The remainder was based on unrealized appreciation, none of which was payable to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reversed 0.1 million of previously accrued capital gains incentive fees based on the performance of our portfolio. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform ASU 2020-04 ). The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. We did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) ASU 2022-03 ), which affects all entities that have investments in equity securities measured at fair value that are subject to a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring the fair value. The amendments also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-03 on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) ASU 2023-07 ), which enhances disclosure requirements about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (the CODM ). ASU 2023-07, among other things, (i) requires a single segment public entity to provide all of the disclosures as required by Topic 280, (ii) requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources and (iii) provides the ability for a public entity to elect more than one performance measure. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and retrospective adoption is required for all prior periods presented. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance, however, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 

 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 , Income Taxes (Topic 740) ASU 2023-09 ), which updates income tax disclosure requirements related to rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and other disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and is to be adopted on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and inflation and supply chain risk. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies we invest in; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability, including related to the elevated inflation; and interest rate fluctuations. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments may not have readily available market quotations (as such term is defined in Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act), and those investments which do not have readily available market quotations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Valuation Designee in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. 
 In accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, our Board periodically assesses and manages material risks associated with the determination of the fair value of our investments. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The majority of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates and we expect that our loans in the future may also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on a floating SOFR and typically have interest rate re-set provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a monthly or quarterly basis. The majority of the loans in our current portfolio have interest rate floors that will effectively convert the loans to fixed rate loans in the event interest rates decrease. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility, SPV Credit Facility, SPV II Credit Facility, SPV III Credit Facility, SPV IV Credit Facility and 2023 Class A Notes have a floating interest rate provision, whereas our 2022 Secured Notes, 2023 Class B Notes, 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes have fixed interest rates until maturity. We expect that other credit facilities into which we may enter in the future may also have floating interest rate provisions. 
 Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (in thousands): 
 Change in Interest Rates Increase (decrease) in interest income Increase (decrease) in interest expense Net increase (decrease) in net investment income Down 300 basis points (99,283) (34,523) (64,760) Down 200 basis points (66,955) (23,015) (43,940) Down 100 basis points (33,704) (11,508) (22,196) Up 100 basis points 34,240 11,508 22,732 Up 200 basis points 68,480 23,015 45,465 Up 300 basis points 102,719 34,523 68,196 
 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, SPV Credit Facility, SPV II Credit Facility, SPV III Credit Facility, SPV IV Credit Facility, 2023 Class A Notes or other borrowings that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.

Table of Contents 

 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates or interest rate floors. 
 Currency Risk 
 We may also have exposure to foreign currencies (currently Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Great Britain pounds) related to certain investments and Australian dollars and Great Britain pounds borrowings through the Revolving Credit Facility. Such investments are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. In order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates, we may borrow in foreign currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to finance such investments or we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts. As of September 30, 2024, we had foreign currency forward contracts in place for CAD 29.3 million, AUD 57.8 million and GBP 3.2 million associated with future principal and interest payments on certain investments. 
 Inflation and Supply Chain Risk 
 Economic activity has continued to accelerate across sectors and regions. Nevertheless, due to global supply chain issues, geopolitical events, a rise in energy prices and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen, inflation is showing signs of acceleration in the U.S. and globally. Inflation is likely to continue in the near to medium-term, particularly in the U.S., with the possibility that monetary policy may tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies profit margins. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, at the end of the period covered by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject to certain legal proceedings, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, we, our executive officers, directors and our investment adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in our portfolio companies and may, as a result, incur significant costs and expenses in connection with such litigation. We and our investment adviser are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings or investigations against us or our investment adviser, respectively. While the outcome of any such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, neither us nor our investment adviser expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 You should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including our interim financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to purchase our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, you may lose all or part of your investment. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes known to us during the period ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors discussed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Structure 
 Political and regulatory conditions that contribute to uncertainty and market volatility including the impact of the upcoming U.S. presidential election and legislative, regulatory, trade and policy changes associated with a new administration could materially impact our business operations and financial performance and business and financial performance of our portfolio companies. 
 
 The political and economic environment in the U.S. has resulted in and will continue to result in some uncertainty. Changing regulatory policies because of the changing political environment could impact our regulatory and compliance costs and future revenues, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure to adapt to or comply with evolving regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners and access to capital. Further, a change in the U.S. presidential administration and congressional seat turnover following the 2024 election cycle may result in increased regulatory and economic uncertainty. Changes in federal policy by the executive branch and regulatory agencies may occur over time through the new presidential administration s and/or Congress s policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on our industry; however, the nature, timing and economic and political effects of such potential changes remain highly uncertain. Any future changes in federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations, could affect us and our portfolio companies in substantial and unpredictable ways. At this time, it is unclear what laws, regulations and policies may change and whether future changes or uncertainty surrounding future changes will adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our business, the business of our portfolio companies, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Investments 
 We may be subject to risks associated with investments in credit return swaps and other derivatives products. 
 On a limited basis, we may purchase and sell credit derivative contracts, including credit default swaps. Generally, credit default swaps carry a number of risks, including but not limited to, high levels of leverage, wide bid/offer spreads and documentation risks. 
 138 

Table of Contents 

 In addition to general market risks, credit default swaps are subject to leverage risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Our use of credit default swaps may result in losses due to adverse market movements. It is also subject to leverage risk which means that small changes in the value of the underlying assets or instruments may produce disproportionate losses to us. Any such credit default swaps of us are expected to be illiquid and not to trade. In addition, there can be no assurance that the counterparty to a credit default swap will be able to fulfill its obligations to us if a credit event occurs. The market for credit default swaps is relatively illiquid, and there are considerable risks that may make it difficult either to buy or sell the contracts as needed or to do so at reasonable prices. Liquidity risk also includes risks arising from margin requirements, which include the risk that we will be required to pay additional margin or set aside additional collateral to maintain open credit default swap positions. The size and relative immaturity of the credit default swap market may expose us to large and unexpected risks. During periods of economic stress the credit default swaps market may not function as expected and may experience disruption, illiquidity, counterparty default, extreme volatility or imperfect price discovery. 
 Additionally, standard credit derivative swap contracts generally do not prohibit swap counterparties from transacting with the underlying reference entity or in any underlying reference obligations. As a result, there is a risk that our investment in a credit default swap may be materially and adversely affected by the actions taken by our counterparty to the swap, the reference entity, the controlling person of such reference entity or any other person who has an economic incentive that differs from those of us, whether or not such actions are intended to directly or indirectly affect the value of the credit default swap itself. 
 The financial stability and creditworthiness of the buyer play a crucial role in determining the ultimate effectiveness of the credit default protection. As such, we would be exposed to both the borrower s and counterparty s credit risk. This risk increases if our credit default swap transactions are concentrated with one or few counterparties. Although we intend to only enter into credit default swap transactions with banks, brokers and other creditworthy financial institutions, there can be no guarantee such counterparties will honor their obligations to us. 
 The use of credit default swaps is also subject to operational risk which generally refers to risks related to potential operational issues, including documentation issues, settlement issues, system failures, inadequate controls, and human error, as well as legal risk which refers to risks of loss resulting from insufficient documentation or legality or enforceability of a contract. In addition, there may be disputes between the buyer and the seller of a credit default swap agreement or within the swaps market as a whole as to whether a credit event has occurred or what the payment should be. Such disputes could result in litigation or other delays, and the outcome could be adverse for the buyer or the seller. 
 Credit default swaps are a relatively recent development in the financial markets. Consequently, there are certain legal, tax and market uncertainties that present risks in entering into credit default swaps. There is currently little or no case law or litigation characterizing credit default swaps, interpreting their provisions or characterizing their tax treatment. Moreover, additional regulations and laws may apply to credit default swaps that have not heretofore been applied. There can be no assurance that future decisions construing similar provisions to those in any credit default swap or other related documents or additional regulations and laws will not have a material adverse effect on us. 
 It should be noted that the structure and operation of credit default swaps may differ between jurisdictions. To the extent such differences exist, the risks associated with credit default swaps may also differ. 
 139 

Table of Contents 

 On a limited basis, we may also utilize customized derivative instruments, such as a total return swaps TRS ), to receive synthetically the economic attributes associated with an investment in a security or financial instrument or a basket of securities or financial instruments. TRS allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying instrument without actually owning the instrument. Just like other derivative instruments, TRS are subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit quality and expected recovery rates of the underlying credit instrument as well as renewal risks. TRS are also subject to leverage risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and legal risk as described above. There may be circumstances in which MC Advisors would conclude that the best or only means by which we could make a desirable investment is through the use of such derivative structures. We may be exposed to certain risks should MC Advisors use derivatives as a means to implement synthetically its investment strategies. If we enter into a derivative instrument whereby it agrees to receive the economic return of an individual security or financial instrument or a basket of securities or financial instruments, it will typically contract to receive such returns for a predetermined period of time. During such period, we may not have the ability to increase or decrease its exposure. In addition, such customized derivative instruments are expected to be highly illiquid and it is possible that we will not be able to terminate such derivative instruments prior to their expiration date or that the penalties associated with such a termination might impact our performance in a materially adverse manner. Finally, certain aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such customized derivative instruments are uncertain and, if the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such instruments is successfully challenged by the IRS, a Limited Partner s after-tax return from its investment may be adversely affected. 
 We may be subject to risk associated with margin calls in connection with our credit default swaps or other derivatives transactions. 
 We may be subject to margin calls in connection with its credit default swap and other derivative transactions that are subject to initial and/or variation margin requirements. The dynamic nature of the margin models utilized in such transactions and the fact that the margin models might be changed at any time could subject us to an unexpected increase in collateral obligations to counterparties during a volatile market environment, which could have a detrimental effect on us. Further, the credit default swap initial and/or variation margin models may use other securities or assets other than the reference obligation to determine margin requirements. Accordingly, we may be required to post most more margin than it otherwise would have if the margin was determined solely by the value of the reference obligation. 
 140 

Table of Contents 

 We may be subject to risks associated with the value of the collateral involved in our derivatives transactions. 
 To the extent we sell credit default swaps, we may mitigate its credit default swap risk by requiring credit default swap buyers to deliver a loan or other instrument with a first lien on the reference borrower s collateral in the event of a credit event. However, the value of the collateral subject to the lien may be subject to fluctuations due to market conditions, economic factors, or other unforeseen events. In cases where we do not have continuous access to updated collateral valuations, there is a risk that the collateral may not adequately cover our obligations in the event of default. There are also risks that operational or administrative challenges may hinder our ability to access and manage the collateral effectively in the event of a credit event. These challenges could include issues related to the proper documentation, recording, and safekeeping of collateral assets. The market liquidity of certain types of collateral may also affect our ability to quickly convert the collateral into cash. Illiquid markets can lead to delays in the liquidation process, potentially resulting in increased exposure to losses. 
 Further, changes in legal or regulatory frameworks governing collateral rights may impact our ability to enforce and realize the value of the collateral in case of borrower default. Adverse legal developments could lead to delays or restrictions in the foreclosure process, which may adversely impact us. Additionally, we face the risk of undiscovered or undisclosed liabilities associated with the collateral. In some cases, the borrower may not fully disclose encumbrances, legal claims, or other issues that could affect the value or availability of the collateral any of which would adversely impact us. Furthermore, in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the borrower, our claim on the collateral may be subject to competing claims from other creditors. The priority of claims and the legal framework governing the distribution of assets can impact our recovery rate. Moreover, we may have fewer rights in connection with the first lien it receives upon the occurrence of a credit event than if it made a loan to a defaulting borrower directly, which may adversely impact our ability to recover. 
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") rules may have a negative impact on us and MC Advisors. 
 The CFTC and the SEC have issued rules establishing that certain swap transactions are subject to CFTC regulation. Engaging in such swap or other commodity interest transactions such as futures contracts or options on futures contracts may cause us to fall within the definition of commodity pool under the Commodity Exchange Act and related CFTC regulations. MC Advisors has claimed relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100 of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5.

 Our ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and financial commitment transactions may be limited. 
 Under SEC Rule 18f-4, related to the use of derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements and certain other transactions by registered investment companies, we are permitted to enter into derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations, including short sales, notwithstanding the senior security provisions of the 1940 Act if we comply with certain value-at-risk leverage limits and derivatives risk management program and board oversight and reporting requirements or comply with a limited derivatives users exception. Rule 18f-4 also permits us to enter into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions notwithstanding the senior security provisions of the 1940 Act if we aggregate the amount of indebtedness associated with our reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions with the aggregate amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness when calculating our asset coverage ratios as discussed above. In addition, we are permitted to invest in a security on a when-issued or forward-settling basis, or with a non-standard settlement cycle, and the transaction will be deemed not to involve a senior security under the 1940 Act, provided that (i) we intend to physically settle the transaction and (ii) the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision ). We may otherwise engage in such transactions that do not meet the conditions of the Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision so long as we treat any such transaction as a derivatives transaction for purposes of compliance with the rule. Furthermore, we are permitted to enter into an unfunded commitment agreement, and such unfunded commitment agreement will not be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, if we reasonably believe, at the time we enter into such agreement, that we will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet our obligations with respect to all such agreements as they come due. 
 Future legislation or rules may modify how we treat derivatives and other financial arrangements for purposes of our compliance with the leverage limitations of the 1940 Act. Future legislation or rules may modify how leverage is calculated under the 1940 Act and, therefore, may increase or decrease the amount of leverage currently available to us under the 1940 Act, which may be materially adverse to us and our stockholders. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On August 16, 2024, we issued 15,732,189 shares of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share, at a price of 10.34 per share for proceeds of 162.7 million. 
 The sale of shares of our common stock was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by us, on the one hand, and each of our investors, on the other hand. The issuance and sale of the shares of our common stock are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Regulation D or Regulation S thereunder, as applicable. 
 Except as previously reported by us in this Item 2 or on our current reports on Form 8-K, we did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
