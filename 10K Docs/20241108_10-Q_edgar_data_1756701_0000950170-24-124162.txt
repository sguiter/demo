 ASU 2017-04 on . The adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the Company's operating results or financial condition. Derivatives On March 28, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging Portfolio Layer Method. The purpose of this updated guidance is to further align risk management objectives with hedge accounting results on the application of the last-of-layer method, which was first introduced in ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2022-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption in the interim period permitted. For entities who have already adopted ASU 2017-12, immediate adoption is allowed. ASU 2022-01 requires a modified retrospective transition method for basis adjustments in which the entity will recognize the cumulative effect of the change on the opening balance of each affected component of equity in the statement of financial position as of the date of adoption. The Company ASU 2022-01 on . The adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the Company's operating results or financial condition. Current Expected Credit Losses On , the Company ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended, which replaces the impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. This model is also applicable to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance, such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2016-03 require credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be presented as a valuation allowance rather than as a direct write down. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. At January 1, 2023, the Company increased the allowance for credit losses for loans by million, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments by thousand, and the allowance on held-to-maturity securities by thousand. At January 1, 2023, the Company reported a cumulative-effect adjustment of million which decreased retained earnings.

LINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) [In Thousands, Except Share Data] 

 thousand to the allowance for credit losses. The remaining noncredit discount (based on the adjusted amortized cost basis) will be accreted into interest income at the effective interest rate as of January 1, 2023. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted a rule that provides a banking organization the option to phase-in, over a three year period, the effects of CECL on its regulatory capital upon the adoption of the CECL standard. The Company has elected to exercise this phase-in option. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13 and its related amendments. The amendments require that an entity evaluate whether the loan modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, and introduce new requirements related to modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments also require public business entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. For entities that have adopted ASU 2016-13, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. For entities that have not adopted ASU 2016-13, the amendments in this update are effective at the time the entity adopts ASU 2016-13. The Company this standard effective in conjunction with ASC 326. The adoption of this standard did t have a material effect on the Company's operating results or financial condition. 

the Company completed its merger with Partners. Pursuant to the Partners Merger Agreement, Partners merged with and into LINKBANCORP with LINKBANCORP as the surviving corporation. Additionally, the Bank of Delmarva and Virginia Partners Bank each merged with and into LINKBANK, with LINKBANK as the surviving bank. The Partners Merger constituted a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 805 Business Combinations. As such, LINKBANCORP was the accounting acquirer and Partners was the accounting acquiree and the historical financial statements of the combined company are the historical financial statements of LINKBANCORP.

Goodwill From the Merger 

(1) The Company recorded a million measurement period adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill related to a PCD loan at June 30, 2024 

Pursuant to accounting standards, the Company assigned a fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Partners. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Partners were recorded at their estimated fair values based on management s best estimates using information available at the date of the acquisition and are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition. While the fair values are not expected to be materially different from the estimates, any material adjustments to the estimates will be reflected, retroactively, as of the date of the acquisition. The items most susceptible to adjustment are the fair value adjustments on loans, core deposit intangible and the deferred income tax assets resulting from the acquisition. The Company is continuing to finalize the fair values of all aspects of the acquisition. During the second quarter of 2024, management identified a loan which, at the time of acquisition, met the criteria to be considered purchase credit deteriorated. The 

 13 

LINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) [In Thousands, Except Share Data] 

 added to the allowance for credit losses, and added to goodwill. The resulting changes to loans, goodwill, and deferred taxes are reflected within this footnote. Goodwill represents consideration transferred in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition represents the value expected from the expansion of the Company's market and enhancement of operations and efficiencies. Goodwill acquired in the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. Investment securities available-for-sale The estimated fair values of the investment securities available for sale, primarily comprised of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and obligations of U.S. Government agencies and corporations were determined using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. A fair value discount of was recorded and will be amortized over the estimated life of the investments using the interest rate method. Loans Acquired loans are classified into two categories: PCD loans and non-PCD loans. PCD loans are defined as a loan or group of loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCD loans will have an allowance established on acquisition date, which is recognized as an expense through provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans of million was recorded through the provision for credit losses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For PCD loans, an allowance is recognized at acquisition by adding it to the fair value of the loan, which is the Day 1 amortized cost . There is no provision for credit loss expense recognized on PCD loans because the initial allowance is established by grossing-up the amortized cost of the PCD loan. At the date of acquisition, of the billion of loans acquired from Partners, million, or , of Partners loan portfolio, was accounted for as PCD loans. The fair value of PCD loans was million at the date of acquisition. The gross contractual amounts receivable related to the PCD loans was million. The Company estimates, on the date of acquisition, that of the contractual cash flows specific to the PCD loans will not be collected. Leased Facilities The Company assumed leases on facilities of Partners. The Company believes that the current lease costs were at market terms therefore no fair value adjustment is needed. Owned Facilities The Company acquired locations previously owned by Partners as branches and administration offices. A fair value adjustment of million was recorded at acquisition date. Core Deposit Intangible The fair value of the core deposit intangible was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate commensurate with market participants. To calculate cash flows, deposit account servicing costs (net of deposit fee income) and interest expense on deposits were compared to the higher cost of alternative funding sources available through national brokered CD offering rates and FHLB advance rates. The projected cash flows were developed using expected deposit attrition. The core deposit intangible will be amortized over ten years using the sum-of-years digits method. Time Deposits The fair value adjustment for time deposits was based on a discounted cash flow methodology of the contract rates and contractual repayments of fixed maturity deposits using prevailing market interest rates for similar-term time deposits. The time deposit fair value adjustment will be amortized into income on a level yield amortization method over the contractual life of the deposits. Long Term Borrowings The Company reviewed the cost of the borrowings to market interest rates for similar instruments and believed that the rates were comparable and that fair value adjustment was recorded. Subordinated Debt The fair value of the subordinated debt was determined using a discounted cash flow method using a market participant discount rate for similar instruments. The subordinated debt fair value adjustment will be amortized into income on a level yield amortization method based upon the assumed market rate and the term of the subordinated debt.

Credit Quality Information The following tables represent credit exposures by internally assigned grades as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or at all. The Company s internally assigned grades are as follows: Pass loans that are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying collateral. There are four sub-grades within the Pass category to further distinguish the loan. Special Mention loans where a potential weakness or risk exists, which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected. Substandard loans that have a well-defined weakness based on objective evidence and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a Substandard asset. In addition, these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on existing circumstances. Loss loans classified as a Loss are considered uncollectible and are immediately charged against allowances.

Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value. These securities are valued by an independent third party. The valuations are based on market data. The valuations utilize evaluated pricing models that vary by asset and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. For securities that do not trade on a daily basis, their evaluated pricing applications apply available information such as benchmarking and matrix pricing. The market inputs normally sought in the evaluation of securities include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes (only obtained from market makers or broker/dealers recognized as market participants), issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bid, offers and reference data. For certain securities additional inputs may be used or some market inputs may not be applicable. Inputs are prioritized differently on any given day based on market conditions.

Stock options are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options have certain tax advantages and must comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The 2019 Plan was frozen such that new awards would be granted under the 2019 Plan following receipt of shareholder approval of the LINKBANCORP, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan described within this footnote. On May 26, 2022, the Company's shareholders approved the LINKBANCORP, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2022 Plan").

The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued a rule pursuant to The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 to establish for institutions with assets of less than billion a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of that qualifying institutions may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. If an election to use the community bank leverage ratio capital framework is made, a qualifying bank with less than billion in assets with capital exceeding the specified community bank leverage ratio is considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the requirement to be well capitalized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had not elected to be subject to the alternative framework. Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by the Bank. The Pennsylvania Banking Code provides that cash dividends may be declared and paid out of accumulated net earnings. In addition, dividends paid by the Bank would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. Loans or advances by the Bank to the Company are limited to percent of the Bank s capital stock and surplus and must have collateral securing the loans or advances.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment.

which has a fixed rate of , a maturity of and is designated against either a mix of one-month FHLB advances or brokered certificates of deposit. The Company will utilize, from time to time, interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. At September 30, 2024, the derivative contract is used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with monthly brokered deposits. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of inte94rest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. The amounts reclassified to interest expense were thousand and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Comparatively, the amounts reclassified to interest expense for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were thousand and thousand, respectively. Over the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional thousand will be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense. The Company recorded thousand and thousand within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which represented the fair value of this derivative at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

 Overview and Strategy 
 The Company s core strategy is to further its mission of positively impacting lives through community banking by building strong relationships that bring value to its customers, employees, the communities it serves and its shareholders. In pursuing this mission, the Company specifically desires to invest in the development of strong future leaders for the banking industry and our communities, to contribute to economically and socially flourishing communities, and to demonstrate the continued viability and integral role of community banking for our economic and social development. 
 The Company operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, LINKBANK, which provides traditional lending, deposit gathering and cash services to retail customers, small businesses and nonprofit organizations. The Bank focuses its lending activities on small businesses, targeted to create a diverse loan portfolio in relation to its underlying collateral and different business segments with unique cash flow generation and varied interest rate sensitivity. The Bank offers a full suite of deposit products and cash management services focused on the small business and nonprofit segments. 
 Our revenues consist primarily of interest income earned on loans and investments. Interest income is partially offset by interest expense incurred on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their relative interest rates. Net interest income is typically further reduced by a provision for credit losses. 
 Non-interest income also contributes to our operating results, consisting of service charges on deposit accounts, earnings on bank-owned life insurance, revenue from the sale of securities, and revenue from the sale of SBA loans and residential mortgage loans to the secondary market and related servicing fees. Non-interest expenses, which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional fees, FDIC insurance expense, merger and system conversion expense, and other general and administrative expenses, are the Company s primary expenditures incurred as a result of operations. 
 Financial institutions, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are concentrated in South Central Pennsylvania in Dauphin, Chester, Cumberland, Lancaster, Northumberland, Schuylkill, and York Counties. In 2023 as a result of the completion of the Partners Merger, we entered the counties of Wicomico, Charles, Anne Arundel, and Worcester counties in Maryland, Sussex county in Delaware, Camden and Burlington counties in New Jersey, Spotsylvania county in Virginia, and the cities of Fredericksburg and Reston, Virginia. Our operations and lending are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company. 
 Pending Sale of New Jersey Solutions Centers 
 On May 9, 2024, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (the Agreement with American Heritage Federal Credit Union AHFCU pursuant to which AHFCU will purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities (the Transaction of the New Jersey operations of the Bank, including all three branch locations (including two branch leases). 
 45 

Under the Agreement, AHFCU will acquire substantially all of the loans, three branch locations (along with associated personal property and fixtures) and will assume substantially all of the deposits. The total deposit premium to be paid by AHFCU equates to approximately 7.0 of all deposits assumed at closing. With respect to the acquired loans, AHFCU will pay an amount equal to the principal balances plus any accrued but unpaid interest and late charges on the loans measured as of the closing date. AHFCU will pay book value for fixed assets, real estate and any other assets located at the owned branch. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 102.3 million in loans and 94.0 million in deposits were classified as held for sale in connection with the Transaction. 
 The Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. 
 
 Partners Merger 
 On November 30, 2023, LINKBANCORP completed its merger with Partners Bancorp ("Partners"), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Bank of Delmarva and Virginia Partners Bank, pursuant to which Partners merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation (the "Partners Merger"). The Bank of Delmarva and Virginia Partners Bank merged with and into LINKBANK with LINKBANK as the surviving bank. In connection with the announcement of the Partners Merger in the first quarter of 2023, LINKBANCORP completed a private placement of 10.0 million with certain directors of LINKBANCORP as well as other accredited investors. 
 
 Financial Highlights

 Quarterly Net Income and Net Income Per Share - Net income was 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 5.8 million increase from the same period in 2023 and a 1.3 million increase from the three months ended June 30, 2024 ("Linked Quarter"). Diluted earnings per share was 0.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.08 per diluted share for the comparable period in 2023. 

YTD Net Income - Net income was 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 17.6 million increase from the same period in 2023. 

Net Interest Income - Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased 16.6 million or 199.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.82 , representing a 93 basis points increase over the same period in 2023. Compared to the Linked Quarter, net interest income before provision for credit losses increased 497 thousand and net interest margin decreased 1 basis point. 

See the sections below for a complete analysis of the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Total assets at September 30, 2024, were 2.88 billion, an increase of 210.6 million, or 7.9 , from 2.67 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 111.0 million, from 80.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 191.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase in loans held for investment of 87.6 million, from 2.13 billion at December 31, 2023 to 2.22 billion at September 30, 2024, and an increase in securities available-for-sale from 115.5 million at December 31, 2023 to 149.3 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased 111.0 million, or 138.5 , from 80.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 191.2 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to: 
 Primary Cash Inflows 
 Net increase in deposits of 166.2 million; 

Proceeds from long-term borrowings of 40.0 million; 

Net cash from investment securities (sales, calls, maturities, and principal repayments) of 21.1 million; and 

Cash from operating activities of 19.6 million. 

Primary Cash Outflows 
 Net increase in cash funding of loans receivable of 65.1 million; 

Purchase of investment securities available for sale of 50.4 million; 

46 

Repayment of short-term borrowings of 10.0 million; and 

Dividends paid of 8.3 million. 

Securities available-for-sale increased by 33.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with a balance of 149.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 115.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to purchases of investment securities of 50.4 million and an increase in the fair value of our securities of 2.1 million as a result of changes in market conditions. The increase was partially offset by sales/calls/repayments totaling 19.0 million. Securities held to maturity decreased 2.1 million, or 5.7 to 34.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 36.7 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of principal repayments of 2.1 million. 
 Net loans receivable increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as shown in the table below:

The above table does not include loans that are held for sale related to the New Jersey branch sale. 
 Commercial real estate loans increased 81.6 million during the first nine months of 2024. This growth was not attributable to any one significant relationship and was primarily the result of current balances of new loan originations of 122.3 million partially offset by net loan repayment activity. Construction loans increased 207 thousand during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to draws on existing loans of 36.7 million and new loan originations for the year to date of 20.2 million. Payoffs on construction loans existing at December 31, 2023 were 35.1 million and 26.0 million in construction loans were reclassified into other loan segments upon completion of construction . Commercial loans increased 2.7 million from December 31, 2023, resulting from 32.5 million in balances on newly originated loans offset by net loan repayments on existing loans. 
 The allowance for credit losses-loans increased 2.8 million from 23.8 million at December 31, 2023 to 26.5 million at September 30, 2024. The primary driver of the increased allowance for credit losses-loans was a measurement period adjustment resulting in a 2.3 million provision related to a non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan from the Partners Merger that experienced credit deterioration that existed at acquisition and was considered purchase-credit deteriorated. The recorded investment of this loan was 3.95 million at September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 At September 30, 2024, non-performing loans, which is defined as non-accrual loans, and loans delinquent greater than 90 days and still accruing interest, was 17.4 million or 0.78 of total gross loans held for investment. This compares to 7.3 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2023, which equated to 0.34 of total gross loans held for investment. The increase in non-accrual loans was due to the loan acquired in the Partners Merger described above, and an owner-occupied commercial real estate relationship totaling 6.5 million that experienced deterioration and was downgraded. This credit was placed on non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2024, at which time the Company obtained updated appraisals of the underlying collateral indicating that there was sufficient collateral value resulting in no required specific reserve as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, our allowance for credit losses for loans totaled 26.5 million at September 30, 2024 and represented 1.20 of our total gross loans held for investment, compared to 23.8 million or 1.06 of our total gross loans at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no other real estate owned. 
 47 

The federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land acquisitions which represent 100 or more of an institution s total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300 or more of the institution s total risk-based capital and the institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years, including through the recently completed Partners Merger. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represented 365.86 of total risk based capital compared to 374.5 at December 31, 2023. Construction, land and land development loans represented 63.31 of total risk based capital at September 30, 2024 compared to 64.46 at December 31, 2023. These percentages of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to total risk based capital, and construction loans to total risk based capital were calculated using total loans, including loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024, in accordance with prevailing regulatory guidance. Management has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures and prudent underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. Loan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis to evaluate changes to cash flows and changes in collateral values to determine the loan level of stress over key underwriting metrics such as debt service coverage ratios, and loan-to-value ratios. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company's Capital Policy and Capital Plan has established internal minimum targets for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no concentrations of loans in any one industry exceeding 10 of its total loan portfolio. An industry for this purpose is defined as a group of businesses that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. 
 Deposits grew by 173.9 million, or 7.9 , to 2.37 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.20 billion at December 31, 2023. Changes in the deposit types are presented in the table below:

New accounts opened during the first nine months of 2024 also explained the growth in money market and savings accounts, contributing 61.6 million to the overall balance growth of 15.8 million. 
 
 The Company has estimated deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of 250,000 of 844.0 million, or 34.22 of total deposits and 713.4 million, or 31.04 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total uninsured deposits is calculated based on regulatory reporting requirements and reflects the portion of any deposit of a customer at an insured depository institution that exceeds the applicable FDIC insurance coverage for that depositor at that institution and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regime. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total uninsured deposits includes 52.0 million and 41.2 million, 
 48 

respectively, of municipal deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limits. These municipal deposits are fully secured with pledged securities from our available for sale securities portfolio. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, long-term borrowings consisted of 40.0 million and 0, respectively, in long-term FHLB advances. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company replaced some of its overnight borrowings with a lower cost, 40.0 million term advance with a fixed interest rate of 4.827 , maturing in February 2026. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, short term FHLB advances were 0 and 10.0 million, respectively. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a pay fixed/received variable interest rate swap with a notional amount of 75 million which has a fixed rate of 3.28 , and a maturity of five years. As part of the transaction, the Company will receive an offset to the interest incurred on either a mix of one-month FHLB advances or brokered certificates of deposit at a rate equal to one-month SOFR. Our time deposits balance as of September 30, 2024 contains 75 million of one-month maturity brokered deposits that matured in October 2024. As part of our interest rate swap transaction, the Company has committed to maintain either one-month advances from the FHLB or brokered deposits with a duration of one month through May 2028. 
 Subordinated debt with a fair value of 20.7 million was assumed as part of the Gratz Merger. These notes bear interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.0 per year for five years and then float at an index tied to the SOFR. The notes have a term of ten years, with a maturity date of October 1, 2030. The notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, subject to any required regulatory approvals after five years, or October 1, 2025. Additionally, on April 8, 2022, LINKBANCORP issued subordinated debt with a carrying value of 20.0 million. These notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50 per year up to April 15, 2027 and then float to an index tied to the three-month SOFR, plus 203 basis points. Subject to limited exceptions, the Company cannot redeem the notes before the fifth anniversary of the issuance date. The balance of subordinated debt was 40.4 million and 40.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Subordinated notes with carrying value of 21.4 million were assumed in the Partners Merger within two tranches of debt issuances. The first tranche has a face value of 4.5 million and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.875 per year for four years. The second tranche has a face value of 18.05 million and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0 per year for 18 additional months. 
 Total shareholders equity increased by 11.6 million, or 4.4 , to 277.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 265.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to net income of 18.6 million for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was offset by dividends of 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a dissolution of a minority interest of 483 thousand. 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General: Net income was 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or 0.19 per diluted share, an increase of 5.9 million compared to net income of 1.2 million, or 0.08 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period was primarily the result of an increase in interest and dividend income of 25.4 million and an increase in non-interest income of 1.8 million. Offsetting the increase in net income was an increase in interest expense of 8.8 million, and an increase in non-interest expense of 10.5 million primarily as a result of the increase in salaries and employee benefits of 5.7 million due to the Partners Merger for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period. 
 Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between the interest the Company earns on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the expense the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates the Company earns or pays on them. In general, the shift in the interest rate environment that began in March of 2022 resulted in higher interest rates earned on loans, securities, and interest-earning cash as well as higher interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed money when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. Since December 31, 2021, the Federal Funds Target Rate rose from a range of 0.00 - 0.25 to a range of 5.25 - 5.50 as of September 30, 2023 which held until September 2024 and decreased to a range of 4.75 - 5.00 as of September 30, 2024. While this interest rate index is not used for all financial instruments, the interest rate indices and interest rate curves have increased over this same time horizon. The results of this overall upward shift in interest rates has generally caused net interest margins at financial institutions to contract when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023 as the cost of funds of financial institutions, generally, have risen at a faster pace than the yield on interest earning assets. While this trend is generally accurate across the broader banking sector, our results for the third quarter of 2024 have been positively impacted by the Partners Merger by adding increased yield on interest earning assets which outpaced the rise in funding costs when compared to the same period in 2023. As shown in the table below and subsequent discussion, 
 49 

the average yield on interest earning assets increased 103 basis points when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, while our average cost of funds increased seven basis points over that same period, resulting in an increase to net interest margin of 93 basis points. 
 Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields: The following table sets forth certain information relating to average balance sheets and reflects the average annualized yield on interest-earning assets and average annualized cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the periods indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for credit losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to yields. Yields on earning assets are shown on a fully taxable-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of 21 .

16,645 

Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by 16.6 million, or 199.1 , to 25.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase can be mostly attributed to higher average balances in loans as well as a 103 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from increased average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to the higher interest rate environment and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities. The increase in average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was a result of the completion of the Partners Merger. The net interest margin increased 93 basis points to 3.82 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Income: Interest income increased to 40.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans as a result of the growth in average loans as well as the increase in average yields earned on all categories of interest earning assets. The growth in the average balance of interest earning assets which increased 1.5 billion to 2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 billion for the comparable period in 2023 contributed 19.1 million to the increase in interest income. The growth in the average balance of interest earning assets was due primarily to the increase in the average balance of loans which increased 1.3 billion to 2.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of growth in the commercial loan portfolio primarily due to the completion of the Partners Merger and, contributed 18.0 million to the increase in interest income. The average yield on loans increased 101 basis points on an annualized basis from 5.33 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which contributed 5.8 million to the increase in interest income. Normal amortization of net loan discounts recorded as part of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired loans contributed 3.3 million to the increase in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Overall the average yield of interest earning assets increased 103 basis points on an annualized basis to 6.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to a larger concentration of interest earning assets in loans along with an increase in the average yield earned on loans due to the current higher interest rate environment. 
 Interest Expense: Interest expense increased by 8.8 million, or 136.8 , to 15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities, which increased 967 million to 1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 877.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the increase in the average balance of our deposits and borrowings due to the completion of the Partners Merger. The increase in interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 38 basis points on an annualized basis from 2.90 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.28 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the higher interest rate environment and in particular its impact on deposit cost. Normal amortization of net discounts on acquired interest bearing liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting adjustments through the Partners Merger contributed 359 thousand to the increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 51 

Interest expense on borrowings was reduced by 383 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 due to the impact of the interest rate swap. 
 Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses is the resulting expense from the allowances for credit losses on loans, unfunded commitments, and held-to-maturity securities. The provision for credit losses was 84 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative provision of 349 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of the provision for credit losses can be attributable to an increase in specific reserves at September 30, 2024 when compared to September 30, 2023. 
 The Company completes a comprehensive quarterly evaluation to determine its provision for credit losses. The evaluation reflects analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience, and changes in net loan balances, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends, conditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors. 
 Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for additional details on the provision for credit losses. 
 Non-interest Income: Non-interest income increased by 1.8 million to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 880 thousand recognized during the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 854 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts and an increase of 253 thousand from income on bank-owned life insurance. 
 Non-interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased 10.5 million, or 130.8 , to 18.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was largely due to: (1) an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of 5.7 million related to an increase in the number of employees due to the completion of the Partners Merger; (2) an increase of 1.1 million in intangible amortization; (3) an increase of 739 thousand in occupancy expense related to increased property maintenance costs, lease costs, and deprecation expense mostly related to facilities acquired in the Partners Merger; (4) an increase of 706 thousand in equipment and data processing; and (5) an increase of 1.3 million in other expenses which consist of items such as communications expenses, insurance expenses and other administrative expenses. 
 Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.0 million compared to an income tax expense of 347 thousand for the same period in 2023 as a result of an increase in income before income tax expense. The income tax expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was the direct result of our net income adjusted for tax free income and non-deductible merger related expenses. We recognized an income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective tax rate of 22.2 . As a result of the Partners Merger, the Company now has nexus in states with applicable state corporate income taxes which is adding to the effective tax rate and resulting in a rate greater than our statutory federal tax rate of 21 . This is compared to income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.9 which is more than our federal statutory rate of 21 . 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General: Net income was 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 0.50 per diluted share, an increase of 17.6 million compared to net income of 1.0 million, or 0.06 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period was primarily the result of an increase in interest and dividend income of 76.3 million and an increase in noninterest income of 6.4 million. Offsetting the increase in net income was an increase in interest expense of 26.4 million, and an increase in non-interest expense of 33.1 million primarily as a result of the increase in salaries and employee benefits of 18.6 million due to the Partners Merger for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period. 
 Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between the interest the Company earns on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the expense the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates the Company earns or pays on them. In general, the shift in the interest rate environment that began in March of 2022 resulted in higher interest rates earned on loans, securities, and interest-earning cash as well as higher interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed money when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. Since December 31, 2021, the Federal Funds Target Rate rose from a range of 0.00 - 0.25 to a range of 5.25 - 5.50 as of September 30, 2023 which held until September 2024 and decreased to a range of 4.75 - 5.00 as of September 30, 2024. While this interest rate index is not used for all financial instruments, the interest rate indices and interest rate curves have increased over this same time horizon. The results of this overall upward shift in interest rates has generally caused net interest margins at financial institutions to contract when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period in 2023 as the cost of funds of financial institutions, generally, have risen at a faster pace than 
 52 

the yield on interest earning assets. While this trend is generally accurate across the broader banking sector, our results for the first nine months of 2024 have been positively impacted by the Partners Merger by adding increased yield on interest earning assets which outpaced the rise in funding costs when compared to the same period in 2023. As shown in the following table and subsequent discussion, our average yield on interest earning assets increased 121 basis points when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023, while our average cost of funds increased 18 basis points over that same period, resulting in an increase to net interest margin of 101 basis points.

Change in Net Interest Income

Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by 50.0 million, or 204.8 , to 74.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase can be attributed to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher average balance in interest-earning assets and an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from increased average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to the higher interest rate environment and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities. The increase in average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was a result of the completion of the Partners Merger. The net interest margin increased 101 basis points to 3.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Income: Interest income increased to 118.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 42.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans as a result of the growth in average loans as well as the increase in average yields earned on all categories of interest earning assets. The growth in average balance of interest earning assets which increased 1.4 billion to 2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 billion for the comparable period in 2023 contributed 54.6 million to the increase in interest income. The growth in the average balance of interest earning assets was due primarily to the increase in the average balance of loans which increased 1.3 billion to 2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of growth in the commercial loan portfolio primarily due to the completion of the Partners Merger. The average yield on loans increased 118 basis points on an annualized basis from 5.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which contributed 20.1 million to the increase in interest income. Normal amortization of net loan discounts recorded as part of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired loans contributed 11.4 million to interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Overall the average yield of interest earning assets increased 121 basis points on an annualized basis to 6.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to a larger concentration of interest earning assets in loans along with an increase in the average yield of interest earning cash, securities and loans. 
 Interest Expense: Interest expense increased by 26.4 million, or 149.0 , to 44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, which increased 944 million to 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 867.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the increase in the average balance of our deposits and borrowings due to the completion of the Partners Merger. The increase in interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 52 basis points on an annualized basis from 2.73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.25 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the higher interest rate environment and in particular its impact on deposits costs. Normal amortization of net discounts on acquired interest bearing liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting adjustments through the Partners Merger contributed 2.0 million to the increase in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense on borrowings was reduced by 1.2 million due to the impact of the interest rate swap. 
 Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by 674 thousand from a negative provision of 549 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a provision of 125 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 497 thousand related to loans, 331) thousand 
 54 

related to unfunded commitments, and 41) thousand related to held-to-maturity securities. The majority of the provision for credit losses can be attributable to an increase in specific reserves at September 30, 2024 when compared to September 30, 2023. 
 The Company completes a comprehensive quarterly evaluation to determine its provision for credit losses. The evaluation reflects analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience, and changes in net loan balances, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends, conditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors. 
 Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for additional details on the provision for credit losses. 
 Non-interest Income: Non-interest income increased by 6.4 million to 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from a net loss of approximately 88 thousand recognized during the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a loss on the sale in the first nine months of 2023 of an investment in the subordinated notes of Signature Bank which was taken into FDIC receivership during the 2023 first quarter. The Company sold our investment and recognized a loss of 2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 2.1 million, from 593 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Non-interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased 33.1 million, or 140.4 , from 23.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 56.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to: (1) an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of 18.6 million related to an increase in the number of employees due to the completion of the Partners Merger; (2) an increase of 3.4 million of amortization of intangible assets as a result of intangibles acquired from the Partners Merger; (3) an increase of 2.8 million in equipment and data processing costs; and (4) an increase of 2.5 million in occupancy expense related to increased property maintenance costs, lease costs, and depreciation expense mostly related to facilities acquired in the Partners Merger. 
 Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 5.3 million compared to an income tax expense of 276 thousand for the same period in 2023 as a result of an increase in income before income tax expense. The income tax expense recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the direct result of our net income adjusted for tax free income and non-deductible merger related expenses. We recognized an income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective tax rate of 22.0 . As a result of the Partners Merger, the Company now has nexus in states with applicable state corporate income taxes which is adding to the effective tax rate and resulting in a rate greater than our statutory federal tax rate of 21 . This is compared to income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.1 . 
 Liquidity, Commitments, and Capital Resources 
 The Company s liquidity, represented by cash and due from banks, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal repayments of securities and outstanding loans, and funds provided from operations. In addition, the Company invests excess funds in short-term interest-earnings assets such as overnight deposits or U.S. agency securities, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities. 
 The Company strives to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund operations, loan demand and to satisfy fluctuations in deposit levels. The Company is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound banking operations. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Our attempts to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity, and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of the Company s business management. We manage our liquidity in accordance with a board of directors-approved asset liability policy, which is administered by the Company s asset-liability committee ALCO ). ALCO reports interest rate sensitivity, liquidity, capital and investment-related matters on a quarterly basis to the Company s board of directors. 
 The Company reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024, totaled 588.3 million, or 96.3 of our certificates of deposit, and 23.8 of total deposits. Of these certificates of deposit, 75 million are brokered deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and FHLB advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Additionally, management noted that approximately 10.18 of our deposits (measured on a year-to-date average balance) consisted of balances in escrow-type deposits which are distributed among different customers with no customer exceeding our policy limits on size of deposits. While deposits are the Company s primary source of funds, when needed the Company is also able to generate cash through borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of 
 55 

Pittsburgh FHLB ). At September 30, 2024, the Company had 40.0 million in outstanding FHLB borrowings with a remaining available capacity with FHLB, subject to certain collateral restrictions, of approximately 742.8 million. 
 In addition to our available borrowing capacity at the FHLB, the Company has lines of credit with multiple financial institutions that provide an available 77 million of additional liquidity at September 30, 2024. The Company also maintains available credit at the Federal Reserve Bank's Discount Window of 26.2 million at September 30, 2024. 
 The following table shows the Company's available liquidity at September 30, 2024.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 It is management s opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the Company s business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimate, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The more significant area in which the Company's management applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: 
 Allowance for credit losses: The loan portfolio is the biggest asset on the Company's balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance for credit losses as deemed necessary by management. The allowance for credit losses consists of reserves on loans that share similar risk characteristics, and reserves on loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. 
 Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a restructured loan will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancelable by the Company. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on periodic evaluations of past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, historical credit losses experienced by peer institutions on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. This evaluation has subjective components requiring material estimates, including forecasted national economic conditions such as GDP, unemployment, and housing price indexes. Other components impacting the estimate include expected default probabilities, the expected loss given default, and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows. Of the previously listed components, the economic forecasts are the most sensitive to change. 
 Generally, loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are collateral-dependent and impairment is measured through the collateral method. When the measurement of these loans is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the shortfall is recorded through the allowance for credit losses. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional provisions for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. 
 Business Combinations: The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair value on their purchase date. As provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management has up to 12 months following the date of the acquisition to finalize the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Management continues to finalize the fair values of 
 56 

acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The valuation of acquired loans involves significant estimates, assumptions and judgment based on information available as of the acquisition date. Loans acquired in a business combination transaction are evaluated either individually or in pools of loans with similar characteristics; including consideration of a credit component. A number of factors are considered in determining the estimated fair value of purchased loans including, among other things, the remaining life of the acquired loans, estimated prepayments, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying collateral, estimated holding periods, contractual interest rates compared to market interest rates, and net present value of cash flows expected to be received.

 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations and are operating in an effective manner.
