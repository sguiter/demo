Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of Units (the Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to Alfa 24 Limited (the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters, generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4.

On May 23, 2024, the underwriters exercised
their over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional

 Units at

In connection with this sale, the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. also purchased an additional 
 Private Placement Units from the Company, generating gross proceeds of .
The issuance of the additional Private Placement Units was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As a result, on May 23, 2024, the Company paid the underwriters a cash underwriting discount
of per unit, or an additional of 300,000 for a total of . As of September 30, 2024, an aggregate of 
 has been deposited in the trust account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering. 

On July 1, 2024, the Company announced that the
holders of the Company s Units may elect to separately trade the ordinary shares, par value 
per share (the Ordinary Shares ), and rights (the Rights included in the Units commencing on July 5,
2024. Each Unit consists of one Ordinary Share and one Right, each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-twentieth
(1/20) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination. Any Units not separated will
continue to trade on The Nasdaq Global Market LLC Nasdaq under the symbol RFAIU. Any underlying
Ordinary Shares and Rights that are separated are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the symbols RFAI and
 RFAIR, respectively. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer Trust
Company, the Company s transfer agent, in order to separate the holders Units into Ordinary Shares and Rights. 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. Pursuant to applicable stock exchange listing rules, the Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). The Company intends to only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on May 21, 2024 and the overallotment on May 23, 2024, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units was placed in the trust account (the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested in demand deposit or cash accounts or invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholders, as described below. 

The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company in its sole discretion subject to requirements of corporate law. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be 10.05 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). The Public Shares subject to redemption are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . 

If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company receives an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and, subject to applicable securities laws, any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against a proposed Business Combination. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

The Sponsor and EBC have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares, EBC founder shares (defined below), Private Shares and Private Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, EBC founder shares and private shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (1) modify the substance or timing of the obligation to provide for the redemption of the public shares in connection with an initial Business Combination or to redeem 100 of the public shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (2) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, and (c) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares, EBC founder shares and private shares held by them if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. If the Company submits the initial Business Combination to the public shareholders for a vote, the Sponsor and the Company s officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any founder shares, private shares and, subject to applicable securities laws, any public shares purchased by them in or after this Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of an initial Business Combination. 

The Company has 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). However, if the Company has not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Combination Period is not extended by shareholders pursuant to an amendment to the Company s amended and restated articles of association, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining Public Shareholders and its Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The Sponsor agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares it would receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its affiliates acquires Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share, due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and as to any claims by the Company s auditors or under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Going Concern Consideration 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in cash and a working capital of . 

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs
to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination.
In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period,
the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company.
There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period.
As a result, management has determined that such an additional condition also raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Any of the above-mentioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and subsequent sanctions or related actions, could adversely affect the Company s search for an Initial Business Combination and any target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an Initial Business Combination.

The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. 

The underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit. 

On May 23, 2024, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional Units. As a result, on May 23, 2024, the Company paid the underwriters a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per unit, or an aggregate of . 

Business Combination Marketing Agreement 

The Company has engaged EBC as an advisor in connection with its Business Combination to assist in holding meetings with the Company stockholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing its securities in connection with its initial Business Combination and assist with press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. The Company will pay EBC a service fee for such services upon the consummation of its initial Business Combination in an amount equal to of the gross proceeds (an aggregate of since the underwriters over-allotment option was exercised in full) of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the Company will pay EBC a service fee in an amount equal to 1.0 of the total consideration payable in the initial Business Combination if it introduces the Company to the target business with whom it completes an initial Business Combination; provided that the foregoing fee will not be paid prior to the date that is 60 days from the effective date of the Initial Public Offering, unless FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriters compensation in connection with the Initial Public Offering pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110. 

preference shares with a par value of per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company s board of directors. As of September 30, 2024, there were preference shares issued or outstanding. 

Ordinary Shares The
Company is authorized to issue 
ordinary shares with a par value of 
per share. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of September 30, 2024, there were 
ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 
ordinary shares subject to possible redemption. 

Rights Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-twentieth (1/20) of one ordinary share upon consummation of the initial Business Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Cayman law. In the event the Company is not the surviving company upon completion of the initial Business Combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the one-twentieth (1/20) of one ordinary share underlying each right upon consummation of the Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company will redeem the public shares for the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and the rights will expire worthless. 

The over-allotment option was accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 815-40 and was presented within liabilities on the balance sheet. On May 23, 2024, the over-allotment was exercised as such the liability was eliminated and charged to accumulated deficit. 

The Company used a Black-Scholes model to value the over-allotment option. The over-allotment option liability was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs inherent in pricing models, including assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary share based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the option. The expected life of the option is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. 

The following table presents
the changes in the fair value of over-allotment option liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as of May 21, 2024
and as of September 30, 2024:

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated in the
Cayman Islands on February 5, 2024, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share
purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to pursue a Business Combination
with a target in any industry that can benefit from the expertise and capabilities of our management team. While our efforts in
identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a particular geographic region, we intend to focus our search on
businesses in Asia within the deep technology sector, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology.
However, we will not consummate an initial business combination with an entity or business with China operations consolidated
through a variable interest entity VIE structure. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we
are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. We intend to effectuate our Business
Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, our
shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. 

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from February 5, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,422,951, which consisted of interest earned on cash held in the
Trust Account of 1,512,941, offset by operating costs of 89,990. 

For the period from February 5, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,909,559, which consisted of interest
earned on cash held in the Trust Account of 2,169,630, offset by operating costs of 260,071.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, by the Sponsor, issuance of representative shares to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and advances from the Sponsor. 

On May 21, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 400,000 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters, at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 4,000,000. 

On May 23, 2024, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional 1,500,000 Units. As a result, on May 23, 2024, the Company sold an additional 1,500,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 15,000,000. In connection with this sale, the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. also purchased an additional 37,500 Private Placement Units from the Company, generating gross proceeds of 375,000. 

Following the Initial Public Offering and the private placement and the exercising of underwriters over-allotment option in full, an aggregate of 115,575,000 10.05 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred transaction costs of 5,975,732 consisting of 2,000,000 of cash underwriting fees, 3,500,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 475,732 of other offering costs. As a result of the underwriters election to exercise the over-allotment option in full on May 23, 2024, we incurred additional transaction costs of 825,000 consisting of 300,000 of cash underwriting fees and 525,000 of deferred underwriting fees. 

For the period from February 5, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 62,031. Net income
of 1,909,559 was affected by interest earned on cash held in the Trust Account of 2,169,630, payment of expenses through issuance of
ordinary shares of 25,000, and payment of expenses through advance from related party of 31,620. Changes in operating assets and liabilities
used 141,420 of cash for operating activities. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 117,744,630. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay
taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest
earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or
debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account
will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our
growth strategies. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 986,256. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and
evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements
of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination, and to pay for directors and officers liability
insurance premiums. 

In order to finance working capital deficit or to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. If the Company completes its initial Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to 1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be convertible into Working Capital Units of the post Business Combination entity at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units and the underlying securities would be identical to the Private Placement Units. 

We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. 

18 

We may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Our officers, directors and our Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time which is considered to be one year from the date of the issuance of the unaudited financial statements. The unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an aggregate of 10,000 per month to the Sponsor or an affiliate thereof for use of office space, utilities, and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on May 16, 2024 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. 

We engaged EBC as an advisor in connection with our Business Combination to assist in holding meetings with our shareholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing its securities in connection with our initial Business Combination and assist with press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. We will pay EBC a service fee for such services upon the consummation of our initial business combination in an amount equal to 3.5 of the gross proceeds, an aggregate of 4,025,000 of the Initial Public Offering (as the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full on May 23, 2024). In addition, we will pay EBC a service fee in an amount equal to 1.0 of the total consideration payable in the initial Business Combination if it introduces us to the target business with whom we complete an initial Business Combination; provided that the foregoing fee will not be paid prior to the date that is 60 days from the effective date of the Initial Public Offering, unless FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriters compensation in connection with the Initial Public Offering pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the period reported. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgement. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation, or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any critical accounting estimates to be disclosed.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Management s Quarterly Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period from February 5, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on May 16, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC, except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On May 21, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share, and one right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-twentieth of one ordinary share upon the completion of an initial business combination. 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters, purchased an aggregate of 400,000 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement generating gross proceeds of 4,000,000. 

On May 23, 2024, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional 1,500,000 Units. As a result, on May 23, 2024, the Company sold an additional 1,500,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 15,000,000. In connection with this sale, the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. also purchased an additional 37,500 Private Placement Units from the Company, generating gross proceeds of 375,000. 

We incurred transaction costs of 5,975,732 consisting of 2,000,000 of cash underwriting fees, 3,500,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 475,732 of other offering costs. As a result of the underwriters election to exercise the over-allotment option in full on May 23, 2024, we incurred additional transaction costs of 825,000 consisting of 300,000 of cash underwriting fees and 525,000 of deferred underwriting fees. 

Following the Initial Public Offering and the private placement and the election of the underwriters to exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting the underwriting fees (excluding the deferred portion of 4,025,000, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, if consummated) and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was 116,514,618 of which 115,575,000 10.05 per unit) was placed in the Trust Account. 

For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in the Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report. 

Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
