EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the reports on Form 10-Q for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 of Essex Property Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and Essex Portfolio, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership of which Essex Property Trust, Inc. is the sole general partner. 
 
 Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" mean collectively Essex Property Trust, Inc. and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Essex Property Trust, Inc., including Essex Portfolio, L.P., and references to the "Operating Partnership" mean Essex Portfolio, L.P. and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Essex Portfolio, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Essex" mean Essex Property Trust, Inc., not including any of its subsidiaries. 
 
 Essex operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"), and is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Essex has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management. 
 
 The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT ("UPREIT") and Essex contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions, Essex receives a number of Operating Partnership limited partnership units ("OP Units," and the holders of such OP Units, "Unitholders") equal to the number of shares of common stock it has issued in the equity offerings. Contributions of properties to the Company can be structured as tax-deferred transactions through the issuance of OP Units, which is one of the reasons why the Company is structured in the manner outlined above. Based on the terms of the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, OP Units can be exchanged into Essex common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Company maintains a one-for-one relationship between the OP Units issued to Essex and shares of common stock. 
 
 The Company believes that combining the reports on Form 10-Q of Essex and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 
 enhances investors' understanding of Essex and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both Essex and the Operating Partnership; and 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 
 Management operates Essex and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Essex consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 All of the Company's property ownership, development, and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and Essex has no material assets, other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Essex's primary function is acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, Essex consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Essex and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. Essex also issues equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of the Operating Partnership, as disclosed in this report. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in its co-investments. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by the Company, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units (on a one-for-one share of common stock per OP Unit basis), the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business. These sources of capital include the Operating Partnership's working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from disposition of certain properties and co-investments. 
 
 iii 

The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between Essex and the Operating Partnership in the context of how Essex and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. Stockholders' equity, partners' capital and noncontrolling interest are the main areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of Essex and those of the Operating Partnership. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's condensed consolidated financial statements and as noncontrolling interest in Essex s condensed consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership's condensed consolidated financial statements include the interest of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships and co-investment partners. The noncontrolling interest in Essex's condensed consolidated financial statements include (i) the same noncontrolling interest as presented in the Operating Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements and (ii) OP Unitholders. The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' capital result from differences in the equity issued at Essex and Operating Partnership levels. 
 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between Essex and the Operating Partnership, this report on Form 10-Q provides separate condensed consolidated financial statements for Essex and the Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of stockholders' equity or partners' capital, and earnings per share/unit, as applicable; and a combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 This report on Form 10-Q also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of Essex and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that Essex and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and 18 U.S.C. 1350. 
 
 In order to highlight the differences between Essex and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report on Form 10-Q for Essex and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to Essex and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of Essex and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and co-investments and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the Company is one business and the Company operates that business through the Operating Partnership. The separate discussions of Essex and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company. 
 
 The information furnished in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, capital, and cash flows of the Company and the Operating Partnership reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the aforementioned condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods and are normal and recurring in nature, except as otherwise noted. 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to such unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein. Additionally, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere herein and with the Company s 2023 annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Capitalized terms not defined in this section have the meaning ascribed to them elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The Company makes statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-Q entitled "Forward-Looking Statements." 
 
 Essex is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that acquires, develops, redevelops, and manages apartment communities in selected residential areas located on the West Coast of the United States. Essex owns all of its interests in its real estate investments, directly or indirectly through the Operating Partnership. Essex is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of September 30, 2024, had an approximately 96.5 general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company s investment strategy has two components: constant monitoring of existing markets, and evaluation of new markets to identify areas with the characteristics that underlie rental growth. The Company s strong financial condition supports its investment strategy by enhancing its ability to quickly shift acquisition, development, redevelopment, and disposition activities to markets that will optimize the performance of the Company's portfolio. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned or had ownership interests in 255 operating apartment communities, comprising 62,510 apartment homes, excluding the Company s ownership interest in preferred equity co-investments, loan investments, and two operating commercial buildings. 
 
 The Company s apartment communities are located in the following major regions: 
 
 Southern California (primarily Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and Ventura counties) 
 Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area) 
 Seattle Metro (the Seattle metropolitan area) 
 
 The Company s consolidated apartment communities are as follows: 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2023 Apartment Homes Apartment Homes Southern California 23,262 43 21,986 43 Northern California 20,128 37 19,245 37 Seattle Metro 10,555 20 10,341 20 Total 53,945 100 51,572 100 
 
 Co-investments, including Wesco I, Wesco III, Wesco IV, Wesco V, Wesco VI, BEX II, BEX IV and 500 Folsom communities, developments under construction, and preferred equity interest co-investment communities are not included in the table presented above for both periods. The communities previously held in the BEXAEW, Patina at Midtown, and Century Towers co-investments, which were consolidated in 2024, are excluded from the September 30, 2023 table but included in the September 30, 2024 table. 
 
 Market Considerations 
 
 The Company is emerging from restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to comply with the stated intent of local, county, state and federal laws, some of which limit rent increases during times of emergency and impair the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain timeframes and in various regions in which our communities are located, impacting the Company and its properties. Concurrently, geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts have increased uncertainty during 2023 and 2024. Inflation has caused an increase in consumer prices, thereby reducing purchasing power and elevating the risks of a recession. In response to increased inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate throughout 2022 and 2023 resulting in a significant increase of market interest rates. In the third quarter of 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate in conjunction with the softening of U.S. inflation and short term market interest rates have declined. 
 
 The long-term impact of these developments will largely depend on future laws that may be enacted, the impact on job growth and the broader economy, and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.

The Company's cash delinquencies as a percentage of scheduled rental income for the Company s stabilized apartment communities or "Same-Property" (stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023) have generally remained higher than the pre-pandemic historical average of 0.35 since the second quarter of 2020. Cash delinquencies were elevated at 2.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and has decreased to 0.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Delinquency benefited slightly from Emergency Rental Assistance payments of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to payments of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024; however, current tenant delinquencies remained above pre-pandemic levels. The Company continues to work with residents to collect such cash delinquencies. As of September 30, 2024, the delinquencies have not had a material adverse impact on the Company's liquidity position. 
 
 The foregoing macroeconomic conditions have not negatively impacted the Company's ability to access traditional funding sources on the same or reasonably similar terms as were available in recent periods prior to the pandemic. The Company is not at material risk of not meeting the covenants in its credit agreements and is able to timely service its debt and other obligations. 
 
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The average financial occupancy for the Company s Same-Property portfolio was 96.2 and 96.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total scheduled rental income. Actual rental income represents contractual rental income pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total scheduled rental income represents the value of all apartment homes, with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents. The Company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate. 
 
 Market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes. The Company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors, including overall supply and demand for housing, concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity, and rental affordability. Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates, and the Company's calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other REITs. 
 
 The Company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes. The calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes, and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions. For apartment communities that are development properties in lease-up without stabilized occupancy figures, the Company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric. While an apartment community is in the lease-up phase, the Company s primary motivation is to stabilize the property, which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives, and thus financial occupancy, which is based on contractual income, is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy. 
 
 The regional breakdown of the Company s Same-Property portfolio for financial occupancy for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Southern California 95.9 96.3 Northern California 96.4 96.6 Seattle Metro 96.6 96.3

 The following table provides a breakdown of revenues amounts, including revenues attributable to the Same-Properties: 
 Number of Apartment Homes Three Months Ended September 30, Dollar Percentage Property Revenues in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Same-Property Revenues: Southern California 21,573 176,043 169,071 6,972 4.1 Northern California 18,273 163,870 159,591 4,279 2.7 Seattle Metro 10,341 73,300 70,630 2,670 3.8 Total Same-Property Revenues 50,187 413,213 399,292 13,921 3.5 Non-Same Property Revenues 34,922 17,106 17,816 104.2 Total Property Revenues 448,135 416,398 31,737 7.6 
 
 Same-Property Revenues increased by 13.9 million or 3.5 to 413.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 399.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 1.8 in average rental rates from 2,623 per apartment home for the third quarter of 2023 to 2,669 per apartment home for the third quarter of 2024, and 1.3 of the increase was attributable to a decrease in delinquencies for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Non-Same Property Revenues increased by 17.8 million or 104.2 to 34.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 17.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of the BEXAEW portfolio, ARLO Mountain View, Maxwell Sunnyvale, Patina at Midtown, and Century Towers in 2024. 
 
 Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes increased by 8.3 million or 10.8 to 85.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 77.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases of 4.1 million in utilities expenses, 2.0 million in personnel costs, 1.4 million in administrative expenses, and 0.8 million in maintenance 
 and repairs expenses. Same-Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by 5.5 million or 7.4 to 80.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 74.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases of 2.6 million in utilities expenses, 1.3 million in insurance and other expenses, 1.1 million in personnel costs, 0.3 million in administrative expenses, and 0.2 million in maintenance and repairs expenses. 
 
 Real estate taxes increased by 2.1 million or 4.5 to 49.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 46.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in tax rates in California and the Seattle Metro region and due to acquisitions in 2024. Same-Property real estate taxes increased by 1.0 million or 2.3 to 45.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in tax rates in California and the Seattle Metro region. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 9.0 million or 6.6 to 146.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 137.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to acquisitions in 2024. 
 
 Interest expense increased by 5.0 million or 9.2 to 59.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 54.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the 298.0 million of 10-year secured loans closed in July 2023, the issuance in March 2024 and August 2024 of 550.0 million senior unsecured notes due April 2034, and increased borrowing on the two unsecured lines of credit which resulted in an increase in interest expense of 9.0 million for the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, there was a 0.2 million decrease in capitalized interest in the third quarter of 2024, due to a decrease in development activity as compared to the same period in 2023. These increases to interest expense were partially offset by various debt that was paid off, matured, or due to regular principal amortization during and after the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the payoff of the 300.0 million of senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2023 and the 400.0 million of senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2024, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of 4.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest and other income increased by 7.0 million or 159.1 to 11.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase of 10.3 million in realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, offset by a decrease of 3.8 million in interest income. 
 
 Equity income from co-investments increased by 0.9 million or 8.4 to 11.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 10.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 2.4 million in equity loss from co-investments, offset by a decrease of 1.4 million in income from preferred equity investments.

 Interest expense increased by 16.5 million or 10.5 to 174.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 157.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to borrowing on the 300.0 million unsecured term loan in April 2023, the 298.0 million of 10-year secured loans closed in July 2023, the issuance in March 2024 and August 2024 of 550.0 million senior unsecured notes due April 2034, and increased borrowing on the two unsecured lines of credit which resulted in an increase in interest expense of 26.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, there was a 0.5 million decrease in capitalized interest in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to a decrease in development activity as compared to the same period in 2023. These increases to interest expense were partially offset by various debt that was paid off, matured, or due to regular principal amortization during and after the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the payoff of the 300.0 million of senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2023 and the 400.0 million of senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2024, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of 10.2 million for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest and other income increased by 49.2 million or 169.1 to 78.3 million in income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases of 34.8 million in legal settlements, 7.1 million in interest income, and 6.4 million in realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities. 
 
 Equity income from co-investments decreased by 0.1 million or 0.3 to 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 33.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 3.7 million of impairment loss from an unconsolidated co-investment, and decreases of 4.4 million in income from preferred equity investments, including income from early redemption of preferred equity investments, and 0.7 million in insurance reimbursements, legal settlements, and other, net. The decreases were partially offset by increases of 4.9 million in equity income from non-core technology co-investments, 1.5 million in co-investment promote income, and a decrease of 2.4 million in equity loss from co-investments. 
 
 Gain on remeasurement of co-investment of 169.9 million resulted from the Company's acquisition of its joint venture partner's interests in the BEXAEW portfolio, Patina at Midtown and Century Towers. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 71.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 75.2 million in marketable securities, all of which were equity securities. The Company believes that cash flows generated by its operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities balances and availability under existing lines of credit are sufficient to meet all of its anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months. Additionally, the capital markets continue to be available and the Company is able to generate cash from the disposition of real estate assets to finance additional cash flow needs, including continued development and select acquisitions. In the event that economic disruptions occur, the Company may further utilize other resources such as its cash reserves, lines of credit, or decreased investment in redevelopment activities to supplement operating cash flows. The Company is carefully monitoring and managing its cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations. The timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect the Company's plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Moody s Investor Service, and Standard and Poor's credit agencies rated the Company and the Operating Partnership, Baa1/Stable, and BBB+/Stable, respectively.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had two unsecured lines of credit aggregating 1.28 billion. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance on the Company's 1.2 billion unsecured line of credit. The underlying interest rate is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's credit ratings, adjusted for the Company's sustainability metric adjustment feature, and was at the Adjusted SOFR plus 0.765 as of September 30, 2024. This facility is scheduled to mature in January 2029, with two six-month extensions, exercisable at the Company's option. As of September 30, 2024, there was 7.9 million outstanding balance on the Company's 75.0 million working capital unsecured line of credit. The underlying interest rate on the 75.0 million line is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's credit ratings, adjusted for the Company's sustainability metric adjustment feature, and was at the Adjusted SOFR plus 0.765 as of September 30, 2024. This facility is scheduled to mature in July 2026. 
 
 In March 2024, the Operating Partnership issued 350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due on April 1, 2034 with a coupon rate of 5.500 per annum (the "2034 Notes"), which are payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024. The 2034 Notes were offered to investors at a price of 99.752 of the principal amount. The 2034 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership, rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and are unconditionally guaranteed by Essex. The Company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay debt maturities, including to fund a portion of the repayment of its outstanding 3.875 senior unsecured notes due May 2024 and for other general corporate and working capital purposes. In August 2024, the Operating Partnership issued an additional 200.0 million of the 2034 Notes at a price of 102.871 of the principal amount, plus accrued interest from and including March 2024, up to, but excluding, the settlement date of August 21, 2024, with an effective yield of 5.110 per annum. These additional notes have substantially identical terms of the 2034 Notes issued in March 2024. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 900.0 million (the "2024 ATM Program"). In connection with the 2024 ATM Program, the Company may also enter into related forward sale agreements whereby, at the Company's discretion, it may sell shares of its common stock under the 2024 ATM Program under forward sale agreements. The use of a forward sale agreement would allow the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of its common stock at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receipt of the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. 
 
 The 2024 ATM Program replaced the prior equity distribution agreement entered into in September 2021 (the "2021 ATM Program"), which was terminated upon the establishment of the 2024 ATM Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not sell any shares of its common stock through the 2024 ATM Program or the 2021 ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, there are no outstanding forward purchase agreements, and 900.0 million of shares remains available to be sold under the 2024 ATM Program. 
 
 In December 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to allow the Company to acquire shares in an aggregate of up to 250.0 million. In February 2019, the Board of Directors approved the replenishment of the stock repurchase plan such that, as of each date, the Company had 250.0 million of purchase authority remaining under the stock repurchase plan. In each of May and December 2020, the Board of Directors approved the replenishment of the stock repurchase plan such that, as of such date, the Company had 250.0 million of purchase authority remaining under the replenished plan. In September 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan to allow the Company to acquire shares of common stock up to an aggregate value of 500.0 million. The plan supersedes the Company's previous common stock repurchase plan announced in December 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 302.7 million of purchase authority remaining under its 500.0 million stock repurchase plan. 
 
 Essex pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution. Until it is distributed, cash available for distribution is invested by the Company primarily in investment grade securities held available for sale or is used by the Company to reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit. 
 
 Development and Predevelopment Pipeline 
 
 The Company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed, or are newly constructed and are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s development pipeline was comprised of various consolidated predevelopment projects, with total incurred costs of 25.1 million. 
 
 The Company defines predevelopment projects as proposed communities in negotiation or in the entitlement process with an expected high likelihood of becoming entitled development projects. The Company may also acquire land for future development purposes or sale. 
 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 The Company expects to fund the development and predevelopment communities by using a combination of some or all of the following sources: its working capital, amounts available on its lines of credit, construction loans, net proceeds from public and private equity and debt issuances, and proceeds from the disposition of assets, if any. 
 
 Derivative Activity 
 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, and total return swap contracts to manage certain interest rate risks. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps and total return swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. 
 
 Alternative Capital Sources 
 
 The Company utilizes co-investments as an alternative source of capital for acquisitions of both operating and development communities. The Company had an interest in 8,565 apartment homes of operating communities with joint ventures and technology co-investments for a total book value of 409.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company has various unconsolidated interests in certain joint ventures. The Company does not believe that these unconsolidated investments have a materially different impact on its liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its consolidated operations. See Note 4, Co-investments, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for carrying values and combined summarized financial information of these unconsolidated investments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company defines critical accounting estimates as those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. The Company s critical accounting estimates relate principally to the following key areas: (i) accounting for the acquisition of investments in real estate; and (ii) evaluation of events and changes in circumstances indicating whether the Company s rental properties may be impaired. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates made by management. 
 
 The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed materially from the information reported in Note 2, Summary of Critical and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement this information for any reason, and therefore, they may not represent the Company s estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. 
 
 Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders 
 
 Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders ("FFO") is a financial measure that is commonly used in the REIT industry. The Company presents FFO and FFO excluding non-core items (referred to as "Core FFO") as supplemental operating performance measures. FFO and Core FFO are not used by the Company as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net income computed under U.S. GAAP as an indicator of the Company s operating performance or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under U.S. GAAP as an indicator of the Company s ability to fund its cash needs. 
 
 FFO and Core FFO are not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and do not present, nor do they intend to present, a complete picture of the Company's financial condition and operating performance. The Company believes that net income computed under U.S. GAAP is the primary measure of performance and that FFO and Core FFO are only meaningful when they are used in conjunction with net income. 
 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 The Company considers FFO and Core FFO to be useful financial performance measurements of an equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, FFO and Core FFO provide investors with additional bases to evaluate operating performance and ability of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and to pay dividends. By excluding gains or losses related to sales of depreciated operating properties and land, excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates) and excluding impairment write-downs from operating real estate and unconsolidated co-investments driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of real estate held by the co-investment, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. By further adjusting for items that are not considered part of the Company s core business operations, Core FFO allows investors to compare the core operating performance of the Company to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company s actual operating results. The Company believes that its condensed consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance. 
 
 In calculating FFO, the Company follows the definition for this measure published by the National Associate of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), which is the leading REIT industry association. The Company believes that, under the NAREIT FFO definition, the two most significant adjustments made to net income are (i) the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and (ii) the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties. The Company agrees that these two NAREIT adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons: 
 
 (a) historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP assumes, through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. NAREIT stated in its White Paper on Funds from Operations "since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves." Consequently, NAREIT s definition of FFO reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by U.S. GAAP do not reflect the underlying economic realities. 
 
 (b) REITs were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long-term ownership and management of real estate. The exclusion, in NAREIT s definition of FFO, of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. 
 
 Management believes that it has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented. However, there is judgment involved and other REITs calculation of FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosure of FFO may not be comparable to the Company s calculation.

 Net Operating Income 
 
 Net operating income ("NOI") and Same-Property NOI are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of income. The presentation of Same-Property NOI assists with the presentation of the Company s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. The Company defines Same-Property NOI as Same-Property revenues less Same-Property operating expenses, including property taxes. Please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to NOI and Same-Property NOI, which in the table below is the NOI for stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the periods presented in thousands):

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
 
 Interest Rate Hedging Activities 
 
 The Company s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had one interest rate swap contract to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows on the 300.0 million unsecured term loan. 
 
 The Company's interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge as of September 30, 2024. The following table summarizes the notional amount, carrying value, and estimated fair value of the Company s cash flow hedge derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of September 30, 2024. The notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rates or market risks. The table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the Company s derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10-year Treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points, as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, the Company has entered into total return swap contracts, with an aggregate notional amount of 222.0 million that effectively convert 222.0 million of fixed mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index plus a spread and have a carrying value of zero at September 30, 2024. The Company is exposed to insignificant interest rate risk on these total return swaps as the related mortgages are callable, at par, by the Company, co-terminus with the termination of any related swap. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitive Liabilities 
 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company's real estate investment portfolio and operations. The Company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, the Company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 
 The Company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows. 
 
 For the Years Ended 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair value in thousands, except for interest rates) Fixed rate debt 553 632,035 548,291 419,558 517,000 3,748,000 5,865,437 5,582,319 Average interest rate 3.2 3.5 3.5 3.8 2.2 3.6 3.5 Variable rate debt (1)

 (1) 222.0 million of variable rate debt is tax exempt to the note holders. 
 
 The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of September 30, 2024. It does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, the Company's ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise prior to settlement.

 43 

(a) the amount of the Committed Borrowing or the Letter of Credit, which in the case of a Committed Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than (i) 500,000 (or the remaining Availability, if less) for Reference Rate Committed Borrowings or Swing Loans, and (ii) 1,000,000 and increments of 500,000 in excess thereof for any Committed Borrowings for Term SOFR Rate Loans and Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans

 Unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, during the existence of a Default or Event of Default, Borrower may not elect to have a Committed Loan made as, or converted into or continued as, a Term SOFR Rate Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3 , any amount drawn under a Letter of Credit shall, from and after the date on which such drawing is made, constitute a Committed Borrowing for all purposes under this Agreement (including accrual and payment of interest and repayment of principal) other than disbursement of Committed Loan proceeds under this Section 2.3 . After giving effect to any Loan, there shall not be more than ten (10) different Interest Periods in effect. 
 In the event a requested Committed Borrowing constitutes a SOFR Committed Borrowing or a Reference Rate Committed Borrowing, Administrative Agent shall provide each Lender with the Notice of Committed Borrowing or Conversion Continuation relating thereto on the date that Administrative Agent receives such Notice of Committed Borrowing or Conversion Continuation (as applicable) from Borrower, together with the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the amount of the Committed Loans to be funded with such Committed Borrowing. Each Lender shall make the amount specified by Administrative Agent in such notice to such Lender available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent s Office not later than 2 00 p.m. on the day specified in such Notice of Committed Borrowing or Conversion Continuation. 
 2.4 Loan Accounts Notes . 
 2.4.1 Loan Accounts . The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more loan accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The loan accounts or records maintained by Administrative Agent and each Lender shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive of the amounts of the Loans made by the Lenders to Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect Borrower s obligations hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans. In addition to the 
 44 

accounts and records referred to above, each Lender and Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
 2.4.2 Notes . Upon the request of any Lender made through Administrative Agent, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through Administrative Agent) a promissory note as set forth in this Section 2.4.2. The Committed Loans made by each Lender may be evidenced by a Revolving Note in the form of Exhibit G-l hereto, payable to the order of such Lender in an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Maximum Commitment Amount on the Closing Date. In addition, the Swing Loans made by the Swing Line Lender may be evidenced by a Swing Line Note in the form of Exhibit G-2 hereto, payable to the order of the Swing Line Lender in the maximum amount of 50,000,000. In addition, the Bid Loans that may be made by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.18 may be evidenced by Bid Notes payable to the order of each Lender, in the form of Exhibit G-3 hereto. Each Lender may endorse on any schedule annexed to its Note(s) the date, amount and maturity of each Loan that it makes in the case of Committed Loans (which shall not include undrawn amounts on outstanding Letters of Credit, but shall include the amounts of any drawings on outstanding Letters of Credit), and the amount of each payment of principal that Borrower makes with respect thereto. Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Lender to endorse its Note(s), and such Lender s record shall be conclusive absent manifest error provided , however, that any Lender s failure to make, or its error in making, a notation thereon with respect to any Loan shall not limit or otherwise affect Borrower s obligations to such Lender hereunder or under its Note(s). 
 2.5 Letters of Credit . 
 2.5.1 Letter of Credit Drawings and Reimbursements Funding of Participations . 
 (a) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L C Issuer shall notify Borrower and Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11 00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date ), Borrower shall reimburse the L C Issuer through Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If Borrower fails to so reimburse the L C Issuer by such time, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Reference Rate Committed Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.3 for the principal amount of Reference Rate Committed Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the delivery of a Notice of Committed Borrowing or Conversion Continuation). Any notice given by the L C Issuer or Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.5.1(a) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 
 45 

(b) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.5.1(a) make funds available to Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer, at Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 2 00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.5.1(c) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Reference Rate Committed Loan to Borrower in such amount. Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L C Issuer. 
 (c) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Reference Rate Committed Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L C Issuer, an L C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.10.3 . In such event, each Lender s payment to Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.5.1(b) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.5.1 . 
 (d) Until each Lender funds its Loan or L C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.5.1 to reimburse the L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L C Issuer. 
 (e) Each Lender s obligation to make Loans or L C Advances to reimburse the L C Issuer, for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.5.1 , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L C Issuer, Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (iii) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing provided , however , that each Lender s obligation to make Loans pursuant to this Section 2.5.1 is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than delivery by Borrower of a Notice of Committed Borrowing or Conversion Continuation). No such making of an L C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of Borrower to reimburse the L C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (f) If any Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5.1 by the time specified in Section 2.5.1(b) , the L C Issuer, shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.5.1(f) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 
 46 

2.5.2 Repayment of Participations . 
 (a) At any time after the L C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender s L C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.5.1 , if Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by Administrative Agent), Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by Administrative Agent. 
 (b) If any payment received by Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.5.1(a) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.9 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L C Issuer, in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the L C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. 
 2.5.3 Obligations Absolute . The obligation of Borrower to reimburse the L C Issuer, for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following 
 (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document 
 (b) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense or other right that Borrower or any subsidiary of Borrower or Joint Venture may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L C Issuer, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction 
 (c) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit 
 (d) any payment by the L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any payment made by the L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any 
 47 

transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any insolvency or bankruptcy law or 
 (e) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Borrower or any subsidiary of Borrower or Joint Venture. 
 Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, Borrower will promptly notify the L C Issuer. Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
 2.5.4 Role of Letter of Credit Issuer . Each Lender and Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L C Issuer, Administrative Agent or any of their respective Related Parties nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (a) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Requisite Lenders, as applicable (b) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct or (c) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit provided , however , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L C Issuer, Administrative Agent or any of their respective Related Parties, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (e) of Section 2.5.3 . In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.5.3 or in this Section 2.5.4 , Borrower or any subsidiary of Borrower or Joint Venture for whose benefit a Letter of Credit was issued may have a claim against the L C Issuer, and the L C Issuer may be liable to Borrower or such subsidiary of Borrower or Joint Venture, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by Borrower or such subsidiary or Joint Venture which Borrower or such subsidiary or Joint Venture proves were caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the L C Issuer or the willful failure of the L C Issuer to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. 
 
 48 

2.5.5 Cash Collateral . Upon the request of Administrative Agent, (a) if the L C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L C Borrowing, or (b) if, as of the Letter of Credit expiration date, any Letter of Credit for any reason remains outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit plus the aggregate of all Unreimbursed Amounts (determined as of the date of such L C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit expiration date, as the case may be). Sections 2.8.2(a) and 8.2 .3 set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and the L C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders).

 70 

3.3.3 Delay in Requests .

 (a) the failure of Borrower to make any required payment or prepayment of principal of any Term SOFR Rate Loan (including payments made after any acceleration thereof)
