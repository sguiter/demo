 investment purposes. In addition, CALP purchased approximately million shares of the Company s common stock in connection
 with the Loan Portfolio Acquisition with the intention of distributing such shares of the Company s common stock to CALP s members within of the Loan Portfolio Acquisition. The Adviser and CALP do not expect to hold the Company s common stock indefinitely, and may sell the Company s common stock, or distribute the Company s common stock to their

 the Company s common stock on a periodic basis. Sales of substantial amounts of the Company s common stock, including by the Adviser, CALP, their members or other large stockholders, or the availability of such common stock for sale, could
 adversely affect the prevailing market prices for the Company s common stock. If this occurs and continues for a sustained period of time, it could impair the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities,

Item 2. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis or our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes that are
 included in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those
 anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere
 in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Please also see the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview

We were formed in January 2021 as a Maryland corporation and structured as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be treated as a BDC under
 the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended March 31, 2022. 

We are a specialty finance company focused on investing in companies in highly complex and highly regulated industries typically underserved by
 other capital providers, including investing across the cannabis ecosystem through investments in the form of direct loans to privately held cannabis companies. Although we focus on investments in the cannabis industry, we may also invest in growth
 capital and technology companies, esoteric and asset-based lending opportunities, and liquidity solutions opportunities as described further below. 

Our investment objective is to maximize risk-adjusted returns on equity for our shareholders. We seek to capitalize on, among other things, what we
 believe to be nascent cannabis industry growth, and drive return on equity by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-related investments. We intend to achieve our investment objective
 by investing primarily in secured debt, unsecured debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held businesses. We intend that our debt investments will often be secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of
 the portfolio company, can include either fixed or floating rate terms and will generally have a term of between three and six years from the original investment date. To date, we have invested in first lien secured, fixed and floating rate debt with
 terms of two to four years. We expect our secured loans to be secured by various types of assets of our borrowers. While the types of collateral securing any given secured loan will depend on the nature of the borrower s business, common types of
 collateral we expect to secure our loans include real property and certain personal property, including equipment, inventory, receivables, cash, intellectual property rights and other assets to the extent permitted by applicable laws and the
 regulations governing our borrowers. Certain attractive assets of our borrowers, such as cannabis licenses and cannabis inventory, may not be able to be used as collateral or transferred to us. In some of our portfolio investments, we expect to
 receive nominally priced equity warrants and/or make direct equity investments in connection with a debt investment. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including total return swaps. 

Generally, the loans we invest in have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse
 changes in a portfolio company s financial performance. However, we may invest in covenant-lite loans. We use the term covenant-lite to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally,
 covenant-lite loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather
 than by a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to
 investments in or exposure to loans with a complete set of financial maintenance covenants.

29 

Table of Contents 

The loans in which we tend to invest typically pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of PRIME plus a premium. The loans in
 which we have invested and expect to invest are typically made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. (including emerging market) corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.
 These loans typically are not rated or are rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as high-yield or junk securities, and may be considered a higher risk than debt instruments that are rated
 above investment grade.

We have typically invested in and expect to continue to invest in loans made primarily to private leveraged lower middle-market and middle-market companies
 with up to 100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. Our business model is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors. We
 expect that our investments will generally range between 5 million and 60 million each, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We have an active pipeline of investments and are
 currently reviewing approximately 559 million of potential investments in varying stages of underwriting.

The Company is currently exploring various financing options.

The following describes the four primary current sub-strategies of our principal investment strategy. We are not required to have a minimum investment in
 any of these sub-strategies. 

Cannabis 

All of our cannabis investments are designed to be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which they are made or
 to which we are otherwise subject, including U.S. federal laws. We will make equity investments only in companies that are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate, including
 U.S. federal laws. We may make loans to companies that we determine based on our due diligence are licensed in, and complying with, state-regulated cannabis programs, regardless of their status under U.S. federal law, so long as the investment
 itself is designed to be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the investment is made or to which we are otherwise subject, including U.S. federal law. We are externally managed by the Adviser and seek to
 expand the compliant cannabis investment activities of the Adviser s leading investment platform in the cannabis industry. We primarily seek to partner with private equity firms, entrepreneurs, business owners and management teams to provide credit
 and equity financing alternatives to support buyouts, recapitalizations, growth initiatives, refinancings and acquisitions across cannabis companies, including cannabis-enabling technology companies, cannabis-related health and wellness companies,
 and hemp and cannabidiol CBD distribution companies. Under normal circumstances, each such cannabis company derives at least 50 of its revenues or profits from, or commits at least 50 of its assets to, activities related to cannabis at the
 time of our investment in the cannabis company. We are not required to invest a specific percentage of our assets in such cannabis companies, and we may make debt and equity investments in other companies regardless of sector.

The Adviser seeks to invest in cannabis companies that it believes have some or all of the following characteristics:

Growth or EBITDA positive entities

Companies that require capital but do not want to dilute their equity

Companies that are showing strong cash flow performance with low leverage profiles

Transactions tend to be attractively priced and have better than normal covenants and amortization due to complexity of the industry

Low debt to enterprise value

Growth Capital Technology 

Our growth capital and technology sub-strategy is focused on industry leaders and disruptive companies that are experiencing strong growth trajectories
 and typically need capital to support continued revenue growth or expansion of the business. In most cases, these businesses have found a niche in their respective markets, proven their customer value proposition, and have already reached
 significant revenue milestones. These businesses include both private equity and venture capital backed businesses, as well as non-sponsor backed companies. In most cases, a significant amount of equity capital has been raised, resulting in low
 overall loan to enterprise value.

The Adviser seeks to invest in growth capital and technology focused companies that it believes have some or all of the following characteristics:

Industry leaders and disruptive companies experiencing strong growth

Companies that have raised significant equity capital validating market value

Industry focus typically includes software, hardware, e-commerce and direct to consumer

Liquidity covenants that ensure such company has adequate cash runway

Low debt to enterprise value

Profitable or demonstrated path to near term profitability

30 

Table of Contents 

Esoteric Asset-Based Lending 

The esoteric and asset-based lending sub-strategy is focused on established companies with strong cash flow profiles in industries that carry
 idiosyncratic or reputational risks, which limit access to traditional sources of capital. The sub-strategy also includes companies or opportunities that have strong asset collateral coverage, low loan values or other attractive risk-reward
 features. The lack of access to traditional sources of capital typically enables us to extract lender-friendly terms and covenants from companies with relatively low leverage and overall credit risk.

The Adviser seeks to invest in esoteric and asset-based lending companies that it believes have some or all of the following characteristics:

Structured credit and asset-based loans, receivables pools and equipment

Companies that are showing strong cash flow performance with low leverage profiles, but the industries carry regulatory, reputational or other
 risks

Transactions tend to be attractively priced and have better than normal covenants and amortization due to complexity of the industry or
 situation

Low debt to asset values and/or enterprise values

Liquidity Solutions 

The liquidity solutions lending sub-strategy is typically focused on event-driven opportunities including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions,
 refinancings, dividend recaps or other strategically driven liquidity needs to established businesses. These businesses also tend to be in complex industries, have time-sensitive aspects to financing, or require idiosyncratic structuring expertise
 that enables us to extract relatively lender friendly terms and covenants.

The Adviser seeks to invest in liquidity solutions opportunities that it believes have some or all of the following characteristics:

Financing is typically event driven

Companies that are pursuing a merger, acquisition, refinancing, dividend recap, or other strategic liquidity need

Companies that are showing strong cash flow performance with low leverage profiles

Companies that have multiple areas of value and liquidity in addition to the underlying business

Low debt to enterprise value

Industry agnostic

None of our investment policies are fundamental, and thus may be changed without stockholder approval.

We are externally managed by the Adviser. The Adviser also provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. We believe that our ability to leverage the existing investment management
 platform of Chicago Atlantic enables us to operate more efficiently and with lower overhead costs than other funds of comparable size.

Revenues

We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests
 obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to six years. Our loan portfolio will bear interest at a fixed or floating rate, subject to interest
 rate floors in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments will generally be payable either monthly or quarterly, but may be semi-annually.

Our investment portfolio consists of fixed and floating rate loans, and our credit facilities, if any, will bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like PRIME may affect our
 net investment income (loss) over the long term.

We accrete premiums or amortize discounts into interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments. Repayments of our debt investments will reduce interest income in future periods. The frequency or volume
 of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We will record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income.

Dividend income on equity investments, if applicable, will be recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies.

Our portfolio activity may also reflect the proceeds from sales of investments. We will recognize realized gains or losses on sales of investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from
 the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We will record current-period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of
 the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments on the Statements of Operations.

Expenses

Our primary operating expenses are a base management fee and any incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Our investment management fee compensates our Adviser for its work in
 identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring, servicing and realizing our investments. See Item 1. Business Investment Advisory Agreement. 

Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, the base
 compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We may bear our allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates)
 to our CFO and CCO and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). We may bear any other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation)
 fees and expenses relating to:

the cost of our organization and offerings;

the cost of calculating our NAV, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;

fees and expenses payable under any underwriting agreements, if any;

cost of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation
 of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing;

the cost of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholder or director meetings and the compensation of investor relations
 personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;

brokerage commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;

research and market data;

fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;

direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing and staff;

fees and expenses associated with independent audits, and outside legal and consulting costs;

costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes;

extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and

costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws.

We expect, but cannot assure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such
 periods.

Hedging

To the extent that any of our investments are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange
 rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in
 entering into such contracts or in connection with settling them will be borne by us.

Credit risk is the risk of default or non-performance by portfolio companies, equivalent to the investment s carrying amount. Industry and sector concentrations will vary from period to period based on
 portfolio activity.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had two portfolio companies that represented 67.7 and 77.0 
 respectively, of the fair values of our portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our largest portfolio company represented 35.6 and 38.7 , respectively,
 of the total fair values of our investments in portfolio companies.

Portfolio Asset Quality

Our portfolio management team uses an ongoing investment risk rating system to characterize and monitor our outstanding investments. Our portfolio management team monitors and, when appropriate,
 recommends changes to the investment risk ratings. Our Adviser s Valuation Committee reviews the recommendations and/or changes to the investment risk ratings, which are submitted on a quarterly basis to the Board of Directors and its Audit
 Committee.

 Performance

 Risk Rating

Summary Description

Grade 1

Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are
 generally favorable. Full return of principal, interest and dividend income is expected.

Grade 2

Investment is performing in-line with expectations. Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk factors remain neutral or
 favorable compared with initial underwriting. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2.

Grade 3

Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition. Capital impairment or payment delinquency is not
 anticipated. The investment may also be out of compliance with certain financial covenants.

Grade 4

Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being
 generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due). Delinquency of interest and / or dividend payments in anticipated. No loss of principal is anticipated.

Grade 5

Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. It is anticipated that the Company
 will not recoup its initial cost and may realize a loss upon exit. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce
 the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered.

We generate revenues primarily in the form of investment income from the investments we hold, generally in the form of interest income from our debt securities. We also generate revenues in the form of
 investment income from the cash we hold, generally in the form of interest income from our investment in a money market fund. Stated interest income represents interest income recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan
 agreement. Stated interest income from original issue discount OID and market discount represent the accretion into interest income over the term of the loan as a yield enhancement. Interest income from payment-in-kind PIK represents
 contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance recorded on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected.

The Company also recognizes certain fees as one-time fee income, including, but not limited to, advisory and commitment fees.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , total investment income was approximately 3.2 million and 9.0 million, which is
 attributable to 0.5 million and 0.8 million of fee income related to commitment fees, advisory fees, amendment fees and administrative fees and 2.7 million and 8.2 million of interest income, respectively. For the three and nine months ended
 September 30, 2023, total investment income was approximately 2.9 million and 8.3 million, which is attributable to 0.0 million and 0.2 million of fee income related to administrative and amendment fees and 2.9 million and 8.1 million of
 interest income, respectively.

Net Investment Income

Net investment income was approximately 0.0 million and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 1.6 million and 4.9 million for the three and nine months
 ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fluctuation in net investment income is primarily due to transaction fees of 2.4 million and 5.1 million incurred in connection with the Loan Portfolio Acquisition during the three and nine months ended
 September 30, 2024, although the impact of such fees was partially offset by the increases in investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as
 discussed above. While we consider these fees to be largely non-recurring and anticipate less transaction fees going forward, we acknowledge the possibility of unforeseen transaction-related costs in future periods.

Net Realized Gains and Losses

Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of an investment or a financial instrument and the amortized cost basis of the investment or financial
 instrument, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period. There were no sales or redemptions of investments during the three and
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 . There was 0 and 210,767 in net realized losses from the sale of an investment during the three and nine months ended
 September 30, 2023, respectively.

Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) from Investments

Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from investments primarily reflects the net change in the fair value as of the last business day of the reporting period, including the reversal of
 previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. We record current-period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized
 appreciation (depreciation) on investments on the Statements of Operations.

Net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of the following:

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of offerings of securities and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities.

In addition, we expect to enter into a credit facility in the future. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any
 proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our
 investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing.

Our primary use of funds will be investments in debt and equity securities, dividend payments to holders of our common stock who opt out of the DRIP, and the payment of operating expenses.
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash resources of approximately 30.1 million and 32.6 million, respectively, and no indebtedness. 

To maintain its tax treatment as a RIC, the Company must meet specified source-of-income requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders for each taxable year at least 90 of its investment
 company taxable income. Additionally, in order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of its net ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of
 its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such
 years.

Dividends may also be distributed in accordance with the Company s dividend reinvestment plan DRIP ), which provides for the reinvestment of distributions in the form of common stock on behalf of its
 stockholders, unless a stockholder has elected to receive distributions in cash. As a result, if the Company declares a cash distribution, its stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP by the opt out date will have their cash distribution
 automatically reinvested into additional shares of the Company s common stock. The share requirements of the DRIP may be satisfied through the issuance of common shares or through open market purchases of common shares by the DRIP plan administrator.

U.S. Federal Income Taxes

We elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay
 corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits. To obtain and maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, meet specified
 source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Basis of Presentation

The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and pursuant to Regulation S-X under the
 Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Company follows accounting and reporting guidance as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Topic 946 Financial Services Investment Companies.

37 

Table of Contents 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in our financial statements. We will
 continuously evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates will be based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
 the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional information, please refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the financial statements
 included with this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Valuation of investments is considered to be our critical accounting policy and estimates. A discussion of our critical accounting estimates follows.

Investment Valuation

Investments for which market quotations are readily available will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to
 determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as
 determined in good faith by the Adviser, as the Company s valuation designee (the Valuation Designee ), based on inputs that may include valuations, or ranges of valuations, provided by independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged by the
 Adviser. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board designated the Adviser as the Valuation Designee to perform the fair value determinations for the Company, subject to the oversight of the Board and certain Board reporting and other
 requirements.

As part of the valuation process, the Adviser takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio
 company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the
 portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar
 investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Adviser considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation . 

The Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:

With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations;

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the Adviser s valuation committee establishing a preliminary valuation of each investment, which
 may be based on valuations, or ranges of valuations, provided by independent valuation firm(s);

Preliminary valuations are documented and discussed by the Adviser s valuation committee and, where appropriate, the independent valuation firm(s); and

The Adviser determines the fair value of each investment.

We conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.

We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S.
 GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
 date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we
 consider the principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In
 accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:

Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date;

Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or for which all
 significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

38 

Table of Contents 

All of our investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are categorized at Level 3, and therefore, 100 of our portfolio requires significant estimates. Our investments may not have
 readily available market quotations (as such term is defined in Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act), and those investments which do not have readily available market quotations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with our
 valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a
 consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Significant unobservable inputs create uncertainty in the measurement of fair value as of the reporting date. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value
 measurement of the Company s debt investments may vary and may include yield and volatility fluctuations. Significant increases (decreases) in discount rate in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value assessment.
 Significant increases (decreases) in volatility in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value assessment. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s equity and warrant investments
 may vary and may include EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples and asset multiples. Significant increases (decreases) in EBITDA, revenue and asset multiple inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value assessment.

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period.
 Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further,
 such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize
 amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.

In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different
 than the unrealized gains or losses reflected previously.

Assumptions, or unobservable inputs, fluctuate based on both market and company specific factors. Please refer to Note 4 Fair Value of Financial Instruments in the notes to the financial statements
 included with this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for specific unobservable inputs.

Other Contractual Obligations

We have certain commitments pursuant to our Investment Advisory Agreement that we have entered into with the Adviser. We have agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory services consisting of two
 components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be equal to (1) a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. See Item 1. Business Investment
 Advisory Agreement. We have also entered into a contract with the Adviser to serve as our administrator. Payments under the Administration Agreement will be reimbursements to the Adviser for the costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in
 performing its obligations, including but not limited to maintaining and keeping all books and records and providing personnel and facilities. This includes costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in connection with the delegation of its
 obligations to a sub-administrator. The Company is not responsible for the compensation of the Adviser s employees and overhead expenses. See Item 1. Business Administration Agreement. 

Unfunded Commitments

The Company s commitments and contingencies include unfunded commitments to extend credit in the form of loans to the Company s portfolio companies. A portion of these unfunded contractual commitments
 are generally dependent upon the portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available. Furthermore, the Company s credit agreements with its portfolio companies generally contain customary lending provisions that
 allow the Company relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook of the company. Since
 a portion of these commitments may expire without being drawn, unfunded contractual commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As such, the Company s disclosure of unfunded contractual commitments as of September 30, 2024
 includes only those commitments that are available at the request of the portfolio company and are unencumbered by milestones or additional lending provisions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding commitments to fund investments
 totaling 1.5 million. The Company has identified no unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2023.

The Company did not have any other off-balance sheet financings or liabilities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company will fund its unfunded commitments, if any, from the same
 sources it uses to fund its investment commitments that are funded at the time they are made (which are typically through existing cash and cash equivalents) and maintains adequate liquidity to fund its unfunded commitments through these sources.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that provide a variety of representations and warranties, and general indemnifications. Such contracts include those with certain
 service providers, brokers and trading counterparties. Any exposure to the Company under these arrangements is unknown as it would involve future claims that may be made against the Company; however, based on the Company s experience, the risk of
 loss is remote and no such claims are expected to occur. As such, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications.

Shares of BDCs may trade at a market price that is less than the value of the net assets attributable to those shares. At times, our shares of common stock have traded at prices both above and below our
 net asset value per share. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from net asset value per share or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term are separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset
 value per share will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether our common stock will trade at, above, or below net asset value per share.

Holders

As of November 5, 2024, there were approximately 9 holders of record of our common stock, which does not include stockholders for whom shares are held in nominee or street name. 

Distributions

We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend
 on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.

Table of Contents 

We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended March
 31, 2022. As long as we qualify as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to stockholders on a
 timely basis.

To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) at least 90 of the sum of our: investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus
 the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross
 tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year.

As a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders. The
 discussion below assumes that we will qualify to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal tax purposes each year.

We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to
 corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current-year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below.

Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current-year distributions into the next tax year. We will be subject to a 4 
 excise tax on a certain portion of these undistributed amounts. Please refer to Item 1. Business Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for further information regarding the consequences of our retention of net capital gains. We may, in
 the future, make actual distributions to our stockholders of our net capital gains. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, if we issue senior securities, we may be prohibited
 from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings. See Item 1. Business Business Development Company
 Regulations and Item 1. Business Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations. 

While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains
 may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.

To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our
 stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read written disclosure carefully
 and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.

A return of capital is a return of a portion of your original investment in shares of our common stock. As a result, a return of capital will (i) lower your tax basis in your shares and thereby increase
 the amount of capital gain (or decrease the amount of capital loss) realized upon a subsequent sale or redemption of such shares and (ii) reduce the amount of funds we have for investment in portfolio companies. We have not established any limit on
 the extent to which we may use offering proceeds to fund distributions. However, our Board of Directors, including a majority of our independent directors, will be required to determine that making return of capital distributions from our offering
 proceeds is in the best interests of our stockholders based upon our then-current financial condition and our expected future growth prospects.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan DRIP for our stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in
 additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of our common stock generally are subject to
 the same U.S. federal income tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued the following shares of common stock under the DRIP:

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of political tensions in the United States and around the world (including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war) have introduced significant
 volatility in the financial markets, and the effect of the volatility could materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.

Valuation Risk

Our investments may not have readily available market quotations (as such term is defined in Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act), and those investments which do not have readily available market quotations
 are valued at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific
 facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a
 readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period, including as a result of the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the economy and financial and capital markets. Because of the inherent uncertainty
 of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate sensitivity and risk refer to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. To the extent that we borrow money to make investments, including under
 any credit facility, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of borrowing funds would increase,
 which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.

As of September 30, 2024, 75.6 of our debt investments based on outstanding principal balance represented floating-rate investments based on PRIME
 and approximately 24.4 of our debt investments based on outstanding principal balance represented fixed rate investments. As of December 31, 2023, 84.1 of our debt
 investments based on outstanding principal balance represented floating-rate investments based on PRIME and approximately 15.9 of our debt investments based on outstanding principal balance represented fixed rate investments.
