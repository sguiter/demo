At the time of acquisition, the Company estimates
the fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets based upon the facts and circumstances related to the particular intangible
asset. Inherent in such estimates are judgments and estimates of future revenue, profitability, cash flows and appropriate discount rates
for any present value calculations. The Company preliminarily estimates the value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets and then
finalizes the estimated fair values during the purchase allocation period, which does not extend beyond months from the date of acquisition.
The Company s amortization expense for acquired identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives was for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Estimated amortization expense for acquired identifiable intangible assets for fiscal year 2024

.0 million for nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and accumulated deficit
of approximately 146.8 million through September 30, 2024. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company s
net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million. Additionally, the Company s current liabilities exceed
its current assets, and it has a working capital deficit. 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company
sustained a net loss of approximately .0 million and used cash in operating activities of million, which excludes non-cash charges
and financing activities. To date the Company has generated cash flows from issuances of equity and indebtedness. 

The Company received approximately million from
the issuance of debt for the nine months ending September 30, 2024. This event served to ensure liquidity of the business through September
30, 2024. 

Management s plans in regard to these matters
include actions to sustain the Company s operations, such as seeking additional funding to meet its obligations and implement its
business plan. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in implementing its plans or in raising additional funds.
If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it may be forced to delay, reduce,
or cease its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, adjustments would be
necessary to the carrying values of its assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses could be materially affected.

The following discussion and analysis should be read
in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements (unaudited) and Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (unaudited) filed herewith. 

Business Overview 

Splash Beverage Group, Inc. (the Company ,
 Splash seeks to identify, acquire, and build early stage or under-valued beverage brands that have strong growth potential
within its distribution system. Splash s distribution system is comprehensive in the US and is now expanding to select attractive
international markets. Through its division Qplash, Splash s distribution reach includes e-commerce access to both business-to-business
(B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) customers. Qplash markets well known beverage brands to customers throughout the US that prefer delivery
direct to their office, facilities; and or homes. 

Results of Operations
for the Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue 

Revenues for the three months ended September 30,
2024 were approximately 1 million compared to revenues of approximately 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Part
of the 4.1 million decrease in sales is due to a decrease in our beverage sales of 0.2 million. Additionally, revenues from our vertically
integrated B2B and B2C e-commerce distribution platform called Qplash decreased approximately 3.9 million or 97.6 due to low inventory.
Total sales declined due to limited liquidity to procure inventory to drive third-party sales. 

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.6 million compared
to revenues of 16.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 12.6 million decrease in sales is driven by decreases
in both the e-commerce and beverage businesses which decreased 11.6 million and 1 million respectively. Qplash s revenue decreased
due to low inventory. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 0.7 million compared to cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 3.8 million. The 3.1 million
decrease in cost of goods sold for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven by decreased sales. 

20 

Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 2.9 million compared to cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 11.3 million. The 8.5 million
decrease in cost of goods sold for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven by decreased sales in both the e-commerce
and beverage business. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 3.0 million compared to 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 a decrease of 2.6 million. The decrease
in operating expenses was primarily due to a reduction in marketing expense, freight cost, Amazon selling fees and the non-cash expenses. 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 10.3 million compared to 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 a decrease of 6.5 million. The decrease
in operating expenses was primarily due to marketing expense, contracted services, freight cost and Amazon selling fees partially offset
by increases for the non-cash expenses. 

The net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 4.7 million as compared to a net loss of approximately 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
in net loss is due to lower debt discount expense. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.7 million as compared
to a net loss of approximately 15.0 million for the nine months September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss is due to lower operating
expenses partially offset by higher interest expenses. 

Net Other Income and Expense 

Interest expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 0.9 million compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.7 million increase in interest
expense is due to new loans with a principal of 3.2 million. Interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.0
million compared to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.4 million increase in interest expense is due to
new loans with a principal of 7.9 million with higher interest rates. 

There were no significant other expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 respectively. Other expenses were 0 and other income was 0.05 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 respectively. The income in 2023 was related to an insurance
settlement. 

Amortization of debt discount for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.8 million compared to 1.1 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization
of debt discount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.7 million compared to 2.5 million for nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY, GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors
in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total cash
and cash equivalents of 456,889, as compared with 379,978 at December 31, 2023. 

Net cash used for operating activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.4 million as compared to the net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 of 8.5 million. The primary reasons for the change in net cash used were reduced operating expenses, prepaid expenses
were allocated. 

Net cash used for investing activities for the period
ending September 30, 2024, 1,500 furniture was returned to vendor and 4,735 on purchase of machinery. For the period September 30, 2023,
the Company had leasehold improvements of 12,613 related to our Copa Di Vino production site. 

21 

Net cash provided by financing activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.4 million compared to 4.4 million provided from financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 7.9 million for convertible note, which
was offset by repayments to debt holders of 1.5 million and 0.01 million to related party cash advance. 

In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations,
the Company will need to raise additional equity or debt capital. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when
needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. The Company will be required to pursue
sources of additional capital through various means, including debt or equity financings. Future financings through equity investments
are likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities the Company may issue in future capital transactions
may be more favorable for new investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, the issuance of warrants
or other derivative securities, and the issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have additional
dilutive effects. Further, the Company may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking
fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. The Company may also be required to recognize non-cash
expenses in connection with certain securities the Company may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact
our financial condition. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets and our history
of losses, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. If the amount of capital the Company are able to raise from
financing activities together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent that
the Company reduce our operations accordingly, the Company may be required to curtail or cease operations. As a result, there is uncertainty
regarding the Company s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt
as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of the consolidated financial
statements being available to be issued. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

Minimum Royalty Payments: 

The Company has a licensing agreement with ABG TapouT,
LLC TapouT ). Under the licensing agreement, the Company has minimum royalty payments to TapouT of 55,000 per month, 495,000
was reserved in the nine months of September 2024. 

Inventory Purchase Commitments : 

None. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
(as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our
financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

22 

Revenue 

The Company
faces significant judgment in revenue recognition due to the complexities of the beverage industry s competitive landscape and diverse
distribution channels. Determining the timing of revenue recognition involves assessing factors such as control transfer, returns, allowances,
trade promotions, and distributor sell-through data. Historical analysis, market trends assessment, and contractual term evaluations inform
revenue recognition judgments. However, inherent uncertainties persist, underscoring the critical nature of revenue recognition as it
significantly impacts financial statements and performance evaluation. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The allowance for doubtful
accounts is established based on historical experience, current economic conditions, and specific customer collection issues. Management
evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and adjusts the allowance as necessary. Changes in economic conditions
or customer creditworthiness could result in adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impacting our reported financial results. 

Inventory Valuation 

We value inventory at the
lower of cost or net realizable value. Estimating the net realizable value of inventory involves significant judgment, particularly when
market conditions change rapidly or when excess or obsolete inventory exists. Management regularly assesses inventory quantities on hand,
future demand forecasts, and market conditions to determine whether write-downs to inventory are necessary. 

Fair Value Measurements 

We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a
recurring basis. Fair value measurements involve significant judgment and estimation, particularly when observable inputs are limited
or not available. Management utilizes valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models, market comparable, and third-party appraisals
to determine fair values. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not required for Smaller
Reporting Companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the
participation of the principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange
Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses
in our internal controls over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30 ,
2024. The material weaknesses relate to a lack of segregation of duties between accounting and other functions and the absence of sufficient
depth of in-house accounting personnel with the ability to properly account for complex transactions. 

The Company plans to
implement additional internal controls or enhance existing internal controls to strengthen its control environment . Subsequent
to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the company is reviewing a plan to engage additional internal staff, external staff, or
an advisory firm to provide support on technical issues related to U.S. GAAP as related to the maintenance of our accounting books and
records and the preparation of our financial statements. 

Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Except with respect to the
above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

23 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time
to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
Except for the litigation disclosed below, we are not currently a party to any legal or arbitration proceeding the outcome of which, if
 determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. 

On August 14, 2024, TapouT, LLC,
a subsidiary of Authentic Brands Group, LLC ABG ), filed a Complaint (the Complaint against the Company in
the Supreme Count of New York for New York County (the Court ). The Complaint pertains to breach of a certain licensing agreement
dated December 8, 2011 (the Licensing Agreement ), under which the Company became a successor in interest on July 1, 2013,
pursuant to an amendment to the Licensing Agreement. 

ABG alleges that as a result of an unpaid invoice they had exercised their
right pursuant to section 22 of the Licensing Agreement to terminate the Licensing Agreement. ABG alleges that as a result of the aforementioned
termination, pursuant to the Licensing Agreement, they are owed all unpaid fees and other amounts payable become immediately due. As a
result, ABG have brought two causes of action, the first being breach of contract for the unpaid invoice and the second for accounts stated
for all unpaid fees and other amounts payable. TapouT, LLC is seeking 1,400,000 for termination of the Licensing
A greement. The Company (Splash Beverage Group) does not view this as a reasonable amount given that
the Company believes TapOut LLC did not fulfill their obligations
pursuant the L icensing A greement.
 The Company believes the case will be settled for a lower amount and has booked a legal reserve of 330,000 as the estimate for
the potential liability. 

On November
12, 2024, the Company filed a motion to compel mediation that is pending before the Court. 

The Company intends to take all necessary steps to continue to vigorously
defend against the action.
