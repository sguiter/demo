COAST ULTRA DEEP ROYALTY TRUST 

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

1.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
financial statements of Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust (the Royalty Trust) are prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting
and are not intended to present the Royalty Trust s financial position and results of operations in conformity with United States
(U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This other comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting permitted
for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial
Statements of Royalty Trusts . 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include
all required information and disclosures. Therefore, this information should be read in conjunction with the Royalty Trust s
financial statements and notes contained in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form
10-K). The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A. (the Trustee), necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods reported. All such adjustments
are, in the opinion of the Trustee, of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the three- and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2024. 

The
Royalty Trust was created to hold a 5 percent gross overriding royalty interest (collectively, the overriding royalty interests) in future
production from specified Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous exploration prospects, located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico
and onshore in South Louisiana that existed as of December 5, 2012 (collectively, the subject interests). 

Royalties
are recorded in royalty income on the statements of distributable income when received under the modified cash basis of accounting. Significant
accounting policies are consistent with Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

The
Royalty Trust evaluates the carrying values of the overriding royalty interests in the subject interests for impairment if conditions
indicate that potential uncertainty exists regarding the Royalty Trust s ability to recover its recorded amounts related to the
overriding royalty interests. Indications of potential impairment with respect to the overriding royalty interests can include, among
other things, subject interest lease expirations, reductions in estimated reserve quantities or resource potential, changes in estimated
future oil and natural gas prices, exploration costs, and/or drilling plans, and other matters that arise that could negatively impact
the carrying values of the overriding royalty interests. If an impairment event occurs and it is determined that the carrying value of
the Royalty Trust s overriding royalty interests in the subject interests may not be recoverable, an impairment will be recognized
as measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the overriding royalty interests in the subject interests exceeds the fair
value of these assets, which would be measured by discounting projected cash flows. The related impairment amounts are recorded as a
reduction to the overriding royalty interest with an offsetting reduction to the Trust Corpus in the period such impairment is determined.
Impairment of the carrying values of the overriding royalty interests in the subject interests involves a significant amount of judgment
and may be subject to changes over time based on drilling plans and results, geophysical evaluations, the assignment of proved natural
gas reserves, availability of capital and other factors. Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). When indicators of impairment
are present and it is determined that the carrying value of the Royalty Trust s overriding royalty interests in the subject interests
exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the subject interest, fair value estimates utilized in the impairment assessment are
determined based on inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements.

2.
OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTERESTS 

The
onshore Highlander subject interest is the only subject interest in which the Royalty Trust holds an overriding royalty interest. Amortization
charges related to production volumes associated with the onshore Highlander subject interest reduced the carrying value of the overriding
royalty interests by 0 and 21,780 during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Highlander
Oil Gas Assets LLC (HOGA) has a 72 percent working interest and an approximate 48 percent net revenue interest in the onshore Highlander
subject interest. The Royalty Trust holds a 3.6 percent overriding royalty interest in the onshore Highlander subject interest. HOGA
is the operator of the onshore Highlander subject interest. 

As
previously disclosed, the sole well producing from the onshore Highlander subject interest experienced an operational issue on January
19, 2023, resulting in substantial amounts of water entering the well, which caused a shut in of the well before production resumed at
significantly reduced levels. Following an evaluation by HOGA s field operations team, HOGA determined that it would be necessary
to commence operations to control the water production, in expectation of eventually initiating kill operations on the
well. HOGA has informed the Trustee that the well was shut in effective March 31, 2023 and production from the well has ceased, with
the well having flowed intermittently but not on a continuous basis from that time. HOGA has informed the Trustee that due to the underground
flow of fluids into the wellbore, the well cannot be salvaged and must be plugged and abandoned. On March 7, 2024, HOGA notified the
Trustee that operations have begun to permanently plug and abandon the sole well producing from the onshore Highlander subject interest.
Abandoning the well eliminated any production from the onshore Highlander subject interest, which also eliminated any proceeds to which
the Royalty Trust would be entitled pursuant to its overriding royalty interests. Unless another well is drilled on the onshore Highlander
subject interest, the Royalty Trust does not expect to receive any income attributable to its overriding royalty interests and accordingly,
does not expect to have any cash available to distribute to Royalty Trust unitholders in future periods. 

The
Royalty Trust fully impaired the carrying value of the onshore Highlander subject interest by 308,071 during the quarter ended March
31, 2023. Unless a new well is drilled on the onshore Highlander subject interest, the Royalty Trust does not expect to receive any income
attributable to its overriding royalty interests. Therefore, the Royalty Trust recognized the remaining carrying value of the onshore
Highlander subject interest as of March 31, 2023 as an impairment loss. Accumulated amortization was 6,756,701 at September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023. 

3.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

Royalty
Income. In accordance with the terms of the master conveyance, royalties are paid to the Royalty Trust on the last day of the month
following the month in which production payments are received by HOGA. The Royalty Trust did not receive royalties during the three- and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Royalty Trust received royalties
of 401,278 during the three-month period ended September 30 2023. Royalties received by the Royalty Trust must first be used to (i)
satisfy Royalty Trust administrative expenses and (ii) reduce Royalty Trust indebtedness. The Royalty Trust had no indebtedness outstanding
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Each
quarter, the Trustee will determine the amount of funds available for distribution to the Royalty Trust unitholders. Available funds
will equal the excess cash received by the Royalty Trust from the royalty interests and other sources during that quarter over the Royalty
Trust s liabilities for that quarter. Available funds will be reduced by any cash the Trustee reserves against future liabilities.
As of September 30, 2024, the Trustee has established a minimum cash reserve of 302,500. The minimum cash reserve is not reflective
of the Royalty Trust s operating cash balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

7 

Commencing
with the distribution to unitholders in the first quarter of 2022, the Royalty Trust withheld 8,750 from the funds otherwise available
for distribution each quarter through the first quarter of 2023, with the intent of gradually building a cash reserve of approximately
 350,000. As no proceeds were available for distribution in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Royalty Trust
did not withhold any funds for the cash reserve. Unless a new well is drilled on the onshore Highlander subject interest as discussed
in Note 2 above, the Royalty Trust does not intend to withhold funds for the cash reserve in the future, as the Royalty Trust does not
expect to have any cash available to distribute to unitholders in future periods. This cash is reserved for the payment of future known,
anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities of the Royalty Trust. The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted cash reserve
amount at any time and may increase or decrease the rate at which it withholds funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance
notice to the unitholders. Cash held in reserve will be invested as required by the amended and restated royalty trust agreement governing
the Royalty Trust (the royalty trust agreement). Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary to pay or provide for the payment
of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to unitholders, together with interest
earned on the funds. For additional information regarding distributions to Royalty Trust unitholders, see Note 4. 

Funding
of Administrative Expenses. Pursuant to the royalty trust agreement, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) has agreed to pay annual trust expenses
up to a maximum amount of 350,000, with no right of repayment or interest due, to the extent the Royalty Trust lacks sufficient funds
to pay administrative expenses. On February 1, 2024, pursuant to this provision, FCX contributed approximately 166,000 for the payment
of trust expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023, and contributed the maximum of 350,000 for the payment of trust
expenses incurred during the year ending December 31, 2024. In addition to such annual contributions, FCX has agreed to lend money, on
an unsecured, interest-free basis, to the Royalty Trust to fund the Royalty Trust s ordinary administrative expenses as set forth
in the royalty trust agreement. All funds the Trustee borrows to cover expenses or liabilities, whether from FCX or from any other source,
must be repaid before the Royalty Trust unitholders will receive any distributions. No loans or repayments were made during the quarters
ended September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and no loans were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Pursuant
to the royalty trust agreement, FCX agreed to provide and maintain a 1.0 million stand-by reserve account or an equivalent letter of
credit for the benefit of the Royalty Trust to enable the Trustee to draw on such reserve account or letter of credit to pay obligations
of the Royalty Trust if its funds are inadequate to pay its obligations at any time. Currently, with the consent of the Trustee, FCX
may reduce the reserve account or substitute a letter of credit with a different face amount for the original letter of credit or any
substitute letter of credit. In connection with this arrangement, FCX provided 1.0 million to the Royalty Trust. The 1.0 million, plus
interest collected thereon, is reflected as reserve fund cash, with a corresponding reserve fund liability in the accompanying Statements
of Assets, Liabilities and Trust Corpus. During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Royalty Trust used 84,282
and 100,382, respectively, from the reserve account to pay administrative expenses to the Trustee, which is included in the administrative
expenses in the accompanying Statements of Distributable Income. As of September 30, 2024, FCX had not requested a reduction of the reserve
account. 

Administration.
 HOGA performs all administrative and reporting responsibilities with respect to the Royalty Trust, including those described in Article
III of the royalty trust agreement. 

Compensation
of the Trustee. The Trustee receives annual compensation of 200,000. Additionally, the Trustee receives reimbursement for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the Royalty Trust. The Trustee s compensation is paid
out of the Royalty Trust s assets. The Trustee has a lien on the Royalty Trust s assets to secure payment of its compensation
and any indemnification expenses and other amounts to which it is entitled under the royalty trust agreement.

OVERVIEW 

You
should read the following discussion in conjunction with the financial statements of Gulf Coast Ultra Deep Royalty Trust (the Royalty
Trust) and the related Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the discussion of
its Business and Properties in the Royalty Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K),
filed with the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The results of operations reported and summarized below
are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Unless otherwise specified, all references to Notes refer to
the Notes to Financial Statements located in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. Also see the 2023
Form 10-K for a glossary of definitions for some of the oil and gas industry terms used in this Form 10-Q. Additionally, please refer
to the section entitled Cautionary Statement on page 14 of this Form 10-Q. The information below has been furnished
to the Trustee by Highlander Oil Gas Assets LLC (HOGA). 

Business
Overview 

On
June 3, 2013, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) and McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR) completed the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 5, 2012 (the merger agreement), by and among MMR, FCX, and INAVN Corp., a Delaware corporation
and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX (Merger Sub). Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into MMR, with
MMR surviving the merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FCX (the merger). 

FCX s
oil and gas assets are held through its wholly owned subsidiary, FCX Oil Gas LLC (FM O G). As a result of the merger, MMR and
McMoRan Oil Gas LLC (McMoRan) are both indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of FM O G. 

The
Royalty Trust is a statutory trust created as contemplated by the merger agreement by FCX under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant
to a trust agreement entered into on December 18, 2012 (inception), by and among FCX, as depositor, Wilmington Trust, National Association,
as Delaware trustee, and certain officers of FCX, as regular trustees. On May 29, 2013, Wilmington Trust, National Association, was replaced
by BNY Trust of Delaware, as Delaware trustee (the Delaware Trustee), through an action of the depositor. Effective June 3, 2013, the
regular trustees were replaced by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the Trustee). 

The
Royalty Trust was created to hold a 5 gross overriding royalty interest (collectively, the overriding royalty interests) in future production
from specified Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous exploration prospects located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore
in South Louisiana that existed as of December 5, 2012, the date of the merger agreement (collectively, the subject interests). The subject
interests were carved out of the mineral interests that were acquired by FCX pursuant to the merger and were not considered
part of FCX s purchase consideration of MMR. McMoRan has informed the Trustee that it has no plans to pursue, has relinquished,
has allowed to expire or has sold all of its subject interests. 

In
connection with the merger, on June 3, 2013, (1) FCX, as depositor, McMoRan, as grantor, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee entered
into the amended and restated royalty trust agreement to govern the Royalty Trust and the respective rights and obligations of FCX, the
Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, and the Royalty Trust unitholders with respect to the Royalty Trust (the royalty trust agreement); and
(2) McMoRan, as grantor, and the Royalty Trust, as grantee, entered into the master conveyance of overriding royalty interests (the master
conveyance) pursuant to which McMoRan conveyed to the Royalty Trust the overriding royalty interests in future production from the subject
interests. Other than (a) its formation, (b) its receipt of contributions and loans from FCX for administrative and other expenses as
provided for in the royalty trust agreement, (c) its payment of such administrative and other expenses, (d) its repayment of loans from
FCX, (e) its receipt of the conveyance of the overriding royalty interests from McMoRan pursuant to the master conveyance, (f) its receipt
of royalties from McMoRan and HOGA, and (g) its cash distributions to Royalty Trust unitholders, if any, the Royalty Trust has not conducted
any activities. The Trustee has no involvement with, control over, or responsibility for, any aspect of any operations on or relating
to the subject interests. 

10 

The
Trustee receives annual compensation of 200,000. Additionally, the Trustee receives reimbursement for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the administration of the Royalty Trust. The Trustee s compensation is paid out of the Royalty Trust s
assets. The Trustee has a lien on the Royalty Trust s assets to secure payment of its compensation and any indemnification expenses
and other amounts to which it is entitled under the royalty trust agreement.

February 5, 2019, McMoRan completed the sale of all of its rights, title and interest in and to the onshore Highlander subject interest
pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement with HOGA (the Highlander Sale). The onshore Highlander subject interest was sold subject to
the overriding royalty interest in future production held by the Royalty Trust. As a result of the Highlander Sale, HOGA has a 72 percent
working interest and an approximate 48 percent net revenue interest in the onshore Highlander subject interest. The Royalty Trust continues
to hold a 3.6 percent overriding royalty interest in the onshore Highlander subject interest. HOGA is the operator of the onshore Highlander
subject interest. McMoRan has informed the Trustee that it has no plans to pursue, has relinquished, has allowed to expire or has sold
all of its subject interests. 

In
connection with the Highlander Sale, McMoRan sold its interests in substantially all of its oil and gas leases associated with the Highlander
subject interest to HOGA. As of September 30, 2024, the onshore Highlander subject interest had no production, as HOGA had commenced operations to permanently plug and abandon the well
in early March 2024, and all the previously
owned leases associated with the Highlander subject interest in South Louisiana have terminated due to lack of production associated
with the acreage. Whether or not HOGA renews any of the acreage associated with the onshore Highlander subject interest is determined
by HOGA s current and future plans and other outside factors, over which the Royalty Trust has no control. 

Status
of the Onshore Highlander Subject Interest 

As
previously disclosed, the sole well producing from the onshore Highlander subject interest experienced an operational issue on January
19, 2023, resulting in substantial amounts of water entering the well, which caused a shut in of the well before production resumed at
significantly reduced levels. Following an evaluation by HOGA s field operations team, HOGA determined that it would be necessary
to commence operations to control the water production, in expectation of eventually initiating kill operations on the
well. HOGA has informed the Trustee that the well was shut in effective March 31, 2023 and production from the well has ceased, with
the well having flowed intermittently but not on a continuous basis from that time. HOGA has informed the Trustee that due to the underground
flow of fluids into the wellbore, the well cannot be salvaged and must be plugged and abandoned. Abandoning the well eliminated any production
from the onshore Highlander subject interest, which also eliminated any proceeds to which the Royalty Trust would be entitled pursuant
to its overriding royalty interests. Unless a new well is drilled on the onshore Highlander subject interest, the Royalty Trust does
not expect to receive any income attributable to its overriding royalty interests and accordingly, does not expect to have any cash available
to distribute to Royalty Trust unitholders in future periods. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Pursuant
to the royalty trust agreement, FCX has agreed to pay annual trust expenses up to a maximum amount of 350,000, with no right of repayment
or interest due, to the extent the Royalty Trust lacks sufficient funds to pay administrative expenses. On February 1, 2024, pursuant
to this provision, FCX contributed approximately 166,000 for the payment of trust expenses incurred during the year ended December 31,
2023, and contributed the maximum of 350,000 for the payment of trust expenses incurred during the year ending December 31, 2024. In
addition to such annual contributions, FCX has agreed to lend money, on an unsecured, interest-free basis, to the Royalty Trust to fund
the Royalty Trust s ordinary administrative expenses as set forth in the royalty trust agreement. All funds the Trustee borrows
to cover expenses or liabilities, whether from FCX or from any other source, must be repaid before the Royalty Trust unitholders will
receive any distributions. No loans or repayments were made during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and no
loans were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Trustee requested a loan from FCX in the amount of 200,000
on October 16, 2024. FCX funded the loan request with a check dated November 6, 2024. 

11 

Pursuant
to the royalty trust agreement, FCX agreed to provide and maintain a 1.0 million stand-by reserve account or an equivalent letter of
credit for the benefit of the Royalty Trust to enable the Trustee to draw on such reserve account or letter of credit to pay obligations
of the Royalty Trust if its funds are inadequate to pay its obligations at any time. Currently, with the consent of the Trustee, FCX
may reduce the reserve account or substitute a letter of credit with a different face amount for the original letter of credit or any
substitute letter of credit. In connection with this arrangement, FCX provided 1.0 million to the Royalty Trust. The 1.0 million, plus
interest collected thereon, is reflected as reserve fund cash, with a corresponding reserve fund liability in the accompanying Statements
of Assets, Liabilities and Trust Corpus. During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Royalty Trust used 84,282
and 100,382, respectively, 2024 from the reserve account to pay administrative expenses to the Trustee, which is included in the administrative
expenses in the accompanying Statements of Distributable Income. As of September 30, 2024, FCX had not requested a reduction of the reserve
account. 

In
connection with the completion of the Highlander Sale, HOGA assumed all administrative and reporting responsibilities with respect to
the Royalty Trust, including those described in Article III of the royalty trust agreement. 

In
accordance with the terms of the master conveyance, royalties are paid to the Royalty Trust on the last day of the month following
the month in which production payments are received by HOGA. The Royalty Trust did not receive royalties during the three- and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Royalty Trust received royalties of 401,278 during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. 

Royalties
received by the Royalty Trust must first be used to (i) satisfy Royalty Trust administrative expenses and (ii) reduce Royalty Trust indebtedness.
The Royalty Trust had no indebtedness outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Each
quarter, the Trustee will determine the amount of funds available for distribution to the Royalty Trust unitholders. Available funds
will equal the excess cash received by the Royalty Trust from the royalty interests and other sources during that quarter over the Royalty
Trust s liabilities for that quarter. Available funds will be reduced by any cash the Trustee decides to hold as a reserve against
future liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Trustee has established a minimum cash reserve of 302,500. The minimum cash reserve
is not reflective of the Royalty Trust s operating cash balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Commencing
with the distribution to unitholders in the first quarter of 2022, the Royalty Trust withheld 8,750 from the funds otherwise available
for distribution each quarter through the first quarter of 2023, with the intent of gradually building a cash reserve of approximately
 350,000. As no proceeds were available for distribution in the third quarter of 2024, the Royalty Trust did not withhold any funds for
the cash reserve. Unless another well is drilled on the onshore Highlander subject interest as discussion Overview Status
of the Onshore Highlander Subject Interest above, the Royalty Trust does not intend to withhold funds for the cash reserve as
the Royalty Trust does not expect to have any cash available to distribute to unitholders in future periods. This cash is reserved for
the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities of the Royalty Trust. The Trustee may increase or decrease
the targeted cash reserve amount at any time and may increase or decrease the rate at which it is withholding funds to build the cash
reserve at any time, without advance notice to the unitholders. Cash held in reserve will be invested as required by the royalty trust
agreement. Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary to pay or provide for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent
expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to unitholders, together with interest earned on the funds. 

12 

There
was no distributable income during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Any distribution in a particular period
is not necessarily indicative of future distributions. As previously disclosed, the sole well producing from the onshore Highlander subject
interest experienced an operational issue on January 19, 2023, resulting in substantial amounts of water entering the well, which caused
a shut in of the well before production resumed at significantly reduced levels. Following an evaluation by HOGA s field operations
team, HOGA determined that it would be necessary to commence operations to control the water production, in expectation of eventually
initiating kill operations on the well. HOGA informed the Trustee that the well was shut in effective March 31, 2023 and
production from the well has ceased with the well having flowed intermittently but not on a continuous basis from that time. In October
2023, HOGA informed the Trustee that due to the underground flow of fluids into the wellbore, the well cannot be salvaged and must be
plugged and abandoned. HOGA subsequently informed the Trustee that operations to permanently plug and abandon the well commenced in early
March 2024. The onshore Highlander subject interest is the only subject interest that has established commercial production. Abandoning
the well eliminated any production from the onshore Highlander subject interest, which also eliminated any proceeds to which the Royalty
Trust would be entitled pursuant to its overriding royalty interests during the same period. Unless another well is drilled on the onshore
Highlander subject interest, the Royalty Trust does not expect to receive any income attributable to its overriding royalty interests
and accordingly, does not expect to have any cash available to distribute to Royalty Trust unitholders in future periods. 

The
Royalty Trust s only other sources of liquidity are mandatory annual contributions, any loans and the required standby reserve
account or letter of credit from FCX. As a result, any material adverse change in FCX s, McMoRan s or HOGA s financial
condition or results of operations could materially and adversely affect the Royalty Trust and the underlying royalty trust units. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The
Royalty Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements. The Royalty Trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party, nor does the Royalty
Trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt, losses or
contingent obligations. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Royalty
Income. In accordance with the terms of the master conveyance, during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Royalty Trust did not receive royalty income. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Royalty Trust did not receive
royalty income. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Royalty Trust received royalties of 401,278 related to 101,352
Mcf of natural gas production attributable to the onshore Highlander subject interest with average post-production costs of 0.67 per
Mcf and an average sales price of 4.63 per Mcf. 

Royalty
income was lower during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding 2023 periods, primarily
due to lower production resulting from the operational issues relating to the sole well producing from the Highlander subject interest
and ultimately the shutting in of the well. 

Administrative
Expenses. Administrative expenses consist primarily of audit, legal and trustee expenses incurred in connection with the administration
of the Royalty Trust. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Royalty Trust paid administrative expenses
of 84,282 and 108,432, respectively. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Royalty Trust paid administrative
expenses of 662,047 and 469,822, respectively. Administrative expenses were higher for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to the corresponding 2023 period, primarily due to the Trust s payment of fourth quarter 2023 administrative expenses
in the first quarter of 2024.

STATEMENT

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward-looking statements are all statements
other than statements of historical facts, such as any statements regarding the future financial condition of the Royalty Trust or the
trading market for the royalty trust units, all statements regarding the respective plans of McMoRan or HOGA for the subject interests,
the potential results of any drilling on the subject interests by the applicable operator, anticipated interests of McMoRan or HOGA and

of the nature or potential of the subject interests. The words anticipates, may, can, plans, 
 believes, estimates, expects, projects, intends, likely, 
 will, should, to be, potential, and any similar expressions and/or statements
that are not historical facts are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees or assurances of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected
or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated
by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the future plans of FCX and HOGA for their remaining oil and gas properties;
the risk that the subject interests will not produce additional hydrocarbons; general economic and business conditions; variations in
the market demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas; drilling results; changes in oil and natural gas reserve expectations; the
potential adoption of new governmental regulations; decisions by FCX, McMoRan or HOGA not to develop and/or transfer the subject interests;
any inability of FCX, McMoRan or HOGA to develop the subject interests; damages to facilities resulting from natural disasters or accidents;
fluctuations in the market price, volume and frequency of the trading market for the royalty trust units; the amount of cash received
or expected to be received by the Trustee from the underlying subject interests on or prior to a record date for a quarterly cash distributions;
the cost and timing of drilling a new well on the Highlander subject interest; and other factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk
Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K, as updated by the Royalty Trust s subsequent filings with the SEC. Any differences in actual
cash receipts by the Royalty Trust could affect the amount of quarterly cash distributions. 

Investors
are cautioned that current production rates may not be indicative of future production rates or of the amounts of hydrocarbons that a
well may produce, and that many of the assumptions upon which forward-looking statements are based are likely to change after such forward-looking
statements are made, which the Royalty Trust cannot control. The Royalty Trust cautions investors that it does not intend to update its
forward-looking statements, notwithstanding any changes in assumptions, changes in business plans, actual experience, or other changes,
and the Royalty Trust undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures . 

(a)
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . The Royalty Trust has no employees, and, therefore, does not have a principal
executive officer or principal financial officer. Accordingly, the Trustee is responsible for making the evaluations, assessments and
conclusions required pursuant to this Item 4. The Trustee has evaluated the effectiveness of the Royalty Trust s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered
by this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Trustee has concluded that the Royalty Trust s disclosure controls and procedures
are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. 

Due
to the nature of the Royalty Trust as a passive entity and in light of the contractual arrangements pursuant to which the Royalty Trust
was created, including the provisions of (i) the amended and restated royalty trust agreement and (ii) the master conveyance, the Royalty
Trust s disclosure controls and procedures necessarily rely on (A) information provided by FCX or HOGA, including information relating
to results of operations, the costs and revenues attributable to the subject interests and other operating and historical data, plans
for future operating and capital expenditures, reserve information, information relating to projected production, and other information
relating to the status and results of operations of the subject interests and the overriding royalty interests, and (B) conclusions and
reports regarding reserves by the Royalty Trust s independent reserve engineers. 

(b)
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting . During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there has been no change in
the Royalty Trust s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Royalty Trust s internal control over financial reporting. The Trustee notes for purposes of clarification that it
has no authority over, and makes no statement concerning, the internal control over financial reporting of FCX or HOGA.
