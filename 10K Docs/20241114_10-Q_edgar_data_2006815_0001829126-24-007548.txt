CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Risk Factors of our Prospectus dated July 31, 2024 and in any subsequent filing we make with the SEC, as well as in any documents incorporated by reference that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. 

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after completion of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

units (the Units ), including Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of (the Public Proceeds (see Note 3). 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the private placement warrant purchase agreement, dated August 8, 2024, between the Company and Voyager Acquisition Sponsor Holdco LLC, and the private placement warrant purchase agreement, dated August 8, 2024, between the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Odeon Capital Group LLC, the Company completed the private sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of (the Private Proceeds and together with the Public Proceeds, the Offering Proceeds ). In this Private Placement, the Sponsor purchased warrants, while Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Odeon Capital Group LLC purchased warrants. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO (see Note 4). 

Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of of cash underwriting fee, of deferred underwriting fee (see additional discussion in Note 6), and of other offering costs. 

Investments Held in Trust Account 

As of August 12, 2024, upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee and invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earliest of (i) the completion of an initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of public shares if the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of obligation to redeem 100 of public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of public shareholders. 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units (as defined in Note 4), although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The Company will provide its Class A ordinary shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. 

All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the initial Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association ). In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and its guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ), paragraph 10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Accordingly, all of the Public Shares were presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Company s condensed balance sheets. Given that the Public Shares were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of Class A ordinary shares classified as temporary equity were the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The resulting discount to the initial carrying value of temporary equity was accreted upon closing the Initial Public Offering such that the carrying value equals the redemption value on such date. The accretion or remeasurement is recognized as a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. The Public Shares are redeemable and were classified as such on the balance sheets until such date that a redemption event takes place. 

The Company has determined not to consummate any Business Combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation in order to avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if the Company seeks to consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires the Company to have a minimum amount of funds available from the Trust Account upon consummation of such initial Business Combination, its net tangible asset threshold may limit the Company s ability to consummate such initial Business Combination (as the Company may be required to have a lesser number of shares redeemed) and may force the Company to seek third-party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. As a result, the Company may not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and the Company may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. 

Each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of the Founder Shares prior to this Initial Public Offering (the Initial Shareholders agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the Company agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial Business Combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company s Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 or more of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The Company s Sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees will agree not to propose an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide for the redemption of its Public Shares in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering (the Combination Period ), the Company will (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. However, the Company may hold a shareholder vote at any time to amend its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the amount of time it will have to consummate an initial Business Combination (as well as to modify the substance or timing of the obligation to redeem 100 of the public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the time periods described herein or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity). As described herein, the initial shareholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that they will not propose any such amendment unless the Company provides the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of amounts withdrawn to pay our income taxes), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. 

The Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company s Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only 10.05 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.05 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.05 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Liquidity and Capital Sources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of and a working capital surplus of . Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of a Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, as of September 30, 2024, management has determined that due to the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 12, 2024, the Company had sufficient funds for the working capital needs of the Company until a minimum of one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements.

ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were unrecognized tax benefits, and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position. 

There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed financial statements. 

. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

In this Private Placement, the Sponsor purchased warrants, while Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Odeon Capital Group LLC purchased warrants, all at a price of per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of . Each Private Placement Unit entitles the holder thereof to one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant Private Placement Warrants to purchase one Class A ordinary share at per share. 

Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one whole share of Class A ordinary shares at a price of 11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor is added to the proceeds from the Proposed Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. 

The Sponsor and the Company s officers and directors agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Private Placement Warrants until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination. 

for issuance of Class B ordinary shares (the Founder Shares ). The initial shareholders have agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of 750,000 Founder Shares, on a pro rata basis, to the extent that the option to purchase additional units is not exercised in full by the underwriters. 

On February 16, 2024, the Company issued an additional Founder Shares (up to 225,000 shares of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised) for no additional consideration which were retroactively presented on the unaudited condensed financial statements.

On July 19, 2024, the Company forfeited Founder shares for no consideration. This adjustment was made to align with the reduction in the offering size and has been retroactively reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed financial statements. 

The founder shares included an aggregate of up to shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option is not exercised in full, so that the number of founder shares would represent 20 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On August 12, 2024, following the underwriters exercise of the over-allotment option, the shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. As of September 30, 2024, there were Founder Shares issued and outstanding. 

The initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of (A) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (B) the date following the completion of the initial Business Combination on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination, the Founder Shares will be released from the lockup.

These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2024, or the closing of this offering. There were amounts outstanding under the loans as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company s founding team or any of their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. To date, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.

Risks and Uncertainties 

Management is currently evaluating the impact of significant global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia/Ukraine and Israel/Palestine conflicts, on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that these could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or ability to complete a business combination, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

preference shares, par value, with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company s board of directors. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were preference shares issued or outstanding. 

Class A Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue Class A ordinary shares with a par value of per share. Holders of the Company s Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were Class A ordinary shares issued or outstanding excluding shares subject to redemption. 

Class B Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue Class B ordinary shares with a par value of per share. 

A single Class B ordinary share was issued on December 19, 2023, to establish the Company s legal existence upon incorporation. This share has no economic value and was subsequently forfeited. 

On January 11, 2024, the Company received for issuance of Class B ordinary shares (the Founder Shares ). The initial shareholders have agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of 750,000 Founder Shares, on a pro rata basis, to the extent that the option to purchase additional units is not exercised in full by the underwriters. 

On February 16, 2024, the Company issued an additional Founder Shares (up to 225,000 shares of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised) for no additional consideration which were retroactively presented on the unaudited condensed financial statements. 

On May 31, 2024, the
Company issued an additional 
Founder Shares (up to 3,750 shares of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters 
over-allotment option is exercised) for no additional consideration which were retroactively presented on the unaudited condensed
financial statements. 

On July 19, 2024, the Company forfeited Founder shares for no consideration. This adjustment was made to align with the reduction in the offering size and has been retroactively reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed financial statements. 

The Class B ordinary shares included an aggregate of up to shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option is not exercised in full, so that the number of founder shares would represent 20 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On August 12, 2024, following the underwriters exercise of the over-allotment option, the shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were Class B ordinary Shares issued and outstanding. 

Ordinary shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders except as required by law. 

The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in the Proposed Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial Business Combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20 of the sum of all ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of the Proposed Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination. 

Warrants 

At September 30, 2024, there were Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants outstanding and Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2023. 

Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or the Company permits holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under certain circumstances). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

The warrants have an exercise price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustments, and will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. In addition, if (x) the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than 9.20 per ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the completion of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the 10.00 and 18.00 per share redemption trigger prices described below under Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 18.00 and Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 10.00 will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 100 and 180 , respectively, of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. 

Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 18.00: Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the outstanding warrants for redemption (except as described herein with respect to the Private Placement Warrants): 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of 0.01 per warrant; 

upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and 

if, and only if, the last reported sale price of Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (the Reference Value equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted). 

The Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. 

Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 10.00: Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at 0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to an agreed table based on the redemption date and the fair market value of Class A ordinary shares; 

if, and only if, the Reference Value equals or exceeds 10.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like); and 

if the Reference Value is less than 18.00 per share (as adjusted), the Private Placement Warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above. 

The fair market value of Class A ordinary shares for the above purpose shall mean the volume weighted average price of Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. In no event will the warrants be exercisable in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). 

In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature. 

The Company applies ASC 820, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework. ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price, which is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the Company s principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820 generally requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions based on market data and the entity s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are to be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

Level 1 Assets and liabilities with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges. Inputs to the fair value measurement are observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs to the fair value measurement are determined using prices for recently traded assets and liabilities with similar underlying terms, as well as direct or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 

Level 3 Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs, such as estimates, assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists for the assets or liabilities. 

The Company s public and private warrants were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model and were classified within shareholders deficit and will not require remeasurement after issuance. The following table presents the quantitative information regarding market assumptions used in the valuation of the warrants: 

Expected Initial Business Combination Date 

Market price of public stock 

Term (years) 

Exercise price 

Volatility 

Risk-free rate 

The fair value of the public warrants was estimated to be at issuance. The Company issued private warrants at an issuance price of 1.00 per warrant, while the fair value at issuance was estimated to be 0.12 per warrant. Since these private warrants are classified as equity, no further fair value adjustments will be recognized. 

At September 30, 2024, assets held in the Trust
Account were comprised of 145 in cash and 256,095,510 in U.S. Treasury securities. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company did not withdraw any interest income from the Trust Account. 

The following table presents information about
the Company s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and indicates the fair value hierarchy
of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value. The gross holding gains and fair value of held-to-maturity
securities at September 30, 2024 are as follows:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements under this Item regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of Management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our Management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our Management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our Management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Overview 

We are a blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any business combination target, and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the above-mentioned offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

The issuance of additional ordinary shares or preferred shares in a business combination: 

may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of ordinary shares if preferred shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our ordinary shares; 

could cause a change of control if a substantial number of our ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present directors and officers; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, ordinary shares and/or warrants; and 

may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants. 

Similarly, if we issue debt or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

20 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of amounts withdrawn to pay our income taxes and up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period 

On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted the 2024 SPAC Rules, which became effective on July 1, 2024. The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, 

(i) 
 additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions 

(ii) 
 additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; 

(iii) 
 additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions and 

(iv) 
 the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. 

In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto.

Recent Developments 

The IPO registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 8, 2024 . 

On August 8, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 25,300,000 Units, including the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 253,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the sale of the Units, we consummated the private placement Private Placement of 7,665,000 units (the Initial Private Placement Units ). In this Private Placement, the Sponsor purchased 5,037,500 warrants, while Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Odeon Capital Group LLC purchased 2,627,500 warrants, all at a price of 1 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of 7,665,000. Each Private Placement Unit entitles the holder thereof to one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant Private Placement Warrants to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share. 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, an amount of 254,265,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants in the Private Placement was placed in the Trust Account. 

Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception to the reporting date of September 30, 2024 have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for this offering. Following this offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after this offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After this offering, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of this offering. 

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,321,694 and 1,218,846 respectively, with the main source of income being the
 1,830,655 unrealized gain on investments held in Trust Account. Costs incurred during these periods primarily comprised of general and
administrative costs related to the Initial Public Offering. 

Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations 

Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of shares of Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, by the Sponsor and loans from the Sponsor. 

On August 8, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 25,300,000 Units, including the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 253,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the sale of the Units, we consummated the private placement Private Placement of 7,665,000 units (the Initial Private Placement Units ). In this Private Placement, the Sponsor purchased 5,037,500 warrants, while Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Odeon Capital Group LLC purchased 2,627,500 warrants, all at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of 7,665,000. Each Private Placement Unit entitles the holder thereof to one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant Private Placement Warrants to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share. 

22 

Our liquidity needs were satisfied prior to the completion of Initial Public Offering through 25,000 received from the sponsor for the issuance of the founder shares to our sponsor and up to 300,000 in loans from our sponsor under an unsecured promissory note. As of September 30, 2024, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. 

Net proceeds from (1) the sale of the units in Initial Public offering, after deducting offering expenses and other expenses of approximately 1,173,390 and underwriting commissions of 4,400,000 (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of 12,045,000 and (2) the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of 7,665,00 were 255,091,610. Of this amount, 254,265,000, including 12,045,000 in deferred underwriting commissions was deposited into the trust account. The funds in the trust account are invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries. The remaining 826,610 will not be held in the trust account. 

The proceeds held in the Trust Account were initially invested in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. The holding of these assets in this form is intended to be temporary and for the sole purpose of facilitating the intended Business Combination. To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, which risk increases the longer that we hold investments in the Trust Account, we may, at any time, (based on our Management Team s ongoing assessment of all factors related to our potential status under the Investment Company Act) instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash or in an interest bearing demand deposit account at a bank. 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay income taxes, if any. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our taxes. We expect the only taxes payable by us out of the funds in the trust account will be income taxes, if any. To the extent that our ordinary shares or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As of September 30, 2024 the Company had a cash balance of 757,895 held outside the trust account. Additionally, the Company can avail the loan facilities agreed with the sponsor for working capital. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay income taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our income taxes. 

We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial Business Combination. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 

23 

We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately 150,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses in connection with any business combinations; 150,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; 56,500 for Nasdaq continued listing fees; 320,000 of fees pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement for office space, administrative, financial and support services; 400,000 for director and officer s liability insurance; and approximately 1,425,000 for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves net of estimated interest income. 

These amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. 

We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements as we have not conducted any operations to date. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an aggregate of 30,000 per month to the Sponsor or an affiliate thereof for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on August 8, 2024 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. 

The underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 12,045,000 upon the completion of our initial Business Combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgement. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any critical accounting estimates to be disclosed.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 4. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting .

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. For additional risks relating to our operations carefully consider the factors discussed in Risk Factors of our Prospectus dated August 8, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes during fiscal 2024 to the risk factors that were included in the Prospectus. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On August 8, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 25,300,000 Units, including the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 253,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the sale of the Units, we consummated the private placement Private Placement of 7,665,000 units (the Initial Private Placement Units ). In this Private Placement, the Sponsor purchased 5,037,500 warrants, while Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Odeon Capital Group LLC purchased 2,627,500 warrants, all at a price of 1 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of 7,665,000. Each Private Placement Unit entitles the holder thereof to one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant Private Placement Warrants to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share. 

On August 8, 2024, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 25,300,000 Units, including 3,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Public Share, and one-half of one Public Warrant, with each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for 11.50 per share. 

The Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to us of 253,000,000. On August 8, 2024, simultaneously with the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 7,665,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrants, to our Sponsor and Cantor, generating gross proceeds of 7,665,000. Of those 7,665,000 Private Placement Warrants, the Sponsor purchased 5,037,500 Private Placement Warrants and Cantor Fitzgerald Co. and Odeon Capital Group LLC purchased 2,627,500 Private Placement Warrants. 

Following the closing of our Initial Public Offering, a total of 254,265,000 comprised of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (which amount includes 12,045,000 of the underwriters deferred discount) and the Private Placement, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may be invested by the trustee only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time. 

Other than as described above, there has been no material change in the planned use of the proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement as is described in our final prospectus related to our Initial Public Offering. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as described in the IPO Registration Statement
