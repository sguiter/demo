Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Such estimates include revenue
recognition, see Note 2 Revenue Recognition , provisions for credit losses, deferred income tax assets and associated valuation
allowances, deferred revenue, stock-based compensation and fair value of warrants. These estimates generally involve complex issues and
require management to make judgments, involve analysis of historical and future trends that can require extended periods of time to resolve,
and are subject to change from period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ materially from estimates. 

Segment Reporting 

The
Company has operating and reportable segment. Our operations involve similar products and customers worldwide. Revenue earned is
primarily derived from the sale of software titles, which are developed internally or licensed from related parties. Financial information
about our segment and geographic regions is included in Note 3 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .

Based
on our evaluation of the above indicators, for sales arrangements via Microsoft s Xbox Live, Sony s PlayStation Network,
Valve s Steam, Epic Games Store, My Nintendo Store, and our retail distributor, the digital platforms and distributors have discretion
in establishing the price for the specified good or service and the Company has determined it is the agent in the sales transaction to
the end user and therefore the Company reports revenue on a net basis based on the consideration received from the digital storefront.
For sales arrangements via Apple s App Store and the Google Play Store, the Company has discretion in establishing the price for

 Notes

A
financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term
financial instruments, short-term loans, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments
approximate their fair value due to their short maturities or economic substance. The carrying amount of our revolving loan and notes
payable approximates fair value because the interest rates on these instruments approximate the interest rate on debt with similar terms
available to us for a similar duration. The fair value of the Company s promissory note which has a fixed rate for years, then
a floating rate that approximates the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus . The Company considers the carrying amount of the loan
to approximate fair value as the discounted cost in comparison to market rates would not be materially different than the cost to acquire
a loan with similar terms. See Note 16 Equity for the fair value disclosures related
to the Company s convertible notes, and the Company s warrant liability and derivative instruments.
The Company does not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of September

terminated the lease and vacated the premises. The complaint seeks damages in excess of million. Snail Games USA Inc. disputes the
allegations and the amount of damages. The Company has responded to the complaint with an answer and cross-complaint. The cross-complaint
seeks return for the security deposit. The landlord has answered and denied the allegations of the cross-complaint. The Company
intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted. Trial is presently scheduled to commence in May 2025.

In
October 2023, INDIEV has filed for bankruptcy and the Company does not expect to recover its costs from INDIEV. Accordingly, it is uncertain
whether INDIEV would be able to indemnify the Company due to its bankruptcy. At this time, the Company is unable to quantify the magnitude
of the potential loss should the plaintiffs lawsuit succeed and accordingly no accrual for loss has been recorded in the accompanying

Overview 

Our
mission is to provide high-quality entertainment experiences to audiences around the world. We are a leading, global independent developer
and publisher of interactive digital entertainment for consumers around the world. We have built a premier portfolio of premium games
designed for use on a variety of platforms, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. ARK: Survival Evolved has been a top-25
selling game on the Steam platform by gross revenue in each year we released an ARK DLC. Our expertise in technology, in-game
ecosystems and monetization of online multiplayer games has enabled us to assemble a broad portfolio of intellectual property across
multiple media formats and technology platforms. Our flagship franchise from which we generate the substantial majority of our revenues,
 ARK , is a leader within the sandbox survival genre with 93.7 million console and PC installs through September 30, 2024 and repeated
releases within the top-25 selling games on the Steam platform. See below for discussion of key performance metrics and non-GAAP measures.
In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, ARK: Survival Evolved and ARK: Survival Ascended combined for an
average total of 210,000 and 212,000 daily active users DAUs on the Steam and Epic platforms, respectively, as compared
to 231,000 and 249,000 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We define daily active users 
as the number of unique users who play any given game on any given day. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated
88.7 and 86.4 , respectively, of our revenues from the ARK franchise. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
we generated 82.0 and 86.9 , respectively, of our revenues from the ARK franchise. 

Our
dedication to providing audiences with high-quality entertainment experiences utilizing the latest gaming technology has produced strong
user engagement, continued revenue growth, and increased cash flows. Through September 30, 2024, our ARK franchise game has been
played for 3.8 billion hours with an average playing time per user of 162 hours and with the top 21.2 of all players spending over 100
hours in the game, according to data from the Steam platform. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net revenue

Key
Factors Affecting Our Business 

There
are a number of factors that affect the performance of our business, and the comparability of our results from period to period, including: 

Investments
in our content strategy 

We
continuously evaluate and invest in content strategy to improve and innovate our games and features and to develop current technological
platforms. We are currently actively investing in expanding our gaming pipeline as well as developing media and eSports content related
to our gaming intellectual property. We also continue to invest to grow our micro-influencer platform, NOIZ , by attracting new
influencers and brand customers. We have established a new division internally under the Interactive Films brand. This division will
focus on creating content in the Vertical Short segment of the digital entertainment market. 

Growth
of user base 

We
have experienced significant growth in our number of downloads over the last several years. We have sold 48.7 million units between January
1, 2016 and September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1.1 million units compared to 1.2 million in
the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 3.5 million units compared to 3.9
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our video games provide highly engaging, differentiated entertainment experiences
where the combination of challenge and progress drives player engagement, high average player times, and long-term franchise value. The
success of our franchise hinges on our ability to keep our current players engaged while also growing our user base by innovating our
platform and monetizing new offerings. The degree to which gamers are willing to engage with our platform is driven by our ability to
create interactive and unique content that will enhance the game-play experience. We sell DLCs which are supplementary to our master
games and expand the gaming universe to continuously evolve the game and retain players. Our master games are the base versions of a
specific title, for example, ARK: Survival Evolved is our master game and ARK: Genesis is a DLC. 

While
we believe we have a significant opportunity to grow our installed base, we anticipate that our overall user growth rate will fluctuate
over time as we continue to release new master games and companion DLCs. Download rates and user engagement may increase or decrease
based on other factors such as growth in console, PC and mobile games, ability to release content, market effectively and distribute
to users. 

Investments
in our technology platform 

We
are focused on innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain our competitive advantage. We spend a portion of our capital
on our research and development platform to continuously improve our technological offerings and gaming platform. Our proprietary video
game technology includes a versatile game engine, development pipeline tools, advanced rendering technology and advanced server and network
operations. Continued investment in improving the technology behind our existing gaming platforms as well as developing new software
tools for new product offerings is important to maintaining our strategic goals, developer and creator talent, and financial objectives.
For us to continue providing cutting-edge technology to our users and bringing digital interactive entertainment to market, we must also
continue to invest in developmental and creative resources. For our users, we regularly invest in user-friendly features and enhance
user experience in our games and platforms. As our industry moves towards increased use of cloud gaming and gaming as a service technology,
our ability to bring interactive technologies to market will be an increasingly important part of our business. To accompany our entry
into the Vertical Shorts market, we are currently developing a distribution platform. Once launched, users will be able to access the
content on demand. 

29 

Ability
to release content, market effectively through cross media and expand the gaming group 

Establishing
and maintaining a loyal network of players for our premium games is vital for our business and drives revenue growth. To grow and maintain
our player base, we invest in developing new games to attract and engage players, and in providing existing audiences with proven content
in the form of new DLCs. In the near-term, we may increase spending on original content creation with new studios, and on sales and marketing
as a percentage of revenue to grow our player network. The scale of our player base is determined by a number of factors, including our
ability to strengthen player engagement by producing content that players play regularly and our effectiveness in attracting new players,
both of which may in turn affect our financial performance. 

Strategic
relationship with developers, Studio Wildcard Suzhou Snail 

We
have grown and expect to continue to grow our business by collaborating with game studios that we believe can benefit from our team s
decades of experience developing successful games. We have strategic relationships with many developer studios that create original content
for us. The relationships allow for valuable knowledge sharing between Suzhou Snail, a related party, and the developer studios. We enjoy
a long-term relationship with Studio Wildcard, a related party, which develops our ARK franchise. We have an exclusive license
with Studio Wildcard for rights to ARK , and we work with them and our other studio developer partners to provide ongoing support
across numerous aspects of game development. Our financial results may be affected by our relationship with game studios, including Studio
Wildcard, and our ability to create self-developed titles. 

Relationship
with third party distribution platforms 

We
derive nearly all of our revenue from third-party distribution platforms, these include but are not limited to, Xbox Live and Game Pass,
PlayStation Network, Steam, Epic Games Store, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, My Nintendo Store and the Amazon Appstore.
These digital distribution platforms have policies that may impact our reachability to our potential audience, including the discretion
to amend their terms of service, which could affect our current operations and our financial performance. As we expand to new markets,
we anticipate similar relationships with additional distribution partners that could similarly impact our performance. 

Seasonality 

We
experience fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles, variations
in sales of titles developed for particular platforms, market acceptance of our titles, development and promotional activities relating
to the introduction of new titles, releases of expansion packs and DLCs, and to coincide with the global holiday season in the fourth
and first quarters of each year. Seasonality in our revenue also tends to coincide with promotional cycles on platforms, typically on
a quarterly basis. 

Recent Developments 

On
June 27, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq
Stock Market Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last thirty (30) consecutive business days (From May 10, 2024 to June
26, 2024), the bid price for our Class A common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued
inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule ). In accordance
with Nasdaq rules, we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until December 24, 2024 (the Compliance
Date ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the bid price for the Class
A common stock closed at 1.00 or more for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days, the Staff would provide written
notification to the Company that it complied with the Bid Price Rule and the matter will be closed. 

On
October 18, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff notifying the Company that our Class A common stock had closed above 1.00 for
10 consecutive business days, from October 4, 2024, to October 17, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with the
Bid Price Rule (Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)) and this matter is now closed.

Key
Performance Metrics 

Units Sold 

We
monitor Units Sold as a key performance metric in evaluating the performance of our console and PC game business. We define Units Sold
as the number of game titles purchased through digital channels by an individual end user. Under this metric, the purchase of a standalone
game, DLC, Season Pass or bundle on a specific platform are individually counted as a unit. For example, an individual who purchases
a standalone game and DLC on one platform, a Season Pass on another platform, and a bundle on a third platform would count as four Units
Sold. Similarly, an individual who purchases three standalone game titles on the same platform would count as three Units Sold. 

Units
Sold may be impacted by several factors that could cause fluctuations on a quarterly basis, such as game releases, our promotional activities,
which most often coincide with the global holiday season in the fourth and first quarters of each year, promotional sales on digital
platforms, console release cycles and new digital platforms. Future growth in Units Sold will depend on our ability to launch new games
and features and the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

Units

units, or 13.8 . The Company s units sold decreased due to a decrease in in sales of ARK: Survival Evolved of 0.6 million
units , offset by an increase in sales of ARK: Survival Ascended of 0.4 million units and 0.1 million units from sales of
 Bellwright during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Units sold decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, by 0.4 million units, or 11.1 . Units sold of ARK: Survival Evolved decreased
by 2.0 million units , partially offset by an increase in ARK: Survival Ascended units sold of 1.3 million and an increase
in Bellwright sales of 0.3 million units. 

Bookings 

Bookings
is a key operating metric in assessing our financial performance. Bookings adjusts for the impact of deferrals and, we believe,
provides a useful indicator of sales in a given period. It reflects the net amount of products and services sold digitally or physically in a given period, excluding the
impact of revenue deferrals. Bookings is used by management to understand sales trends and assess the volume of our sales activity over time. Bookings should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), as measures of financial performance or any
other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Below is a reconciliation
of total net revenue to Bookings, the closest GAAP financial measure.

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, bookings increased by 5.6 million, or 53.6 , compared to the three months ended September

 and Bellwright in the first half of 2024, along with the ARK: Survival Ascended DLC Aberration in September
2024. In addition to increased sales of the aforementioned titles , bookings decreased because the Company recognized deferred
revenues of approximately 8.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the release of Aberration and part

Non-GAAP Measures 

In addition to our financial
results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP or GAAP ), we
believe EBITDA, as a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. EBITDA, as used in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is presented as supplemental disclosures and should not be construed as an alternative
to net income (loss) or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. 

We present EBITDA because it
is used by management to assess our financial performance, excluding certain expenses that management believes do not reflect the ongoing
operating performance of the business. Management uses EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance when evaluating our business
strategies, making budgeting decisions and comparing performance against peer companies. 

EBITDA 

We
define EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) interest income, (ii) interest expense, (iii) (benefit from) provision for income taxes,
and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense, property and equipment. 

EBITDA
as calculated herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry and is not determined
in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected
by unusual or unexpected items. We may also incur expenses that are the same, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. 

Below
is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA, the closest GAAP financial measure.

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenues 

We
primarily derive revenue from the sale of our games through various gaming platforms. Through these platforms, users can download our
games and, for certain games, purchase virtual items to enhance their game-playing experience. We offer certain software products through
third-party digital storefronts, such as Xbox Live and Game Pass, PlayStation Network, Steam, Epic Games Store, the Apple App Store,
the Google Play Store, My Nintendo Store and the Amazon Appstore, and certain retail distributors. For sales arrangements through Xbox
Live and Game Pass, PlayStation Network, Steam, Epic Game Stores, My Nintendo Store and retail distributors, the digital platforms and
distributors have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service, and we have determined we are the agent in
the sales transaction to the end user and therefore report revenue on a net basis based on the consideration received from the digital
storefront. For sales arrangements through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, we have discretion in establishing the price
for the specified good or service and have determined that we are the principal to the end user and therefore report revenue on a gross
basis. Mobile platform fees charged by these digital storefronts are expensed as incurred and reported within cost of revenue as merchant
fees. 

We
record deferred revenue when payments are due or received in advance of the fulfillment of our associated performance obligations.

Our
net revenues through our current period top four platform providers as a proportion of our total net revenue for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

We
expect changes in revenue to correlate with trends in the use and purchase of our games. The increase in net revenues of Platforms 1,
2 and 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2023 was due to increased sales from the release of ARK: Survival
Ascended , Scorched Earth, Aberration, Bobs Tall Tales, Bellwright and Myth of Empires. The decrease in net revenues
of Platform 4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2023 was due to ARK: Survival Ascended not yet being launched
on Platform 4 as of September 30, 2024. The increase in net revenues of Platform 4 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from
2023 was due to the release of an ARK: Survival Evolved DLC on the platform. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost
of revenues includes license royalty fees, merchant fees, engine fees, server and database cost centers, game licenses and license right
amortization. For a description of our licensing arrangements, please see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to
our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. We generally expect cost of revenues to
fluctuate proportionately with revenues. 

General
and administrative 

General
and administrative expenses include rent expense, salaries, stock-based compensation, legal and professional expenses, administrative
internet and server expenses, contract costs, insurance expenses, license and permits, other taxes and travel expenses. We expect salaries
and wages to increase in a manner that is proportional with the added expenses and expertise of operating as a public company. We also
expect salaries and wages to increase as we increase headcount as we expand our product offerings. Stock-based compensation will be recorded
within research and development and general and administrative expense. We also record legal settlement expenses as components of general
and administrative expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to the additional administrative
and regulatory burden of becoming and operating as a public company. 

Research
and development 

Research
and development consists primarily of consulting expenses and salaries and wages devoted towards the development of new games and related
technologies and development costs outsourced through Suzhou Snail. We do not fund or enter into arrangements relating to the research
and development activities from third-party developers from whom we license games. We expect our research and development to increase
as we develop new content, games or technologies. 

Advertising
and marketing 

Advertising
and marketing consists of costs related to advertising and user acquisition efforts, including payments to third-party marketing agencies.
We occasionally offer our early access trial, through which we sell our games that are in development and testing. The early access trial
allows us to both monetize and receive feedback on how to improve our games over time. We plan to continue to invest in advertising and
marketing to retain and acquire players. However, sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues depending on
the timing and efficiency of our marketing efforts. 

34 

Provision
for (benefit from) income taxes 

The
benefit from income taxes consists of current income taxes in the various jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation, primarily the
United States, as well as deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in each of these jurisdictions for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Under current U.S. tax law, the federal statutory tax rate applicable to corporations is 21 . Our effective tax rate of 28 differed
from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to permanent differences, foreign withholding taxes and state taxes.

the balance of the of our cash deposits being higher on average during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest
expense 

Interest
expense primarily related to our outstanding indebtedness with third-party lenders. Interest expense decreased by 0.4 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 because of the Company having a lower average debt balance during the nine months ended September
30, 2024.

the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 28 and 21 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Capital
spending 

We
incur capital expenditures in the normal course of business and perform ongoing enhancements and updates to our social and mobile games
to maintain their quality standards. Cash used for capital expenditures in the normal course of business is typically made available
from cash flows generated by operating activities. We may also pursue acquisition opportunities for additional businesses or games that
meet our strategic and return on investment criteria. Capital needs for investment opportunities are evaluated on an individual opportunity
basis and may require significant capital commitments. 

Liquidity 

Our
primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, that are currently available as unrestricted cash. Our
unrestricted cash was 10.6 million and 15.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Our
restricted cash and cash equivalents were 1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our restricted cash primarily
consists of time deposits and is used as security for certain of our debt instruments and to secure standby letters of credit with certain
of our landlords. 

39 

As
of September 30, 2024, our 2021 Revolving Loan has a balance of 3.0 million and is due in December 2024. The Company has repaid its
Convertible Notes balance of 1.1 million, its 1.5 million financing arrangement, and the remaining 0.8 million of its short term notes
balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In concurrence with the registration of the convertible notes shares the Company
registered shares for distribution in an equity line of credit. The Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell up to 5.0
million in Class A common stock to the investor. We intend to renegotiate with the lender to extend the maturity date of the 2021 Revolving
Loan and to negotiate a new Short Term Note. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to renegotiate the terms of the 2021
Revolving Loan or obtain a new short term note with the lender at terms acceptable to us or at all. The Company was in compliance
with its debt covenants related to the 2021 Revolving Note and 2021 Promissory note for the trailing twelve months ended September 30,
2024, however it is probable that the Company will fail the covenants within the next 12 months. There is no guarantee that the Company
will receive a waiver from the lender if the covenants of the loans are breached in the future. In the event of a future breach of the
debt covenants the lender has the right, but not the obligation, to declare all or any part of the debt as due immediately and cease
making any advances or extend any further credit to the Company. 

The
Company has raised capital through the issuance of the convertible notes, equity line of credit, a short term financing arrangement with
the Company s internet and data center IDC vendor, and the distribution agreement entered into with our retail
partner which provided advanced royalties. We may need to raise additional capital and issue registered shares to draw on an equity line
of credit if needed. The need for additional capital depends on many factors, including, among other things, whether we can successfully
renegotiate the terms of our debt arrangements, the rate at which our business grows, demands for working capital, revenue generated
from existing DLCs and game titles and launches of new DLCs and new game titles, and any acquisitions that we may pursue. From time to
time, we could be required, or may otherwise attempt, to seek additional sources of capital, including, but not limited to, equity and/or
debt financings. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully access any such equity or debt financings, that the
required equity or debt financings would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or that any such financings would not be
dilutive to our stockholders. 

Our
current unrestricted cash position of approximately 10.6 million, and our expected revenue receipts will allow the Company to continue
operations beyond the next 12 months and service its current debts.

Operating
activities 

Net
cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 12.8 million as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted primarily from an increase in net income of 12.2 million, a decrease in
accounts receivable and accounts receivable - related party of 17.4 million, a decrease in prepaids expenses and prepaid expenses 
related party of 1.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accounts payable related parties of 15.9
million, a decrease in accrued expenses of 0.3 million, an increase in capitalized film costs of 0.4 million and a decrease in deferred
revenues of 1.8 million. 

The
Company had a net income of 0.7 million, and a net loss of 11.5 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
representing an increase of 12.2 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of 26.0 million, decreased general
and administrative expenses of 2.9 million, partially offset by increased research and development costs of 3.6 million, increased
costs of revenues of 9.7 million, and an increase in advertising and marketing expenses of 0.8 million, and a decrease in income tax
benefit of 3.3 million. 

Non-cash
reconciling items were 0.4) million and 0.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing
a decrease of 0.3 million. The decrease in the non-cash reconciling items was due to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets
of 1.3 million, a decrease in stock based compensation expense of 1.5 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred taxes of
 3.0 million, and an increase in accretion expense of 0.2 million. 

Our
accounts receivable - related party represent revenues attributable to certain mobile games that, for administrative reasons,
were collected on our behalf by SDE Inc. SDE ), an affiliated entity, from fiscal year 2018 through 2021. SDE no longer
collects such payments on our behalf; all such payments are received directly from the platforms through which we offer the relevant
games. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the net outstanding balances of receivables due from SDE were 9.0 million and
 13.5 million, respectively. We expect accounts receivables owed to us by SDE will be repaid within the next two fiscal years and intend
to exercise all legally available means of collection. The Company and SDE have entered into an agreement to offset uncollected amounts
against monthly payments due to SDE for operating expenses and costs of revenue. See Note 5- Accounts Receivable - Related
Party to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.

Financing
activities 

Net
cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.7 million compared to 2.4 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 6.4 million in debt
payments and 0.3 million in payments of capitalized offering costs in accounts payable. Financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 included debt repayments of 6.8 million, the purchases of treasury stock in the amount of 0.3 million, and 0.3
million in payments of capitalized offering costs partially offset by 2.3 million in borrowings on notes payable, 0.9 million for the
issuance of convertible notes and 1.9 million received for refund of a dividend withholding tax overpayment. 

Registered
Offering 

In
September 2022, we filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with
our IPO. As of the effective date of the Registration Statement, we became the parent company of Snail Games USA and a holding company,
with our principal asset consisting of all the shares of common stock of Snail Games USA. 

In
the IPO, we issued 3,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock and net proceeds from the issuance were distributed to Snail Games USA
in November 2022 in the amount of 12.0 million. In connection with the IPO, 1.0 million of the net proceeds were remitted to an escrow
account which was held to provide a source of funding for our indemnification obligations to the underwriters. The amount in escrow was
released to the Company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in November 2023. 

In
October 2023, we filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement with the SEC in connection with our issuance of convertible note, equity line
of credit and warrants related to each financing as noted below. 

41 

Capital
resources 

We
fund our operations from our net cash flows provided by operating activities. In addition to these cash flows, we have entered into certain
debt arrangements to provide additional liquidity and to finance our operations. 

Revolving
Loan 

In
December 2018, we entered into a revolving loan and security agreement with a financial institution for a revolving note in the amount
of 5.5 million. On June 17, 2021, we amended and restated our revolving loan and security agreement (the 2021 Revolving Loan to increase our revolving line of credit to 9.0 million. As amended, the 2021 Revolving Loan matured on December 31, 2023 and bore interest
at a rate equal to the prime rate less 0.25 . Interest is due and payable under the 2021 Revolving Loan on a monthly basis. The Company
amended the revolving loan agreement in December 2023, to extend the 2021 Revolving Loan maturity date to December 31, 2024. As of September
30, 2024, we had borrowings of 3.0 million outstanding under our 2021 Revolving Loan. We intend to extend the 2021 Revolving Loan prior
to its maturity date in December 2024. There is no guarantee that we will be able to extend the 2021 Revolving Loan on terms acceptable
to us in the future, or at all. 

Term
Loan 

In
June 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with a financial institution providing for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of
 3.0 million (the Term Loan ). The Term Loan, which was originally set to mature in June 2031, bears interest at a fixed
rate of 3.5 for the first five years and then at a floating rate of the Wall Street Journal prime rate until maturity. The Term Loan
is secured by our principal headquarters. 

2022
Short Term Note 

In
January 2022, we amended and restated our 2021 Revolving Loan and we executed a promissory note to obtain an additional long-term loan
with a principal balance of 10.0 million which was set to mature on January 26, 2023 (the 2022 Short Term Note ). In November
2022, the maturity date was extended to January 26, 2024. Interest was equal to the higher of 3.75 and the Wall Street Journal prime
rate plus 0.50 . The 2022 Short Term Note is secured and collateralized by our existing assets. The Company completed the last payment
obligation on the 2022 Short Term Note during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Convertible
Notes 

On
August 24, 2023, the Company issued convertible notes at a 7.4 discount and a principal balance of 1,080,000. The notes had an interest
rate of 7.5 , were paid in consecutive monthly installments beginning February 24, 2024 and matured on May 24, 2024. In connection with
the Convertible Notes the Company issued to the investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 714,285 shares that were accounted for
under the fair value method and allocated a value of 445,754. The difference of 525,754 between the proceeds allocated to the Convertible
Notes and the aggregate principal amount were accreted over the life of the notes and accounted for the fair value of the warrants and
the stated discount. Additionally, 152,500 of transaction costs incurred by the Company were recorded as a debt discount. The discount
was amortized using the effective interest rate of 103.4 . The effective interest rate is based on the principal balance discounted by
stated interest, debt issuance costs and fair value allocated to the related warrants. As of September 30, 2024, the Convertible Notes
have been repaid. The Company has registered shares for potential issuance on exercise of the warrants, or conversion of the note, on
Form S-1 that was declared effective on October 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the note holders have not exercised the warrants.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, prior to repayment, the noteholders exercised the option to convert 60,000 in principal
of the notes to 71,460 shares of the Company s Class A common stock. 

Equity
Line Purchase Agreement 

On
August 24, 2023, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Equity Line Purchase Agreement and a
registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with an investor, pursuant to which the investor has
committed to purchase up to 5,000,000 in shares of the Company s Class A common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions
set forth in the Equity Line Purchase Agreement. The Company shall not issue or sell any shares of common stock under the Equity Line
Purchase Agreement which, when aggregated with all other shares of common stock beneficially owned by the investor, would result in beneficial
ownership of more than 9.99 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock. 

Under
the terms of the Equity Line Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the investor, shares of
Class A common stock over the period commencing on the execution date of the Equity Line Purchase Agreement and ending on the earlier
of (i) December 31, 2025, or (ii) the date on which the investor shall have purchased Securities pursuant to the Equity Line Purchase
Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of the 5,000,000, provided that a registration statement covering the resale of shares of
Class A common stock that have been and may be issued under the Equity Line Purchase Agreement is declared effective by the SEC. The
Company has registered shares for potential issuance on exercise of the warrants, or drawing of the equity line, on Form S-1 that was
declared effective on October 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 the Company has not sold any Class A common stock under the Equity Line
Purchase Agreement. 

42 

2023
Note Payable 

In
July 2023, the Company entered into a cooperation agreement with its IDC vendor. The Company agreed to make the vendor the official server
host of Ark: Survival Evolved and future iterations and sequels of the game for a period of 7 years. In return, the vendor has
agreed to provide the Company with funds in cash of up to 3.0 million without discount and free of charges and costs to the Company.
The funds were repaid in monthly installments starting in November 2023 and were based on 20 of the gross monthly ARK: Survival Ascended
 revenues. The Company has imputed interest at 8.0 on draws made. As of September 30, 2024, we had repaid the remaining 1.5 million
outstanding under the Note Payable. 

Financial
covenants 

The
2021 Revolving Loan, Term Loan and the 2022 Short Term Note require us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 to
1.0. Additionally, the 2021 Revolving Loan requires us to maintain an outstanding principal balance of no more than 3.0 million for
30 consecutive days during any twelve-month period. For the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, the Company met the
minimum debt service coverage ratio required by its debt covenants. The Company repaid the 0.8 million term note that was one of
three debt facilities with the lender, in January 2024. The Company s ability to comply with the covenants, or receive waivers
for the covenants, can lead to the acceleration of payments due under the debt facilities with the lender, cause the lender to cease
making advances under the revolving agreement, or allow the lender to take possession of collateral. Due to the projected failure to
comply with the debt covenant the Company classifies its long term debt as current. 

For
additional information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 11, Revolving Loan, Short Term Note and Long-Term Debt to our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity are based upon our condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. We based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
On an on-going basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as
it becomes available. For additional information on our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. We believe that the following
critical accounting policies and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Deferred
Revenue 

The
Company recognizes, defers, and classifies the timing of deferred revenues from the sale of its products based on estimates of the release
date, technical support obligations and timing of its performance obligations. The estimated timing of release dates is dependent on
development milestones met by developers and compliance with platform requirements. At any time, platform requirements may change, or
the developers may miss milestones. Estimates in technical support obligations will vary by platform and could change from period to
period depending on user trends. Changes in estimates of our release schedule may affect the classification of short and long term deferred
revenues and the rate at which deferred revenue is recognized, which could have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

43 

Estimated
Service Period 

The
deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue for the Company s technical support obligations are estimated based on our estimated
service period. We consider a variety of data points when determining and subsequently reassessing the estimated service period for players
of our software products. Primarily, we review the weighted average number of days between players first and last days played
online. When a new game is launched and no history of online player data is available, we consider other factors to determine the estimated
service period, such as the estimated service period of other games actively being sold with similar characteristics. We also consider
publicly available sources of online trends, the service periods of our previously released software products, and, to the extent publicly
available, the service periods of our competitors software products that are similar in nature to ours. 

We
believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the use of games by our customers, as it is the best representation of the period during
which our customers play our software products. An increase in estimated service period could result in a reclassification of deferred
revenues from short term to long term and extend the period over which we would recognize said revenue resulting in a lower net income
in future periods. 

For
our consumable and durable virtual items, we use a variety of data points in determining consumption and estimated service period. We
also consider publicly available online trends, the service periods of our previously released software products, and to the extent publicly
available, the service periods of our competitors software products that are similar in nature to ours. The estimated consumption
and service periods for virtual goods are approximately 30 to 100 days. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires
significant management judgment and estimates. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated
service period may change in the future. 

Selling
Prices of Performance Obligations 

The
Company uses the following reasonably available information in developing the standalone selling prices of the performance obligations: 

Reasonably
 available data points, including third party or industry pricing, and contractually stated prices. 

Market
 conditions such as market demand, competition, market constraints, awareness of the product and market trends. 

Entity-specific
 factors including pricing strategies and objectives, market share and pricing practices for bundled arrangements. 

Deferred
Income Taxes 

The
Company s deferred income tax assets reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Changes in tax laws or the level of future
taxable income could affect the realizability of deferred income tax assets. The Company recognizes deferred income taxes based on estimates
of future taxable income and the utilization of tax loss carryforwards. In evaluating the realizability of deferred taxes, the Company
evaluates all available positive and negative evidence of whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred
tax assets, including the results of recent operations and projections of future taxable income. The weighting of positive and negative
evidence and the projection of future taxable income requires significant judgment and estimates. In addition, changes in these estimates
may have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

For
a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects
on our results of operations and financial condition, please see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting
requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation, and an exemption from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden
parachute arrangements. We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage
of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders
may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. 

44 

In
addition, an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this provision of the JOBS Act. As a result, we will
not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Therefore, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised
accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (a)(i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary
of the closing of our initial public offering; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at
least 1.235 billion; or (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as
defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded
 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year and (b) the date on which we have issued more than
 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

We
are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company
even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller
reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock
held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue
is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates
is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information
required by this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act), as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual and interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. Based on that evaluation, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in the internal control
over financial reporting as described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, in Part II, Item 9A
 Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April
1, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ), which includes our failure to properly design and implement controls related
to the accounting for income taxes and disclosure controls related to deferred taxes in the consolidated financial statements; failure
to properly classify certain operating expenses and games server costs as cost of revenues in the consolidated financial statements;
failure to identify and allocate the consideration received from a settlement between the settlement gain and revenues generating activities;
failure to properly determine the stand-alone selling prices of each performance obligation for certain digital revenue contracts; and,
failure to design and implement information technology general controls related to segregation of duties within an information system
relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, a disclosure
misstatement was identified related to the amount of revenue recognized over time and point in time. The lack of review procedures over
this disclosure gives rise to an additional material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s
Plan for Remediation 

We
are taking steps to remediate the material weaknesses, which include enhancing our financial reporting close control procedures by
implementing additional review of unusual transactions, improving our review of the over-time revenue disclosures, improving our
segregation of duties in the recording and approving of transactions, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of our income tax
footnote disclosure and our accounting for income taxes through consultation with income tax professionals, hire experts to assist
in preparing our revenue recognition policies, and hire experts in designing and implementing custom approval workflows in our ERP
system in order to remediate these material weaknesses. However, our efforts to remediate the material weaknesses may not be
effective in preventing a future material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial
reporting. 

We
are committed to ensuring that our internal controls over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively. Management believes
the efforts taken to date and the planned remediation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
While these remediation efforts are ongoing, the controls must be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested
by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the design is effective to address the risks of material misstatement. 

We
can give no assurance that the measures we have taken or plans to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified
or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement
and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we have made changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. These changes include, but are not limited to, hiring qualified experts to assist in preparing internal accounting
policies and our assessment of stand-alone selling prices assigned to the performance obligations of certain digital revenue contracts ,
working closely with income tax professionals to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our income tax disclosures and enhance our controls
over accounting for income taxes, implementation of a workflow in our ERP system that appropriately segregates duties of the users, and
additional controls over the detailed review of our operating expenses

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

Failure
to meet NASDAQ s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our Class A common stock, negatively impact
the price of our Class A common stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital. 

On
June 27, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq
Stock Market Nasdaq notifying us that, for thirty (30) consecutive business days (from May 10, 2024 to June 26,
2024), the bid price for our Class A common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion
on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule ). In accordance with
Nasdaq rules, we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until December 24, 2024 (the Compliance
Date ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. The Staff informed the Company that if, at any time before the
Compliance Date, the bid price for the Class A common stock closed at 1.00 or more for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business
days, the Staff would provide written notification to the Company that it complied with the Bid Price Rule and the matter will be
closed. 

On October 18, 2024, Nasdaq
notified the Company that the Staff had determined that for ten (10) consecutive business days, from October 4, 2024, to October 17, 2024,
the closing bid price of our Class A common stock has been at 1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Staff informed us that we had
regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and this matter is now closed. 

If
at any time we do not satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq, including compliance with the Bid Price Rule, within
the time frame granted by Nasdaq, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq. Any perception that we may not regain
compliance or a delisting of our Class A common stock by Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors,
decrease the liquidity of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, reduce the price at which such shares trade and
increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholder. In addition,
delisting of our Class A common stock from Nasdaq could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or
generating interest in our Class A common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our Class A
common stock. In addition, if our Class A common stock was delisted, our Class A common stock would be subject to rules that impose
additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers
by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our Class A common stock. This would adversely
affect the ability of investors to trade our Class A common stock and would adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.
These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our Class A common stock. 

The
National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the
sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because our Class A common stock is listed on
Nasdaq, our shares of Class A common stock are covered securities . Although the states are preempted from regulating
the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud,
and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a
particular case. Further, if we were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our shares of Class A common stock would cease to be recognized as
covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

As
mentioned above, in the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements,
but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our Class A common stock to become listed again,
stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Class A common stock or prevent our Class A common stock from meeting the
mandatory Nasdaq listing requirements. 

We
are dependent on the future success of our ARK franchise, and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such
 hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry. 

ARK
 is a hit product and has historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. The ARK franchise
contributed 82.0 of our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and our five best-selling franchises (including ARK ),
which may change year over year, in the aggregate accounted for 92.2 of our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit 
titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or
their sequels, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially, and we may incur losses. In addition, competition in our industry
is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry. Hit products offered
by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate, which could cause revenue generated from our products
to fall below our expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment
models perceived as offering better value, or if we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received products and
services, our revenue and profitability may decline. 

We
rely on license agreements to publish certain games, including games in our ARK franchise. Failure to renew our existing content licenses
on favorable terms or at all or to obtain additional licenses would impair our ability to introduce new games, improvements or enhancements
or to continue to offer our current games, which would materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

We
license certain intellectual property rights from third parties, including related parties, and in the future, we may enter into additional
agreements that provide us with licenses to valuable intellectual property rights or technology. In particular, we license intellectual
property rights related to our ARK franchise from SDE, the parent company of Studio Wildcard, which is also an entity that is
owned and controlled by the spouse of our Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer, Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman, Mr. Shi. We entered
into an original exclusive software license agreement with SDE in November 2015, for the rights to ARK: Survival Evolved , and
subsequently entered into the amended and restated ARK1 License Agreement. In December 2022 and October 2023, we amended the ARK1 License
Agreement. The terms of our license agreements with SDE may differ from those terms which would be negotiated with independent parties.
In addition, we may have disputes with SDE that may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.
The ARK franchise contributed 82.0 of our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Even if our games that are
dependent on third-party license agreements remain popular, any of our licensors could decide not to renew our existing license agreements
or not to license additional intellectual property rights to us and instead license to our competitors or develop and publish its own
games or other applications, competing with us in the marketplace. Moreover, many of our licensors develop games for other platforms
and may have significant experience and development resources available to them should they decide to compete with us rather than license
to us. For additional information concerning our license arrangements, including licensing agreements with affiliated third parties,
see Item 1 of Part I, Business Intellectual Property, included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Failure
to maintain or renew our existing material licenses or to obtain additional licenses could impair our ability to introduce new games
and new content or to continue to offer our current games, which could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial
condition. If we breach our obligations under existing or future licenses, we may be required to pay damages and our licensors may have
the right to terminate the license or change an exclusive license to a non-exclusive license. Termination of our license agreements by
a material licensor, such as SDE, would cause us to lose valuable rights, such as the rights to our ARK franchise, and would inhibit
our ability to commercialize future games, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
certain intellectual property rights may be licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis. The owners of nonexclusively licensed intellectual
property rights would be free to license such rights to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be superior to those
offered to us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property rights
that have not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or
otherwise violating the licensor s rights. In addition, the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights or technology
from third parties and related parties are generally complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple
interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope
of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations
under the relevant agreement. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects. 

We
rely on third-party platforms, such as Xbox Live and Game Pass, PlayStation Network, Steam, Epic Games Store, My Nintendo Store, the
Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and the Amazon Appstore, to distribute our games and collect revenues generated on such platforms
and rely on third-party payment service providers to collect revenues generated on our own platforms. 

Our
games are primarily purchased, accessed and operated through Xbox Live and Game Pass, PlayStation Network, Steam, Epic Games Store, My
Nintendo Store, and in the case of our mobile games, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store and the Amazon Appstore. Substantially
all of the games, DLC and in-game virtual items that we sell are purchased using the payment processing systems of these platforms and,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 94.0 of our revenues were generated through Xbox Live and Game Pass, PlayStation Network,
Steam, Epic Games Store, My Nintendo Store, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and the Amazon Appstore. Consequently, our expansion
and prospects depend on our continued relationships with these providers, and any other emerging platform providers that are widely adopted
by our target players. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a few counterparties reduces
our negotiating leverage. We are subject to the standard terms and conditions that these platform providers have for game developers,
which govern the content, promotion, distribution, operation of games and other applications on their platforms, as well as the terms
of the payment processing services provided by the platforms, and which the platform providers can change unilaterally on short notice
or without notice. As such, our business would be harmed if: 

the
 platform providers discontinue or limit our access to their platforms; 

governments
 or private parties, such as internet providers, impose bandwidth restrictions, increase charges or restrict or prohibit access to
 those platforms; 

the
 platforms increase the fees they charge us; 

the
 platforms modify their algorithms, communication channels available to developers, respective terms of service or other policies; 

the
 platforms decline in popularity; 

the
 platforms adopt changes or updates to their technology that impede integration with other software systems or otherwise require us
 to modify our technology or update our games in order to ensure players can continue to access our games and content with ease; 

the
 platforms elect or are required to change how they label free-to-play games or take payment for in-game purchases; 

the
 platforms block or limit access to the genres of games that we provide in any jurisdiction; 

the
 platform experiences a bankruptcy or other form of insolvency event; or 

we
 are unable to comply with the platform providers terms of service. 

47 

Moreover,
if our platform providers do not perform their obligations in accordance with our platform agreements or otherwise meet our business
requirements, we could be adversely impacted. For example, in the past, some of these platform providers have experienced outages for
short periods of time, unexpectedly changed their terms or conditions, or experienced issues with their features that permit our players
to purchase games or in-game virtual items. In addition, if we do not adhere to the terms and conditions of our platform providers, the
platform providers may take actions to limit the operations of, suspend or remove our games from the platform, and/or we may be exposed
to liability or litigation. For example, in August 2020, Epic Games, Inc. Epic Games ), attempted to bypass Apple and Google s
payment systems for in-game purchases with an update that allowed users to make purchases directly through Epic Games in its game, Fortnite.
Apple and Google promptly removed Fortnite from their respective app stores, and Apple filed a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief to block
the use of Epic Games payment system and sought monetary damages to recover funds made while the updated version of Fortnite was
active. 

If
any such events described above occur on a short-term or long-term basis, or if these third-party platforms and online payment service
providers otherwise experience issues that impact the ability of players to download or access our games, access social features, or
make in-game purchases, it would have a material adverse effect on our brands and reputation, as well as our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Our
business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms, which may not generate
immediate or near-term revenues, and as a result, our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during
console transitions than during other times. 

We
derive most of our revenue from publishing video games on third-party platform providers, such as Xbox Live and Game Pass, PlayStation
Network, Steam, Epic Games Store, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, My Nintendo Store and the Amazon Appstore, which, in the
aggregate, comprised 94.0 of our net revenue by product platform for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The success of our business
is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. 

Historically,
when next generation consoles are announced or introduced into the market, consumers have typically reduced their purchases of products
for prior-generation consoles in anticipation of purchasing a next-generation console and products for that console. During these periods,
sales of the products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance. Console transitions may have a comparable
impact on sales of DLC, amplifying the impact on our revenues. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the
next-generation consoles. In addition, as console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price
reductions, and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices. During console transitions, we may simultaneously incur
costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles for prior-generation video game platforms, which may not sell at premium prices,
and also in developing products for next-generation platforms, which may not generate immediate or near-term revenues. As a result, our
business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during console transitions than during other times. 

Tax
law or tax rate changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability. 

Our
effective tax rate was 28 and 21 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In general, changes in
applicable U.S. federal and state and foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility
of retroactive effect, could affect our tax expense. In addition, taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose
changes to their tax laws and regulations. These potential changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, long-term
tax planning and financial results. 

48 

The
Company has debt obligations with short term durations that are coming due within one year. 

We
have significant debt obligations coming due within one year. Our current revolving loan has a balance of 3.0 million as of September
30, 2024, and is due for repayment on December 31, 2024. The Company intends to extend the revolving loan and renew our short-term note
debt arrangement and faces the risk that we will be unable to. If we are unable to extend the revolving loan or renew the debt arrangement,
the Company may have significantly reduced unrestricted cash which could adversely impact our results of operations and ability to invest
in the development and acquisition of IP. See Note 11 Revolving Loan, Short Term Note and Long-Term Debt to our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

We
cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully implemented or it will enhance stockholder value, and share repurchases
could affect the price of our Class A common stock. 

In
November 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5 million of our outstanding Class A common stock
(the Share Repurchase Program ), which does not have a fixed expiration date. Share repurchases under the program may be
made from time to time through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and are subject
to market and business conditions, levels of available liquidity, cash requirements for other purposes, regulatory, and other relevant
factors, at the discretion of management and in accordance with applicable federal securities laws and other applicable legal requirements
and Nasdaq listing rules. The timing, pricing, and size of share repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited
to, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and general market and economic conditions. As of September 30, 2024, approximately
 1.3 million of the Share Repurchase Program remains available for future repurchases. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate
us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result
in a decrease in the price of our Class A common stock. 

49 

Repurchases
under our Share Repurchase Program will decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and therefore could affect
the price of our Class A common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of our Share Repurchase Program could also cause the
price of our Class A common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could reduce the market liquidity
for our Class A common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our Share Repurchase Program will diminish our cash reserves, which could
impact our ability to further develop our business and service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases
will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased
such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and
investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our Class A common stock price. Although our Share Repurchase Program is intended
to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term price fluctuations could reduce the program s effectiveness. 

We
identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we may identify additional material weaknesses in
the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements.
If we do not effectively remediate the material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose
any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Our
management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting involving the failure to properly design and
implement controls related to the accounting for income taxes and disclosure controls related to deferred taxes in the consolidated financial
statements; failure to properly classify certain operating expenses and games server costs as cost of revenues in the consolidated financial
statements; failure to identify and allocate the consideration received from a settlement between the settlement gain and revenues generating
activities; failure to properly determine the stand-alone selling prices of each performance obligation for certain digital revenue contracts;
and, failure to design and implement information technology general controls related to segregation of duties within an information system
relevant to the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. Due to the size and nature of our organization
and the implementation timing of our new cloud-based ERP system, we had limited personnel and system capabilities for adequate segregation
of duties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Part I, Item 4, Controls and Procedures, in this Quarterly
Report for information regarding the identified material weaknesses and our actions to date to remediate the material weaknesses. In
addition, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, a disclosure misstatement was identified related to the amount of revenue recognized
over time and point in time. The lack of review procedures over this disclosure gives rise to a material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting. As a result of the material weaknesses, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

We
are taking steps to remediate the material weaknesses, which include to enhancing our financial reporting close control procedures by
implementing additional review of unusual transactions, improving our review of the over-time revenue disclosures, improving our segregation
of duties in the recording and approving of transactions, ensuring the completeness of our income tax footnote disclosure through consultation
with income tax professionals, hire experts to assist in preparing our revenue recognition policies, and hire experts in designing and
implementing custom approval workflows in our ERP system in order to remediate these material weaknesses. However, our efforts to remediate
the material weaknesses may not be effective in preventing a future material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control
over financial reporting. If we do not effectively remediate the material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, which could cause our reported
financial results to be materially misstated, result in the loss of investor confidence and cause the market price of our Class A common
stock to decline. 

We
can give no assurance that the measures we have taken or plans to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified
or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement
and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. 

50 

We
depend on our key management and product development personnel. 

Our
continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and maintaining positive relationships with our games 
developers, including Studio Wildcard, and the product development personnel responsible for content creation and development of our
 ARK franchise. 

On
April 15, 2024, Jim S. Tsai notified the Company of his decision to resign from his position as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
and all of the Company s subsidiaries, including, Snail Games USA, Inc., with such resignation effective April 15, 2024; however,
Mr. Tsai remained with the Company for a 30-day transition period. In conjunction with Mr. Tsai s resignation as the Company s
Chief Executive Officer, the Company appointed Hai Shi and Xuedong (Tony) Tian to serve as the Company s new Co-Chief Executive
Officers, effective April 15, 2024. We are highly dependent on the expertise, skill and knowledge of Mr. Shi, our Founder, Co-Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman, Mr. Tian, our other Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Peter Kang, our Vice President
and Director of Business Development and Operations. The loss of the services of any or all of these executive officers, or certain key
product development personnel, including those employed by studio partners, such as Studio Wildcard, could significantly harm our business.
In addition, if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company, we may lose additional personnel, experience
material interruptions in product development, delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors,
suppliers and customers, which would significantly harm our business. Failure to continue to attract and retain qualified management
and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects.

On
November 10, 2022, our board of directors authorized a Share Repurchase Program under which we may repurchase up to 5 million in outstanding
shares of our Class A common stock, subject to ongoing compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. The program does not have a fixed expiration
date. The share repurchases may be made from time to time through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions
or otherwise and are subject to market and business conditions, levels of available liquidity, cash requirements for other purposes,
regulatory, and other relevant factors. There were no share repurchases settled in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September
30, 2024, 1,350,275 shares of Class A common stock were repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately 3.7 million. The average price paid per share was 2.72 and approximately 1.3 million aggregate amount of shares
of Class A common stock remain available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program. For more information regarding the Share
Repurchase Program refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements
