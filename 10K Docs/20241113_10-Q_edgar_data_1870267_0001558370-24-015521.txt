The Company may also invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, particularly during periods of market dislocation. The companies in which the Company intends to invest typically are highly leveraged, and, in most cases, not rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, the Adviser believes that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard Poor s system) from the national securities rating organizations. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans or high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk and have speculative characteristics as compared to investment grade debt instruments.

This portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply; and (3) Fifteen percent of the amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized). 
 These calculations will be pro-rated for any period of less than a full calendar quarter and will be adjusted for share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable, or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date, and will equal of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company will be required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, the Company will consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation will not be permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company will record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related incentive fees paid or accrued in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is either no accrual for such year or a reduction in prior accruals for changes in net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. Incentive Fee Cap No incentive fee will be paid to the Adviser to the extent that, after such payment, the cumulative income-based incentive fees and capital gains-based incentive fees paid to date would be greater than fifteen percent of the Company s Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income since the date of its election to become a BDC (the Incentive Fee Cap ). Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income is equal to the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each period since the date of the Company s election to become a BDC and (b) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, cumulative aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation, in each case, since the date of the Company s election to become a BDC. If, for any relevant period, the Incentive Fee Cap calculation results in the Company paying less than the amount of the income-based incentive fee and the capital gains-based incentive fee as calculated above, then the difference between (a) such amount and (b) the Incentive Fee Cap will not be paid by the Company, and will not be received by the Adviser, either at the end of such relevant period or at the end of any future period.

 Overview We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Maryland corporation on June 21, 2021, we are externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. We also intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser a management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Also, under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including fees of the Sub-Administrator, rent, technology systems (including subscription fees and other costs and expenses related to Bloomberg Professional Services and the Adviser s third-party Order Management System), insurance and the Company s allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of its Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator offers on the Company s behalf managerial assistance to portfolio companies to which the Company will be required to offer such assistance. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Company will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. Our investment objective is to seek current income as well as capital appreciation, while emphasizing the preservation of capital. The Company s focus is fixed income investments, primarily in the senior layers of the capital structure of leveraged companies. These investments primarily consist of loans and bonds, sourced either through direct investments, the syndicated market or through trading in the secondary market. While most of our investments are in private U.S. companies (subject to compliance with BDC regulatory requirement to invest at least 70 of its assets in private U.S. companies), we also can invest from time to time in European and other non-U.S. companies. In connection with the Company s debt investments, the Company may also receive equity interests such as options, warrants or other instruments as additional consideration. The Company generally invests in middle market companies, which the Adviser considers to be companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of between 50 million and 300 million. The Company can also invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, particularly during periods of market dislocation. The companies in which the Company invests in typically are highly leveraged, and, in most cases, not rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, the Adviser believes that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard Poor s system) from the national securities rating organizations. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans or high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk and have speculative characteristics as compared to investment grade debt instruments. Investments We focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies. Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in eligible assets, including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies, public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Exchange Act, public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We are also permitted to make certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 77.5 and 77.3 , respectively, of our total assets were invested in eligible assets. Revenues We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from dividends on our equity interests, capital gains on the disposition of investments, and certain lease, fee, and other income. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, end-of-term or exit fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment related income.

 other direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; costs associated with the Company s reporting and compliance obligations, including under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws (including reporting under Sections 13 and 16 under the Exchange Act and anti-money laundering compliance); dues, fees and charges of any trade association of which the Company is a member; costs associated with the formation, management, governance, operation, restructuring, maintenance (including any amendments to constituent documents), winding up, dissolution or liquidation of entities; fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with or incidental to co-investments or joint ventures (whether or not consummated) that are not borne by co-investors or joint venture partners; the allocated costs incurred by the Administrator in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; and all other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or the Company in connection with administering the Company s business, including payments under the Administration Agreement that will be based upon the Company s allocable portion of overhead, and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the fees of the Sub-Administrator, rent, technology systems (including subscription fees and other costs and expenses related to Bloomberg Professional Services and the Adviser s third-party Order Management System), insurance and the Company s allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of its Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. 
 Generally, during periods of asset growth, the Company expects its general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above. Common expenses frequently are incurred on behalf of the Company and one or more of the Adviser s other clients. The Adviser seeks to allocate those common expenses among the Company and such other clients in a manner that is fair and reasonable over time, and the Adviser may bear certain expenses directly that otherwise are not allocated to the Company or to its other clients. To address potential conflicts of interest, the Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures for the allocation of common expenses. The Adviser, for instance, allocates expenses to clients, including the Company, in accordance with the client s arrangements with the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser may use a variety of methods to allocate common expenses, including methods based on assets under management, relative use of a product or service, the nature or source of a product or service, the relative benefits derived by the Company and its other clients from a product or service, size of the Company s or the other clients investment, or other relevant factors. Expense allocations may, at times, depend on subjective determinations by the Adviser. Allocations of common expenses by the Adviser to the Company is subject to the review and approval of the Company s Board of Directors. The Adviser has agreed to limit, indefinitely, the amount of Specified Expenses borne by the Company to an amount not to exceed 0.25 per annum of the greater of (i) the Company s aggregate Capital Commitments and (ii) the Company s net assets, at the time of determination (i.e., the Expense Cap). Specified Expenses include the following expenses incurred by the Company in its ordinary course of business: (i) third-party fund administration and fund accounting; (ii) printing and mailing expenses; (iii) professional fees, consisting of legal, compliance, tax and audit fees; (iv) treasury and compliance function expenses, including the salary of any internal Redwood resources reimbursed by the Company; (v) research expenses relating to Bloomberg, expert network services, and investment research subscriptions, (vi) Independent Director fees and expenses; (vii) premiums for director and officer and errors and omissions insurance; and (viii) valuation of Company investments. For the avoidance of doubt, Specified Expenses do not include any other expenses of the Company incurred in connection with its operations, including but not limited to, (i) any advisory fees payable by the Company under an effective advisory agreement, (ii) investment expenses (such as fees and expenses of outside legal counsel or third-party consultants, due diligence-related fees and other costs, expenses and liabilities with respect to consummated and unconsummated investments), (iii) taxes paid, (iv) interest expenses and fees on borrowing, (v) fees incurred in connection with the establishment of borrowing or other leverage arrangements, (vi) brokerage commissions, (vii) expenses related to litigation and potential litigation, and (viii) extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Company s business, including such expenses as approved by the Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors. The Expense Cap is based on the greater of (i) the Company s aggregate Capital Commitments, without reduction for contributed capital or Capital Commitments no longer available to be called by the Company and (ii) the Company s net assets, in each case as calculated at the end of a calendar year. In any year, to the extent that Specified Expenses exceed the Expense Cap, the Adviser will promptly waive fees or reimburse the Company for expenses necessary to eliminate such excess.

 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that the base management fee be calculated at an annual rate of 1.5 of the Company s Weighted Average Net Asset Value and is payable quarterly in arrears. Additionally, the Investment Advisory Agreement provides that the Adviser may be entitled to an incentive fee under certain circumstances. Critical accounting policies and estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the unaudited interim financial statements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. Valuation of portfolio investments The Company values investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, the Company expects that there will not be readily available market values for many of the investments that are in its portfolio, and the Company values such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, the Company s Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors under the Company s valuation policy and process, as described in more detail below. The Company follows ASC 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to the Company on the reporting period date. ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies: Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and may require significant management judgment or estimation. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of the Company s investments and any credit facility are expected to be classified as Level 3. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than the Company s valuation and those differences may be material. In addition to using the above inputs in cash equivalents, investments and any credit facility valuations, the Company employs the valuation policy approved by the Board of Directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the Company s valuation policy, the Company evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which the Company s investments are trading, in determining fair value. Revenue recognition Interest and dividend income, including income paid-in-kind, is recorded on an accrual basis, when such amounts are considered collectible. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with

 respect to capital commitments are generally amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment. Other fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar income due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income. Certain of our debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as general market factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the effective-interest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in excess of the loan s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income. Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. Payment-in-kind interest The Company expects that some of the investments in its portfolio may contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income. In order for the Company to maintain its ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though the Company will not have collected any cash with respect to interest on PIK securities. Federal income taxes The Company intends to elect to be treated, and intends to qualify annually to maintain its election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain the Company s RIC tax election, the Company must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. The Company also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to its shareholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of the Company s investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. If the Company fails to satisfy the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements, the Company will be liable for a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on the portion of the undistributed amounts of such income that are less than the amounts required to be distributed based on the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). The Company currently intends to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. Because federal income tax regulations differ from U.S. GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and U.S. GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences will be reclassified among capital accounts in the Company s unaudited interim financial statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.

The Credit Agreement had an initial multicurrency revolving loan commitment of 85 million, with uncommitted capacity to increase the revolving loan commitments up to 500 million in the form of dollar commitments or multicurrency commitments. On May 13, 2022, the Company entered into an Incremental Commitment and Assumption Agreement and First Amendment to Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, the assuming lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase its revolving loan commitments thereunder to 145 million, with 100 million in the form of multicurrency commitments and 45 million in the form of dollar commitments. The Credit Agreement permits the Company to use up to 25 million of multicurrency commitments to incur letters of credit. On August 26, 2022, the Company entered into an Incremental Commitment and Assumption Agreement (the Incremental Agreement ), which supplements the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2022 (as amended, restated, supplemented and otherwise modified to date, including by the Incremental Agreement, the Credit Agreement ), among the Company, as borrower, ING Capital LLC ING ), as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. Pursuant to the Incremental Agreement, among other changes, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement increased from 145 million to 250 million, consisting of an increase in dollar commitments from 45 million to 140 million and of multicurrency commitments from 100 million to 110 million. In connection with such increase, the Company paid the lenders providing commitments certain fees. On January 17, 2024, the Company signed an Incremental Agreement, which supplements the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2022 (as amended, restated, supplemented and otherwise modified to date, including by the Credit Agreement), among the Company, as borrower, ING, as administrative agent and the Lenders Party Thereto. Pursuant to the Incremental Agreement, among other changes, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement increased from 250 million to 255 million. Under Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, prior to March 23, 2018, a BDC was generally not permitted to issue senior securities unless after giving effect thereto the BDC met a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which includes all borrowings of the BDC, of at least 200 . On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act SBCAA was signed into law, which among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to have a ratio of total outstanding indebtedness to net assets of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200 asset coverage requirement. The Company s sole initial shareholder approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act to the Company. As a result, under current law, the Company is permitted as a BDC to issue senior securities in amounts such that the Company s asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities (a two-to-one debt-to-equity ratio). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s asset coverage ratio were 208.5 and 243.9 , respectively.

Payments under the Administration Agreement will be based upon the Company s allocable portion of the overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the fees of the Sub-Administrator, rent, technology systems (including subscription fees and other costs and expenses related to Bloomberg Professional Services and the Adviser s third-party Order Management System), insurance and the Company s allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of its Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator has entered into a sub-administration agreement with the Sub-Administrator, pursuant to which the Administrator will delegate certain administrative functions to the Sub-Administrator. If any of the Company s contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, the costs under any new agreements may increase. In addition, the Company will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services that the Company expects to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by the Company s shareholders. Distributions Our dividends and distributions to common shareholders, if any, are determined and declared by our Board of Directors and are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are declared considering our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to shareholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year. We do not have a policy to pay distributions at a specific level and expect to continue to distribute substantially all of our taxable income. We cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. Distributions to shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, totaled 6.3 million 0.38 per share) and 5.5 million 0.38 per share), respectively. Distributions to shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, totaled 18.9 million 1.14 per share) and 15.8 million 1.14 per share), respectively. Tax characteristics of any distributions are reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV or Form 1042-S after the end of the calendar year. We elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and 100 of any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. We may, at our discretion, carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4 excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our shareholders. We will accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable RIC tax treatment. In addition, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize

 income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC and may be subject to an excise tax. In order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we have the ability to pay a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a sufficient portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion can generally be as low as 20 and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Transactions with Related Persons; Review, Approval or Ratification of Transaction with Related Persons The Company has entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Company entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, effective as of March 31, 2022, in accordance with the 1940 Act. On September 30, 2022, the Company and the Adviser entered into an Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement ). For these services, the Company will pay (1) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of the Company s Weighted Average Net Asset Value and (2) an incentive fee based on the Company s performance. The Company has entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator will perform, or oversee the performance of, the Company s required administrative services. Payments under the Administration Agreement will be based upon the Company s allocable portion of the overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the fees of the Sub-Administrator, rent, technology systems (including subscription fees and other costs and expenses related to Bloomberg Professional Services and the Adviser s third-party Order Management System), insurance and the Company s allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of its Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. Potential Conflicts of Interest The Adviser and its affiliates may engage in management or investment activities on behalf of entities that have overlapping objectives and strategies with the Company. The Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities to the Company and any others to which they may provide management or investment services. In order to address these conflicts, the Adviser has an investment allocation policy that seeks to ensure the fair and equitable allocation of investment opportunities and addresses the co-investment restrictions set forth under the 1940 Act. The Company expects that there will not be readily available market values for many of the investments that will be in its portfolio, and the Company will value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, the Company s Valuation Designee, under the supervision of the Board pursuant to the Company s valuation policy and process. Valuations of private investments and private companies require judgment, are inherently uncertain, often fluctuate and are frequently based on estimates. It is possible that determinations of fair value will differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market for these investments existed. If determinations regarding the fair value of investments were materially higher than the values that were ultimately realized upon the sale of such investments, the returns to the Company s investors would be adversely affected. In connection with that determination, investment professionals from the Adviser, the Company s Valuation Designee, will determine valuations of the investments in the portfolio company based upon the most recent portfolio company financial statements available and projected financial results of each portfolio company. The participation of the Adviser s investment professionals in the valuation process could result in a conflict of interest as the Adviser s base management fee will be based, in part, on the Company s net assets and the incentive fees will be based, in part, on unrealized gains and losses. Under the incentive fee structure in the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company s adjusted net investment income for purposes thereof is computed and paid on income that may include interest income that has been accrued but not yet received in cash. This fee structure may give rise to a conflict of interest for the Adviser to the extent that it encourages the Adviser to favor debt financings that provide for deferred interest, rather than current cash payments of interest. The Adviser may have an incentive to invest in deferred interest securities in circumstances where it would not have done so but for the opportunity to continue to earn the incentive fee even when the issuers of the deferred interest securities would not be able to make actual cash payments to the Company on such securities. This risk could be increased because, under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is not obligated to reimburse the Company for incentive fees it receives even if the Company subsequently incur losses or never receives in cash the deferred income that was previously accrued. In addition, the incentive fee payable to the Adviser may create an incentive for the Adviser to cause the Company to realize capital gains or losses that may not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders. Under the incentive fee structure, the Adviser benefits when the Company recognizes capital gains and, because the Adviser determines when an investment is sold, the Adviser controls the timing of the recognition of such capital gains.

Table of Contents 
 The professionals of the Adviser currently serve and may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as the Company does or of accounts sponsored or managed by the Adviser or its affiliates. Similarly, the Adviser or its affiliates currently manage and may have other clients with similar or competing investment objectives. In serving in these multiple capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders. As a result, those individuals may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities among the Company and other accounts advised by or affiliated with the Adviser or its affiliates. Certain of these accounts may provide for higher management or incentive fees, greater expense reimbursements or overhead allocations, or permit the Adviser and its affiliates to receive higher origination and other transaction fees, all of which may contribute to this conflict of interest and create an incentive for the Adviser to favor such other accounts. For example, the 1940 Act restricts the Adviser from receiving more than a 1 fee in connection with loans that the Company acquires, or originates, a limitation that does not exist for certain other accounts. The Adviser seeks to allocate investment opportunities among eligible accounts in a manner that is fair and equitable over time and consistent with its allocation policy. However, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will be allocated to the Company fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to participate in all investment opportunities that are suitable to it. The Company is prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with its affiliates without the prior approval of the Independent Directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of the Company s outstanding voting securities will be its affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and the Company generally will be prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of the Independent Directors. The Company will consider the Adviser and its affiliates to be its affiliates for such purposes. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain joint transactions with certain of the Company s affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company, without prior approval of the Independent Directors and, in some cases, the SEC. The Company will be prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to, among others, any person who owns more than 25 of the Company s voting securities or certain of that person s affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. The Company may, however, invest alongside the Adviser and its affiliates other clients in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, the Company may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff permitting the Company and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that the Adviser, acting on the Company s behalf and on behalf of its other clients, negotiates no term other than price. The Company may also invest alongside the Adviser s other clients as otherwise permissible under regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and the Adviser s allocation policy. On April 1, 2022, the SEC granted to the Adviser and the Company exemptive relief on which we expect to rely to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser in a manner consistent with our investment, objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. The Adviser and its affiliates may from time to time incur expenses on behalf of the Company and their other clients (which may include one or more investment funds established by the Adviser or its affiliates). Although the Adviser and its affiliates will attempt to allocate such expenses on a basis that they consider equitable, there can be no assurance that such expenses will be allocated appropriately in all cases. As a result, the Company may bear an expense to which it does not receive a proportionate (or any) benefit. Recent Developments Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of the unaudited interim financial statements and has determined that there are no subsequent events outside the ordinary scope of business that require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statement, except as disclosed below: The Company committed to various new investments and funded existing committed delayed draw facilities with an aggregate par value of 16.2 million and received paydowns or disposed of existing investments with an aggregate par value of 9.7 million. Credit Facility On November 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fifth Amendment extends the (i) revolver availability period from April 6, 2025 to April 6, 2026 and (ii) scheduled maturity date from April 6, 2026 to April 6, 2027.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. Uncertainty with respect to a potential economic downturn or recession, the economic effects of the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts have introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility have materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. For additional information concerning a potential economic downturn or recession, the Russia-Ukraine and Hamas-Israel conflicts and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Risk Factors. Investment valuation risk Because there is not a readily available market value for certain of the investments in our portfolio, we value such of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, the Company s Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors based on, among other things, the input of our management and audit committee and independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our Board of Directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise and are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates as well as Notes 2 and 3 to our financial statements from September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023 for more information relating to our investment valuation. Interest rate risk Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our investments in portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase, thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. Furthermore, changes in interest rates can impact our interest rate swaps, as interest rate swaps are sensitive to changes in the market s interest rate expectations and the duration of the swap. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 81.8 and 76.8 , respectively, of debt investments in our portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR, PRIME or the EURIBOR Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the percentage of floating rate debt investments in our portfolio that were subject to an interest rate floor was 81.7 and 79.3 , respectively. Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months only if the index exceeds the floor. Based on our Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding the related management fees and incentive fee impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering that interest rate floors for variable rate instruments and that our assets and liabilities may not have the same base rate period as assumed in this table) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

 (1) Includes the impact of our interest rate swaps as a result of interest rate changes. For interest rate swaps, we assume only the next 1 year is impacted by the change in base rate and so we multiply the notional amount of our swap by the Basis Point Change. It does not adjust interest swaps for changes in future years, and it does not adjust interest rate swaps for the implied interest rate expectation in the swaps . 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As of the period covered by this report, we, including our Co-Presidents and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including our Co-Presidents and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including our Co-Presidents and Chief Financial Officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company, the Adviser, the Administrator and their wholly-owned subsidiaries are not currently subject to any material litigation. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes from our risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures None. Item 5. Other Information During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, of our directors or executive officers or Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
