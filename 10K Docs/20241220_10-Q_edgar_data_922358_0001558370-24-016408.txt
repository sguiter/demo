 EXPLANATORY NOTE This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Ferrellgas Partners refers to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. itself, with its consolidated subsidiaries. References to the operating partnership mean Ferrellgas, L.P., together (except where the context indicates otherwise) with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas Finance Corp. The terms us, we, our, ours, consolidated, the Company or Ferrellgas refer to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., except when used in connection with Class A Units or Class B Units, in which case these terms refer to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. without its consolidated subsidiaries. Ferrellgas Partners is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1994 and is primarily engaged in the retail distribution of propane and related equipment sales. Our Class A Units are traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol FGPR. The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners and the Preferred Unitholders are the only limited partners of the operating partnership. Ferrellgas, Inc. is the sole general partner of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership and, excluding the economic interests attributable to the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, owns an approximate 1 general partner economic interest in each, and, therefore, an effective 2 general partner economic interest in the operating partnership. Excluding the economic interests attributable to the Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners owns an approximate 99 limited partner interest in the operating partnership. Our general partner performs all management functions for us. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, currently beneficially owns approximately 23.4 of our outstanding Class A Units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100 by an employee stock ownership trust. We believe that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for these entities provides the following benefits: enhances investors understanding of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner that management views and operates the business; eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation, since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership; and creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of a combined presentation. 
 To help investors understand the differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, this report provides separate condensed consolidated financial statements for Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Noncontrolling interests, Class A Units, Class B Units, shareholders' equity (deficit) and partners' deficit are the main areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferrellgas Partners and those of the operating partnership. A single set of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements is presented that includes separate discussions for Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, when applicable. A combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section is also included that presents combined information and discrete information related to each entity, as applicable. In order to highlight the differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, this report includes the following sections that provide separate financial information for Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership: condensed consolidated financial statements; and certain accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, which denote Ferrellgas Partners and The operating partnership in sections where applicable.

The Credit Agreement includes a sublimit not to exceed million for the issuance of letters of credit. On December 5, 2024, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date from March 30, 2025 to December 31, 2025. On March 31, 2025, in conjunction with the commencement of the Fifth Amendment, the commitment level for the Credit Facility will be reduced from million to million. All borrowings under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by the general partner and the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the operating partnership (other than Ferrellgas Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Receivables, LLC) and a limited-recourse guaranty from Ferrellgas Partners (limited to its equity interests in the operating partnership).

(1) Defined generally as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense. (2) Defined generally as the ratio of total first priority secured indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA. (3) Defined generally as the ratio of total indebtedness (net of unrestricted cash, subject to certain limits) to adjusted EBITDA. (4) Ratio was x immediately prior to the quarter ended October 31, 2024.

In addition to the financial covenants, the Credit Agreement includes covenants that may (or if not met will) restrict the ability of the operating partnership to take certain actions. In particular, under these covenants, subject to certain exceptions and additional requirements, the operating partnership is permitted to make cash distributions to holders of Preferred Units, redemptions of Preferred Units conditional to a refinancing event, and other restricted payments (i) only in limited amounts specified in the Credit Agreement and (ii) only if availability under the Credit Facility exceeds the greater of million and of the Borrowing Base and the operating partnership s total net leverage ratio is not greater than to 1.0. The Credit Agreement, as amended on July 2, 2024, restricts the transfer of cash from the operating partnership to Ferrellgas Partners to make distributions. Therefore, Ferrellgas Partners is currently unable to make distributions to its Class A and Class B unitholders. As of October 31, 2024, the operating partnership is in compliance with all of its debt covenants. Senior unsecured notes The operating partnership has million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes issued and outstanding pursuant to indentures each dated March 30, 2021.

Further, if the operating partnership s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (defined generally to mean the ratio of trailing quarters consolidated EBITDA to consolidated fixed charges, both as adjusted for certain, specified items) is equal to or less than to 1.00 (on a pro forma basis giving effect to the restricted payment and, if applicable, certain other specified events), the amount of distributions and other restricted payments the operating partnership is permitted to make under the indentures is further limited. As of October 31, 2024, the operating partnership is in compliance with all of its debt covenants. The scheduled annual principal payments on long-term debt are as follows: 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total On July 10, 2024, letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount of million were issued to the surety providers under an appeal bond. See Note L Contingencies and commitments for further information. Letters of credit were also used to secure insurance arrangements, product purchases and commodity hedges. Letters of credit outstanding at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 totaled million and million, respectively. Due to the timing of the March 30, 2025 maturity date of the Credit Facility noted above and the letters of credit which it secures, there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of the Company s fiscal 2024 Annual Report. Our condensed financial statements were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. As noted above, the maturity date was subsequently extended to December 31, 2025, which alleviated the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern at least one year from the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report. As of October 31, 2024, Ferrellgas had available borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility of million. Assets subject to lien under the Credit Facility were million as of October 31, 2024. Preferred Units (the Preferred Units ), having an aggregate initial liquidation preference of million. Redemption of the Preferred Units in the near term is not probable because of the high redemption price in the first three to four years. As described in greater detail under Issuer Redemption Right below, the Redemption Price for the Preferred Units is based upon the greater of the amount that would result in a x MOIC (defined below) and the amount that would result in a internal rate of return. If the Preferred Units were redeemed during the first three to four years after issuance, the x MOIC would require a large premium payment and that large premium payment would result in an internal rate of return far in excess of the minimum . Consequently, it is unlikely that Ferrellgas would be able to achieve any savings in its cost of capital by redeeming the Preferred Units during the first three to four years after issuance.

A partial redemption of the Preferred Units is permitted only in the event the aggregate amount to be paid in respect of all Preferred Units included in such partial redemption is at least million. Investor Redemption Right In the event that (i) any Class B Units are outstanding, or (ii) (x) Class B Units are outstanding and (y) no more than Preferred Units are outstanding, at any time on and after March 30, 2031, the Required Holders may elect, by delivery of written notice, to have the operating partnership fully redeem each remaining outstanding Preferred Unit for an amount in cash equal to the Redemption Price. Required Holders refers to both (i) holders owning at least of the total Preferred Units outstanding at any time and (ii) certain initial affiliated purchasers, for so long as such initial affiliated purchasers collectively own at least of the Preferred Units outstanding at such time. In the event that (i) Class B Units are outstanding and (ii) more than Preferred Units are outstanding, the Required Holders will have the right to trigger a sale of the operating partnership after March 30, 2031. If the operating partnership fails to consummate a sale that would pay the Redemption Price in full within days of written notice requiring such sale, the Required Holders will have the right to appoint a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the general partner and initiate a sale of the operating partnership. Change of Control Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the OpCo LPA Amendment), the Required Holders will have the option to require the redemption of all or a portion of the Preferred Units in cash in an amount equal to the Redemption Price; provided, that such Redemption Price shall not be payable unless the operating partnership shall have first made any required change of control offer pursuant to the indentures governing the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes and purchased all such 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes tendered pursuant to such offer (unless otherwise waived by such noteholders); provided, further that the Redemption Price shall be paid immediately following the purchase of such tendered Notes (if any). Fair Value of Embedded Derivatives Fe rrellgas identified the investor redemption right and the change in control option as embedded derivatives that require bifurcation as they are not clearly and closely related to the debt host contract and has concluded that the fair values at issuance and at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, are immaterial to the financial statements.

Tax Distributions are treated as advances against, and reduce, future cash distributions for any reason, including payments in redemption of Preferred Units or PIK Units, or payments to the holders in their capacity as such pursuant to any side letter or other agreement.

Eddystone alleges that Ferrellgas transferred assets out of JTS prior to the sale of the membership interest in JTS to Jamex Transfer Holdings, and that those transfers should be avoided so that the assets can be used to satisfy the amount owed by JTS to Eddystone as a result of the arbitration. Eddystone also alleges that JTS was an alter ego of Bridger and Ferrellgas and that Bridger and Ferrellgas breached both an implicit contract as well as fiduciary duties allegedly owed to Eddystone as a creditor of JTS. The Court decided summary judgment motions in March 2022 and the segments of the bench trial were completed in September 2022, December 2022 and February 2023, respectively. As set by the Court, briefings were held through May 2023 and closing arguments were held in August 2023. On June 7, 2024, the Court entered an Order and Judgment (the Judgment in the EDPA Lawsuit. The Judgment was in favor of all defendants on Eddystone s alter ego and fiduciary duty claims. Further, the Judgment was in favor of Ferrellgas, L.P. and certain other defendants on Eddystone s intentional and constructive fraudulent transfer claims. However, on Eddystone s intentional and constructive fraudulent transfer claims, Judgment was entered against Bridger Energy, LLC in the amount of million, Bridger Transportation, LLC in the amount of million, and Ferrellgas Partners, L.P and Bridger in the amount of million. Ferrellgas and the other defendants are evaluating the Judgment and considering their options and have begun the process to appeal the Judgment, as further described below. Ferrellgas Partners, Bridger, Bridger Energy, LLC and Bridger Transportation, LLC (collectively, the Appellants filed their notice of appeal on July 3, 2024 to appeal the Judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On July 9, 2024, the District Court approved an order approving an appeal bond on behalf of Ferrellgas Partners, Bridger Energy, and Bridger Transportation (the Bonded Appellants in the amount of million (the Appeal Bond and granting a stay of execution with respect to the Bonded Appellants. As of October 31, 2024, we recorded an accrued liability of million, which is included in other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. This accrual is included in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. This amount reflects management s assessment of our best estimate of probable loss based on current information and after evaluation of various potential outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of probable loss could change based on the progression of the case, including the appeal process. We will adjust the accrual for any subsequent significant changes that may occur which could impact the estimate of liability. Long-term debt related commitments Ferrellgas has long and short-term payment obligations under agreements such as the indentures governing its senior notes. See Note E Debt for a description of these debt obligations and a schedule of future maturities. Tax matters During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company received a tax assessment related to multiple years from a local taxing jurisdiction for underpaid use tax. We filed a Petition for Redetermination and Request for Reconsideration at the local tax administration office as we believed we had meritorious defenses. Subsequent to October 31, 2024, the Company entered into settlement discussions and accrued the loss contingency.

Any remaining undistributed net earnings will be allocated between the Class B Units and the Class A Units on a -to-one basis as if all undistributed earnings had been distributed to each class of units in accordance with their distribution rights. For any periods in which losses are recognized, no effect is given to the Class B Units as they do not contractually participate in the losses of Ferrellgas. In addition, Ferrellgas has the option to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Class B Units outstanding at any time on or prior to March 30, 2026 for cash. This call option does not impact the dilutive effect of net loss per Class A Unit due to the cash-only redemption provision, which is assumed, and therefore there would be no dilutive effect. events or transactions occurring during this period that required recognition or disclosure in its condensed consolidated financial statements, except for the subsequent event described in Note E Debt related to its Credit Agreement.

Its condensed financial statements were prepared under the assumption that it will continue as a going concern. On December 5, 2024, the maturity date was subsequently extended from March 30, 2025 to December 31, 2025, which alleviated the substantial doubt about Finance Corp. s ability to continue as a going concern at least one year from the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report. events or transactions occurring, except for the subsequent event described in Note B Contingencies and commitments related to its Credit Agreement.

 Overview Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners and the Preferred Unitholders are the only limited partners of the operating partnership. Ferrellgas, Inc. is the sole general partner of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership and, excluding the economic interests attributable to the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, owns an approximate 1 general partner economic interest in each, and, therefore, an effective 2 general partner economic interest in the operating partnership. Excluding the economic interests attributable to the Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners owns an approximate 99 limited partner interest in the operating partnership. For information regarding the economic and other terms of the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, see Note G Equity (Deficit) and Note F Preferred units to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our general partner performs all management functions for us. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, currently beneficially owns approximately 23.4 of our outstanding Class A units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100 by an employee stock ownership trust. The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. have nominal assets, do not conduct any operations and have no employees other than officers. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. has served as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of Ferrellgas Partners, while Ferrellgas Finance Corp., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of the operating partnership. Accordingly, and due to the reduced disclosure format, a discussion of the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. is not presented in this section. The Class A Units of Ferrellgas Partners are traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol FGPR. We file annual, quarterly, and current reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You may read and download our SEC filings over the Internet from several commercial document retrieval services as well as at the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings are also available on our website at www.ferrellgas.com at no cost as soon as reasonably practicable after our electronic filing or furnishing thereof with the SEC. Please note that any Internet addresses provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are for informational purposes only and are not intended to be hyperlinks. Accordingly, no information found and/or provided at such Internet addresses is intended or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein. The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 and in our unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussions set forth in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. How We Evaluate Our Operations We evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on a metric we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA, which is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our revenue generating assets have long useful lives. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the subheading Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

 Propane operations and related equipment sales Based on our propane sales volumes in fiscal 2024, we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operations primarily include the retail distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies. We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. Normal temperatures computed by us are the average of the last 10 years of information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA ). Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage. Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes primarily during the months of November through March (the winter heating season ). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and cash flow. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a continued warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and cash flow as well as impact our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. Our open financial derivative propane purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales commitments and, as of October 31, 2024, we have experienced net mark-to-market gains of approximately 6.9 million. Because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the resulting asset, liability and related mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Other assets, net, Other current liabilities, Other liabilities and Accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively, until settled. Upon settlement, realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to Cost of sales-propane and other gas liquid sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as the underlying inventory is sold. These financial derivative purchase commitment net gains are expected to be offset by decreased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. At October 31, 2024, we estimate 88 of currently open financial derivative purchase commitments, the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months.

 Summary Discussion of Results of Operations: Executive Overview For the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 During the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of 146.6 million and 17.5 million, respectively. The 129.1 million change was primarily driven by increases of 125.1 million in General and administrative expense primarily related to a legal accrual, 3.5 million in Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other and 1.9 million in Interest expense. After adjusting for 4.0 million in legal fees and settlements related to core businesses, we had a 0.5 million decrease in Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other. The 1.9 million increase in Interest expense is comprised of a 1.2 million increase for letters of credit fees and a 0.7 million increase for amortization of debt issuance costs related to the fiscal 2024 amendment to the Company s revolving credit facility. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors decreased to 3.4 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 8.0 million for the prior year period, primarily due to increases of 5.9 million in Maintenance capital expenditures and 1.7 million in Net cash interest expense, partially offset by a 2.9 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in Maintenance capital expenditures primarily relates to failed sale-leaseback arrangements and production plant upgrades. During the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a distributable cash flow shortage of 12.9 million and 8.4 million, respectively. This 4.5 million change was primarily due to the 4.6 million decrease in distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors noted above. Consolidated Results of Operations

Table of Contents 
 Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA for Ferrellgas Partners is calculated as net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., plus the sum of the following: income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash employee stock ownership plan compensation charge, loss on asset sales and disposals, other income, net, legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses, legal fees and settlements related to core businesses, business transformation costs, and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. Management believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful because it allows investors to view the partnership s performance in a manner similar to the method management uses, adjusted for items management believes make it easier to compare its results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Equity Investors . Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for income taxes, plus proceeds from certain asset sales. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors a meaningful measure of Ferrellgas ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to equity investors, including holders of the operating partnership s Preferred Units. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Class A and B Unitholders . Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors minus distributions accrued or paid to Preferred Unitholders and distributable cash flow attributable to general partner and noncontrolling interest. Management considers Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders a meaningful measure of the partnership s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to Class A and B Unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Shortage . Distributable cash flow shortage is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders minus Distributions paid to Class A and B Unitholders. Distributable cash flow excess, if any, is retained to establish reserves, to reduce debt, to fund capital expenditures and for other partnership purposes, and any shortage is funded from previously established reserves, cash on hand or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Management considers Distributable cash flow excess a meaningful measure of the partnership s ability to effectuate those purposes. Distributable cash flow shortage, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow shortage that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow shortage should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.

 Propane sales volumes during the three months ended October 31, 2024 decreased 4.2 million gallons, or 3 , compared to the prior year period. Average temperatures (measured by heating degree days) were 20 warmer than normal (based on NOAA s ten-year average) and 16 warmer than the prior year period during the three months ended October 31, 2024. In addition to warmer weather, severe weather events on small businesses resulting in their closings and the effects of inflation, contributed to a 3 decrease in retail customers compared to the prior year period, which also impacted sales volumes. Our wholesale sales price per gallon partially correlates to the change in the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market price at major supply points in Mt. Belvieu, Texas during the three months ended October 31, 2024 averaged the same as the prior year period, while at the Conway, Kansas major supply point prices averaged 4.4 more than the prior year period. The wholesale market price at Mt. Belvieu, Texas averaged 0.70 per gallon during the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, while the wholesale market price at Conway, Kansas averaged 0.71 and 0.68 per gallon during the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. However, in the Pacific Northwest region and some of the Mountain region in which we operate, prices averaged 2.7 less per gallon during the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to Los Angeles and the Bay Area pricing. These regional pricing differentials accounted for additional decreases in revenue noted below compared to the volume decrease. Revenues Retail sales decreased 12.6 million, or 6 , compared to the prior year period and correlates to the decrease in gallons sold of 7.7 million gallons, or 7 . Business closings due to severe weather events, the effects of inflation, and weather that was 16 warmer than the prior year quarter were all factors contributing to the decrease in retail gallons sold. As a nationwide logistics provider, we continue to expand our footprint outside of our midwest core, realizing organic growth in our customer base both in the west and southeast during the first fiscal quarter. Our business development team continues to deliver strategic opportunities, such as the acquisition of Kilhoffer Propane, located in Oklahoma, in October 2024. Our retail business also benefits from the strength of its national accounts team. Standing out from their wins this quarter are three key new national accounts, providing more than 700,000 gallons annually. Wholesale sales increased 8.3 million, or 8 , compared to the prior year period with a corresponding increase of 3.5 million gallons, or 7 , compared to the prior year period. The favorable increase was driven by an 8.8 million increase in tank exchange sales due to organic growth primarily driven by new customer wins. Storm preparation and response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton during the current year quarter also added growth. Tank exchange selling locations increased 9 compared to the prior year period as new major accounts accounted for the majority of the increase of approximately 5,500 tank exchange selling locations compared to the prior year period. Other gas sales increased 2.1 million, or 38 , compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in sales volume. Other revenues decreased 4.8 million, or 15 , compared to the prior year period. The change was primarily due to a decrease of 5.8 million in transport revenue, partially offset by an increase in miscellaneous revenues and fees. Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquids sales Gross margin increased 5.7 million as the 14.2 million increase in retail gross margin was partially offset by an 8.5 million decrease in wholesale gross margin. The overall change was driven by a 7.8 million decrease in cost of sales, which was partially offset by a 2.1 million decrease in revenue. Our telematics technology provides a platform under which we can manage our fleet to reduce fuel costs and boost route efficiencies such as reducing idling time, which drove the decrease in cost of sales as compared to the prior year period. Margin per gallon for the quarter increased by 0.06, or 6 , compared to the prior year period. The volume on our Platinum Plus fixed cost program for residential customers and national account wins as well as west coast gains were primary factors in margin improvement during the quarter. Gross margin - other Gross margin decreased 4.8 million, or 17 , compared to the prior year period.

 Operating (loss) income We had an operating loss of 122.9 million during the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to operating income of 5.1 million during the three months ended October 31, 2023. The 128.0 million change was primarily due to a 128.6 million increase in Operating, general and administrative expense, partially offset by the 0.9 million increase in gross margin noted above. The 128.6 million increase in Operating, general and administrative expense is comprised of increases of 125.1 million in General and administrative expense and 3.5 million increase in Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other. After adjusting for 4.0 million in legal fees and settlements related to core businesses, Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other decreased 0.5 million. After adjusting for increases of 126.3 million in legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses and 0.4 million for business transformation activities, General and administrative expense decreased 1.6 million. See Note L Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information on a 125.0 million legal accrual. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.9 million primarily due to a decrease of 2.2 million in Operating, general and administrative expense, after adjusting for an increase of 130.8 million in EBITDA adjustments, and a 0.9 million increase in gross margin as described above. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operating activities, our Credit Facility and funds received from sales of debt and equity securities. The operating partnership, the general partner and certain of the operating partnership s subsidiaries as guarantors are parties to a credit agreement dated March 30, 2021, as amended on July 2, 2024 (the Credit Agreement ), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders and issuing lenders party thereto from time to time, which provides for a four-year revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), with a maturity date of March 30, 2025, in an aggregate principal amount of up to 350.0 million. The Credit Agreement includes a sublimit not to exceed 300.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. On December 5, 2024, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date from March 30, 2025 to December 31, 2025. On March 31, 2025, in conjunction with the commencement of the Fifth Amendment, the commitment level for the credit facility will be reduced from 350.0 million to 308.8 million. For additional discussion, see Note E Debt in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. As of October 31, 2024, our total liquidity was 163.5 million, which was comprised of 37.0 million in unrestricted cash and 126.5 million of availability under our Credit Facility. These sources of liquidity and short-term capital resources are intended to fund our working capital requirements, acquisitions and capital expenditures. As of October 31, 2024, letters of credit outstanding totaled 200.6 million. Our access to long-term capital resources, to the extent needed to refinance debt or for other purposes, may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, covenants in our debt agreements and other financial obligations, unforeseen demands on cash, or other events beyond our control. As of October 31, 2024, we had 10.6 million of restricted cash consisting of a cash deposit made with the administrative agent under our prior senior secured credit facility that was terminated in April 2020.

 Our working capital requirements are subject to, among other things, the price of propane, delays in the collection of receivables, volatility in energy commodity prices, liquidity imposed by insurance providers, downgrades in our credit ratings, decreased trade credit, significant acquisitions, the weather, customer retention and purchasing patterns and other changes in the demand for propane. Relatively colder weather or higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements. Our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing weather, economic, financial and business conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business, a significant portion of our propane operations and related products cash flows from operations is generated during the winter heating season. Our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts. Historically, we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to the seasonality of our propane operations and related equipment sales operations. During periods of high volatility, our risk management activities may expose us to the risk of counterparty margin calls in amounts greater than we have the capacity to fund. Likewise, our counterparties may not be able to fulfill their margin calls from us or may default on the settlement of positions with us. Due to the timing of the March 30, 2025 maturity date of the Credit Facility noted above and the letters of credit which it secures, there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of the Company s fiscal 2024 Annual Report. Our condensed financial statements were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. As noted above, the maturity date was subsequently extended to December 31, 2025, which alleviated the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern at least one year from the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report. Therefore, we believe that the liquidity available from cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash and the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and letter of credit requirements for the foreseeable future. Distributable Cash Flow Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is reconciled to net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the subheading Non-GAAP Financial Measures above. A comparison of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors to cash distributions accrued or paid to equity investors for the twelve months ended October 31, 2024 to the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 is as follows (in thousands): 

Cash reserves Distributable (deficiency) Cash distributions cash flow attributable approved by our accrued or paid to DCF to equity investors General Partner equity investors ratio (1) Three months ended October 31, 2024 3,403 (12,829) 16,232 Fiscal 2024 212,265 147,487 64,778 Less: Three months ended October 31, 2023 7,973 (8,278) 16,251 Twelve months ended October 31, 2024 207,695 142,936 64,759 3.2x Twelve months ended July 31, 2024 212,265 147,487 64,778 3.3x Change (4,570) (4,551) (19) (0.1)x 
 (1) DCF ratio is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors divided by Cash distributions accrued or paid to equity investors. 
 For the twelve months ended October 31, 2024, distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors decreased 4.6 million compared to the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 primarily due to increases of 5.9 million in Maintenance capital expenditures and 1.7 million in Net cash interest expense, partially offset by a 2.9 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in Maintenance capital expenditures relates to failed sale-leaseback arrangements and production plant upgrades. As of October 31, 2024, the accrued quarterly distribution to Preferred Unitholders was 18.1 million. We paid 15.4 million of this distribution on November 15, 2024. The remaining 2.7 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units, pursuant to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment.

 We did not pay any cash distributions to our Class A Unitholders or the general partner during the three months ended October 31, 2024 or 2023. We have made aggregate cash distributions of approximately 250.0 million to our Class B Unitholders since inception of our Class B Units. Under its Credit Agreement, Ferrellgas Partners is currently unable to make distributions to its Class A and Class B unitholders. See Note E "Debt" for more information. Cash reserves, which we utilize to meet future anticipated expenditures, were 142.9 million and 147.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. Operating Activities Ferrellgas Partners Net cash used in operating activities was 34.3 million and 18.9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 15.4 million increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a 130.1 million decrease in cash flow from operations and a 23.3 million increase in working capital requirements. These changes were partially offset by a 130.9 million decrease in requirements for other current liabilities. The 130.1 million decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to an increase of 125.1 million in General and administrative expense related to a legal accrual, as described in Note L Contingencies and commitments. The 23.3 million increase in working capital requirements was primarily due to a 27.5 million increase in requirements for accounts and notes receivable, net. This was partially offset by decreases of 2.7 million in inventory requirements and 1.5 million in requirements for accounts payable. The 130.9 million decrease in net cash requirements for other current liabilities was primarily driven by the legal accrual, as described above. The operating partnership The operating activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. Investing Activities Ferrellgas Partners Capital Requirements Our business requires continual investments to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Capital expenditures for our business consist primarily of: Maintenance capital expenditures - These capital expenditures include expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment, and may from time to time include the purchase of assets that are typically leased, rather than to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures include a routine replacement of a worn-out asset or replacement of major vehicle components; and Growth capital expenditures - These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples include expenditures for purchases of both bulk and portable propane tanks and other equipment to facilitate expansion of our customer base and operating capacity. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 25.1 million and 23.1 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2.0 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 3.7 million increase in Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by a 1.5 million decrease in Capital expenditures as our tank exchange brand s supply chain initiatives reduced the need for cylinder purchases. We had one acquisition during the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to none during the three months ended October 31, 2023. Due to the mature nature of our operations, we do not anticipate significant fluctuations in maintenance capital expenditures, with the exception of future decisions regarding lease versus buy financing options. However, future fluctuations in growth capital expenditures could occur due to the opportunistic nature of these projects.

 The operating partnership The investing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. Financing Activities Ferrellgas Partners Net cash used in financing activities was 17.1 million and 18.6 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 1.5 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of 2.9 million in Other, net, which was primarily related to the liability related to failed sale-leaseback arrangements. On July 10, 2024, letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount of 124.5 million were issued to the surety providers under an appeal bond posted on behalf of Ferrellgas Partners. See Note L Contingencies and commitments to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Letters of credit were also used to secure insurance arrangements, product purchases and commodity hedges. Letters of credit outstanding at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 totaled 200.6 and 193.4 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2024, we had available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility of 126.5 million. Assets subject to lien under the Credit Facility were 333.3 million as of October 31, 2024. The operating partnership The financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. Distributions Partnership distributions The Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA requires Ferrellgas Partners to make quarterly cash distributions of all of its available cash . Available cash is defined in the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA as, generally, the sum of Ferrellgas Partners cash receipts less consolidated cash disbursements and net changes in reserves established by our general partner for future requirements. In general, the amount of Ferrellgas Partners available cash depends primarily on whether and the extent to which Ferrellgas Partners receives cash distributions from the operating partnership, as such distributions generally would be Ferrellgas Partners only significant cash receipts. The Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas, L.P. (the Amended OpCo LPA ), which amended and restated in its entirety the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas L.P., and a First Amendment to the Amended OpCo LPA (the OpCo LPA Amendment ), sets forth the preferences, rights, privileges and other terms of the Preferred Units. Pursuant to the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, any distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners must be made such that the ratio of (i) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class B Units to (ii) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class A Units and the general partner is not less than 6:1. The Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA permits Ferrellgas Partners, in the general partner s discretion, to make distributions to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio, including paying 100 of any such distribution to Class B Unitholders. The Class B Units will not be convertible into Class A Units until Class B Unitholders receive distributions in the aggregate amount of 357.0 million, which was the 357.0 million aggregate principal amount of Ferrellgas Partners unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2020 (the Ferrellgas Partners Notes ), and the rate at which Class B Units will convert into Class A Units increases annually. Additionally, the price at which Ferrellgas Partners may redeem the Class B Units during the first five years after March 30, 2021 is based on the Class B Unitholders receipt of a specified internal rate of return in respect of their Class B Units. This specified internal rate of return in respect of the Class B Units is 15.85 , but that amount increases under certain circumstances, including if the operating partnership paid distributions on the Preferred Units in-kind rather than in cash for a certain number of quarters. Accordingly, distributing cash to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio could result in the Class B Units becoming convertible into Class A Units more quickly or at a lower conversion rate or reduce the redemption price for the Class B Units. For additional discussion of the terms of the Class B Units, see Note G Equity (Deficit) in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

 For these reasons, although the general partner has not made any decisions or adopted any policy with respect to the allocation of future distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners, the general partner may determine that it is advisable to pay more than the minimum amount of any distribution, up to 100 of the amount of such distribution, to Class B Unitholders. We have made aggregate cash distributions of approximately 250.0 million to our Class B Unitholders since inception of our Class B Units. Under its Credit Agreement, Ferrellgas Partners is currently unable to make distributions to its Class A and Class B unitholders. See Note E "Debt" and Note M "Net loss per Unitholders' interest" for additional information. See Risk Factors Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements If Ferrellgas Partners is permitted to make and makes distributions to its partners, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class B Unitholders collectively will receive at least approximately 85.7 of the aggregate amount of each such distribution and may receive up to 100 of any such distribution. Accordingly, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class A Unitholders may not receive any distributions and, in any case, will not receive collectively more than approximately 14.1 of any distribution in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024. Ferrellgas Partners did not pay any distributions to Class A Unitholders, Class B Unitholders or the general partner during the three months ended October 31, 2024 or 2023. The ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make cash distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders is dependent on the receipt by Ferrellgas Partners of cash distributions from the operating partnership. For so long as any Preferred Units remain outstanding, the amount of cash that otherwise would be available for distribution by the operating partnership to Ferrellgas Partners will be reduced by the amount of cash distributions and other payments made by the operating partnership in respect of the Preferred Units, including payments to redeem Preferred Units. Further, the indentures governing the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes (together with the 2026 Notes, the OpCo Notes ), the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment governing the Preferred Units contain covenants that limit the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to Ferrellgas Partners and therefore effectively limit the ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders. See Note E Debt and Note F Preferred units for a discussion of these limitations. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024, see also Risk Factors Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements Restrictive covenants in the Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the agreements governing our other future indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility and ability to make cash distributions to holders of Class A Units and Class B Units. The Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment contain important exceptions to these covenants. Preferred unit distributions Pursuant to the OpCo LPA Amendment, the operating partnership is required to pay to the holders of each Preferred Unit a cumulative, quarterly distribution (the Quarterly Distribution at the Distribution Rate (as defined below) on the unit purchase price of such Preferred Unit, which is 1,000 per unit. Distribution Rate means, for the first five years after March 30, 2021, a rate per annum equal to 8.956 , with certain increases in the Distribution Rate on each of the 5 th , 6 th and 7 th anniversaries of March 30, 2021, subject to a maximum rate of 11.125 and certain other adjustments and exceptions. The Quarterly Distribution may be paid in cash or, at the election of the operating partnership, in kind through the issuance of additional Preferred Units PIK Units at the quarterly Distribution Rate plus an applicable premium that escalates each year from 75 bps to 300 bps so long as the Preferred Units remain outstanding. In the event the operating partnership fails to make any Quarterly Distribution in cash, such Quarterly Distribution will automatically be paid in PIK Units. The Distribution Rate on the Preferred Units will increase upon violation of certain protective provisions for the benefit of Preferred Unitholders notwithstanding the cap mentioned above. As of October 31, 2024, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was 18.1 million. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, one quarterly payment of 15.4 million relating to Quarterly Distributions was paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrual of 2.7 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment. 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 As of October 31, 2023, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was 18.0 million. During the three months ended October 31, 2023, one quarterly payment of 15.4 relating to Quarterly Distributions was paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrued of 2.6 million represented Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters. Preferred unit tax distributions For any quarter in which the operating partnership makes a Quarterly Distribution in PIK Units in lieu of cash, it shall make a subsequent cash tax distribution for such quarter in an amount equal to the (i) the lesser of (x) 25 and (y) the highest combined federal, state and local tax rate applicable for corporations organized in New York, multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) one-fourth (1/4th) of the estimated taxable income to be allocated to the holders of Preferred Units for the year in which the Quarterly Tax Payment Date (which refers to certain specified dates that next follow a Quarterly Distribution date on which PIK Units were issued) occurs, over (B) any cash paid on the Quarterly Distribution date immediately preceding the Quarterly Tax Payment Date on which a quarterly tax amount would otherwise be paid (such amount, the Tax Distribution ). Tax Distributions are treated as advances against, and reduce, future cash distributions for any reason, including payments in redemption of Preferred Units or PIK Units, or payments to the holders in their capacity as such pursuant to any side letter or other agreement. Cash distributions paid Ferrellgas Partners did not pay any cash distributions to its Class A Unitholders, Class B Unitholders or the general partner during the three months ended October 31, 2024 or 2023. The operating partnership paid cash distributions for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 in respect of its Preferred Units as discussed above under Preferred unit distributions. The operating partnership The financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties We have no employees and are managed and controlled by our general partner. Pursuant to our partnership agreements, our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf, and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business. These reimbursable costs, which totaled 86.4 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024, include operating expenses such as compensation and benefits paid to employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf as well as related general and administrative expenses. During the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the operating partnership paid distributions to Ferrellgas Partners as described above. Material Cash Requirements As of October 31, 2024, there have been no material changes to our material cash requirements from those described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Material Cash Requirements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, see Note E Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The operating partnership The contractual obligations discussed above also apply to the operating partnership.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We did not enter into any risk management trading activities during the three months ended October 31, 2024. Our remaining market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading. Commodity price risk management Our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical products market in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets. Our propane related financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Our risk management activities include the use of financial derivative instruments including, but not limited to, futures, swaps, and options to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses. We enter into these financial derivative instruments with brokers who are clearing members with the Intercontinental Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and, to a lesser extent, directly with third parties in the over-the-counter market. We also enter into forward propane purchase and sales contracts with counterparties. These forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception within GAAP guidance and are therefore not recorded on our financial statements until settled. Risk Policy and Sensitivity Analysis Market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy. This policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts. We also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk, so as to manage exposures to changing market prices. We have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions. Forward contracts, futures, swaps and options outstanding as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities. The potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a 10 adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at 12.8 million and 10.0 million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. The preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal 10 , thus actual results may differ. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the anticipated transactions associated with these transactions, which we anticipate will be 100 effective. Credit risk We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe significantly reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition (including credit ratings), and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit guidelines. Our other counterparties principally consist of major energy companies that are suppliers, marketers, wholesalers, retailers and end users; and major U.S. financial institutions. The overall impact due to certain changes in economic, regulatory and other events may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively in that counterparties may be similarly impacted. Based on our policies, exposures, credit and other reserves, management does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty performance.

 Interest rate risk We had variable rate indebtedness outstanding related to our letters of credit under our Credit Facility of 200.6 million and 193.4 million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates to the extent that we have variable rate indebtedness (including any disbursements or payments related to letters of credit) outstanding under our Credit Facility. Critical accounting estimates Our critical accounting estimates are disclosed under Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2024. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, no modifications were made to these critical accounting estimates. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES An evaluation was performed by the management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective as of October 31, 2024. The management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Based on the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the above mentioned partnerships and corporations have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Therefore, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurances of achieving our desired control objectives, and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner have concluded, as of October 31, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in achieving that level of reasonable assurance. During the most recent fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
