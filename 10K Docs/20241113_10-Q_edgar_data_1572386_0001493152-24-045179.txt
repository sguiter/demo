The
Company has cash on hand of at September 30, 2024. The Company does not expect to generate sufficient revenues or positive cash
flows from operations sufficiently to meet its current obligations. However, the Company may seek to raise debt or equity-based capital
at favorable terms, though such terms are not certain. 

These
factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent
to the date that these financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes
the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business.

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. 

Although
the Company believes that the recorded fair value of its financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative
of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. 

The
Company s financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses
 related parties, advances and various debt instruments are carried at historical cost. 

At September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximated their fair values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. 

ASC
825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value fair value option ). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable
unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument,
should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding
financial instruments. 

. However, Greenway never transferred the G-Reformer to
OPMGE, as required by the LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF OPM GREEN ENERGY, LLC. Accordingly, it defaulted on its obligation under
the agreement. Since the Wharton Plant is owned by Mabert, OPMGE was no longer a viable entity as of September 30, 2024. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no assets within OPMGE. Accordingly, the Company s receivable with this entity is fully
reserved for as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and
2023 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to those Financial Statements that are included
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and were prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our discussion includes forward-looking
statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions.
Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result
of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Risk Factors, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements and Description of Business sections and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We use words such as anticipate, 
 estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, 
 believe, intend, may, will, should, could, predict, 
and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking
statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, our actual results could differ materially
from those discussed in these statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason
even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. 

Information
regarding market and industry statistics contained in this Report is included based on information available to us that we believe is
accurate. Much of this general market information is based on industry trade journals, articles and other publications that are not produced
for purposes of SEC filings or economic analysis. We have not reviewed nor included data from all possible sources and cannot assure
investors of the accuracy or completeness of any such data that is included in this Report. Forecasts and other forward-looking information
obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and the additional uncertainties accompanying any estimates of future
market size, revenue and market acceptance of our services. As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources, should be read in
conjunction with our Annual Form 10-K filed on July 16, 2024. As discussed in Note 1 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements,
our recurring net losses and inability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations and sustain our operations raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters are also discussed in Note
1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties,
including information with respect to our plans, intentions and strategies for our businesses. Our actual results may differ materially
from those estimated or projected in any of these forward-looking statements. 

In
this Form 10-Q, we, our, us, the Company and similar terms in this report, including
references to UMED and Greenway all refer to Greenway Technologies, Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise. 

Overview 

We
are engaged in the research and development of proprietary gas-to-liquids GTL synthesis gas Syngas conversion systems and micro-plants that can be scaled to meet specific gas field production requirements. Our patented and proprietary
technologies have been realized in our first commercial G-Reformer TM unit G-Reformer ), a unique component
used to convert natural gas into Syngas, which when combined with a Fischer-Tropsch FT reactor and catalyst, produces
fuels including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and methanol. G-Reformer units can be deployed to process a variety of natural gas streams
including pipeline gas, associated gas, flared gas, vented gas, coal-bed methane and/or biomass gas. When derived from any of these natural
gas sources, the liquid fuels created are incrementally cleaner than conventionally produced oil-based fuels. Our Company s objective
is to become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized diesel and jet fuels, with a near -term focus on U.S.
market opportunities. For more information about our Company, please visit our website located at https://gwtechinc.com/ .

Our
GTL Technology 

In
August 2012, we acquired 100 of GIE, pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement, by and between us and GIE, dated August 29, 2012,
and filed as Exhibit 10.5, and incorporated by reference herein (the GIE Acquisition Agreement ). GIE owns patents
and trade secrets for a proprietary technology to convert natural gas into Syngas. Based on a new, breakthrough process called Fractional
Thermal Oxidation FTO ), we believe that the G-Reformer, combined with conventional FT processes, offers
an economical and scalable method to converting natural gas to liquid fuel. On February 15, 2013, GIE filed for its first patent on this
GTL technology, resulting in the issue of U.S. Patent 8,574,501 B1 on November 5, 2013. On November 4, 2013, GIE filed for a second patent
covering other unique aspects of the design and was issued U.S. Patent 8,795,597 B2 on August 5, 2014. The Company has several other
pending patent applications, both domestic and international, related to various components and processes relating to our proprietary
GTL methods, complementing our existing portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications. 

On
June 26, 2017, we and The University of Texas at Arlington UTA announced that we had successfully demonstrated
our GTL technology at our sponsored Conrad Greer Laboratory at UTA, proving the viability of the science behind the technology. 

On
March 6, 2018, we announced the completion of our first commercial scale G-Reformer, a critical component in what we call the Greer-Wright
GTL system. The G-Reformer is the critical component of the Company s innovative GTL system . A team consisting of individuals
from our Company, UTA and our Company s contracted G-Reformer manufacturer worked together to test and calibrate the newly built
G-Reformer unit. The testing substantiated the units Syngas generation capability and demonstrated additional proficiencies within
certain proprietary prior prescribed testing metrics. 

On
July 23, 2019, we announced that Mabert LLC, a Texas limited liability company Mabert ), 100 owned by Kevin Jones,
acquired INFRA Technology Group s U.S. GTL plant and technology located in Wharton, Texas (the Wharton Plan t ).
Mabert purchased the entire 5.2-acre site, plant and equipment, including INFRA s proprietary FT reactor system and operating license
agreement. 

On
August 29, 2019, to further facilitate the commercialization process, we announced that Greenway entered into a joint venture with OPM
Green Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company OPMGE ), for a 42.857 ownership interest in OPMGE. In exchange
for its 42.857 ownership of OPMGE, Greenway agreed to contribute a G-Reformer to the entity. The other members of OPMGE are Mabert,
which owns 42.857 and Tom Phillips, our former Vice President of Operations for GIE, who owns 14.286 . Additionally, OPMGE entered a
LEASE AGREEMENT with Mabert whereby OPMGE leased the Wharton Plant from Mabert. Our involvement in OPMGE was intended to facilitate third-party
certification of our G-Reformer and related equipment and technology. In addition, we anticipated that OPMGE s operations would
demonstrate that the G-Reformer is a commercially viable technology for producing Syngas and marketable fuel products. As the first operating
GTL plant to use our proprietary reforming technology and equipment, the Wharton Plant was initially expected to yield a minimum of 75
- 100 barrels per day of gasoline and diesel fuels from converted natural gas. 

Greenway
never transferred the G-Reformer to OPMGE, as required by the LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF OPM GREEN ENERGY, LLC. Accordingly,
it defaulted on its obligation under the agreement. Under the LEASE AGREEMENT between Mabert and OPMGE, OPMGE was required to pay rent
and to pay the following expenses relating to the operation of the Wharton Plant: 

Utilities 

Trash
 removal and lawn maintenance 

Taxes 

Insurance 

Maintenance,
 Repairs or Alterations 

The
lease stated that this transaction was a Triple Net Lease. 

If
OPMG did not pay rent or the other expenses outlined above, it represented Events of Default, which allowed Mabert the right to terminate
the lease. Based on the Events of Default that occurred, Mabert exercised its right to terminate the lease. 

On
April 28, 2020, the Company was issued a new U.S. Patent 10,633,594 B1 for syngas generation for gas-to-liquid fuel conversion. The Company
has several other pending patent applications, both domestic and international, related to various components and processes involving
our proprietary GTL methods, which when granted, will further complement our existing portfolio of issued patents and pending patent
applications. 

25 

On
December 8, 2020, the Company announced an exclusive worldwide patent licensing agreement with UTA
for all patent applications currently filed with the Patent and Trademark Office relating to GWTI s natural gas reforming technologies
developed under its sponsored research agreement with UTA. 

On
December 15, 2020, the Company announced additional information regarding valuable outputs produced by the company s proprietary
G-Reformer catalyst reactor and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology which combine to form the Greer-Wright 
GTL solution. Originally developed to convert natural gas into ultra-clean synthetic fuel, recent research and development activity has
shown that the technology can also allow the extraction of high-value chemicals and alcohols. The chemical outputs include n-Hexane,
n-Heptane, n-Octane, n-Decane, n-Dodecane, and n-Tridecane. Alcohols produced include ethanol and methanol. The company has identified
worldwide industrial demand for these outputs which will significantly improve the economic return on investment (ROI) of GTL plants
that are based on GWTI s technology. GWTI is a development-stage company with plans to commercialize its unique and patented technology. 

Ultimately,
we believe that our proprietary G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial tests have demonstrated
that our Company s solution appears to be superior to legacy technologies, which are more costly, have a larger footprint, and
cannot be easily deployed at field sites to process associated gas, stranded gas, coal-bed methane, vented gas, or flared gas. 

The
technology for the G-Reformer is unique, because it permits for transportable (mobile) GTL plants with much smaller footprints, compared
to legacy large-scale technologies. Thus, we believe that our technologies and processes will allow for multiple small-scale GTL plants
to be built with substantially lower up-front and ongoing costs, resulting in more profitable results for oil and gas operators. 

GTL
Industry Market 

GTL
converts natural gas the cleanest-burning fossil fuel into high-quality liquid products that would otherwise be made
from crude oil. These products include transport fuels, motor oils, and the ingredients for everyday necessities like plastics, detergents,
and cosmetics. GTL products are colorless, odorless, and contain almost none of the impurities, (e.g., sulphur, aromatics, and nitrogen)
that are found in crude oil. 

Our
Company has developed a revolutionary and unique process that converts natural gas of various origins and compositions into a highly
pure variety of chemicals, high cetane diesel fuel, industrial grade pure water and electrical energy. GTL technology has existed as
a traditional process going back generations. This process consists of two steps. First, natural gas is converted into Synthesis Gas
(Syngas) which is a non-naturally occurring blend of Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide. The front-end part of the GTL process is called Gas
Reformation . The output of the Gas Reformer is compressed and fed through a secondary process, called Fischer-Tropsch (FT). This
secondary process is widely used in many forms in the chemical and oil industries. While FT is a common process, Gas Reformation has
been the most difficult step beyond an old and traditional process typically used in refineries. The invention of our software-controlled
GTL process fronted by our patented and revolutionary gas reformation unit, the G-Reformer , makes us the innovator in GTL technology.
Our patents are based on scalability, transportability, flexibility and self-sustainment based on a wide variety of input gasses and
output mixtures. 

The
Company s process is made of small sized modularly scalable units which are portable and self-contained unlike other GTL solutions
based on Steam Methane reformation. While many companies have tried to scale Steam Methane Reformation down for use in smaller, non-refinery
based GTL plants, they have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, we can build self-sufficient GTL plants at virtually any location
capable of supplying wellhead or pipeline gas of sufficient ongoing volume. This gives us the ability to eliminate flaring at the source
while keeping remote oil fields in production without flaring. The conversion of flaring gas to liquid allows trucks to easily move liquid
chemicals, clean diesel fuel, highly clean water and the power grid to move electricity from virtually any location. 

Our
initial ROI studies of the market for high purity chemicals we produce can provide incredibly rapid payback of investments. It should
be noted the vast majority of these chemicals produced are made in China. Further, because they originate from a barrel of oil at a refinery,
they are much lower in purity. 

Products
created by the GTL process include High Cetane Diesel, Naphtha, Technical Grade Water, and high value, high purity chemicals. The chemicals
which would be produced in the GTL plant would be vital to many industries including pharmaceutical, cosmetics, fragrances, adhesives,
and others. The vast majority of these chemicals are produced in China. Such dependency makes America captive to shortfalls whether they
are manufacturing related or intentional. By making these chemicals in the USA, we reduce that dependency and keep the product, the jobs,
and the profits in America. 

26 

Development
of stringent environmental regulations by numerous governments to control pollution and promote cleaner fuel sources is expected to complement
industry growth. For example, we believe that U.S. guidelines such as the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 2006, Oilfields
(Regulation and Development) Act of 1948, and Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974 are likely to continue to encourage GTL applications
in diverse end-use industries to conserve natural gas and other resources. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA sets limits on certain
air pollutants, including setting limits on how much can be in the air anywhere in the United States. The Clean Air Act also gives EPA
the authority to limit emissions of air pollutants coming from sources like chemical plants, refineries, utilities, and steel mills.
Individual states or tribes may have stronger air pollution laws, but they may not have weaker pollution limits than those set by EPA.
Because our G-Reformer based GTL plants are not considered refineries, they do not fall under any related current EPA air quality guidelines.
More information can be found under the EPA s New Source Performance Standards which are published under 40 CFR 60. 

Competition 

Key
industry players include: Chevron Corporation; KBR Inc, PetroSA, Qatar Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell; and Sasol Limited. In terms of global
production and consumption, Shell had the largest market share in 2021, with virtually all current production located overseas. Our technology
is not designed to compete with the large refinery-size GTL plants operated by such large industry operators. Our plants are designed
to be scaled to meet individual gas field production requirements on a distributed and mobile basis. According to a report released in
July 2019 by the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership GGFRP ), there are currently only 5 small-scale GTL plant technologies
that have been proven and are now available for flared gas monetization available in the U.S., including: Greyrock Flare to Fuels 
Advantage Midstream (licensing Greyrock technology); EFT Flare Buster Primus GE and GasTechno Methanol in a
Box ). We were not a direct part of this study, as we had not received 3rd party certification of our proprietary technology as
of the date of this report. 

However,
the GGFRP report mentioned us as follows, Greenway Technologies announced on July 23 that Mabert LLC, a major investor in Greenway,
acquired the whole INFRA plant including an operating license agreement. The purpose of the acquisition is the incorporation and commercial
demonstration of Greenway s G-Reformer technology. We will see whether the new team will be able to make the plant
with the new reformer operational. (Globe Newswire, Fort Worth, Texas, Aug 31, 2019). 

Mining
Interests 

In
December 2010, UMED acquired the rights to approximately 1,440 acres of placer mining claims located on Bureau of Land Management BLM land in Mohave County, Arizona (such property, the Arizona Property ), in an Assignment Agreement dated December
27, 2010, and filed as Exhibit 10.31, between Melek Mining, Inc., 4HM Partners, Inc. and the Company, in exchange for 5,066,000 shares
of our common stock. Early indications from samples taken and processed by Melek Mining provided reason to believe that the potential
recovery value of the metals located on the Arizona Property could be significant, but only actual mining and processing will determine
the ultimate value that may be realized from this property holding. While we are not currently conducting mining operations, we are exploring
strategic options to partner or sell our interest in the Arizona Property, while we focus on our emerging GTL technology sales and marketing
efforts. 

Employees 

As
of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, we have three (3) full-time employees.
One of these employees does not have an employment agreement and receives no compensation. The other two (2) employees have employment agreements.
Payment under the employment agreements are paid from time-to-time, when the Company has sufficient funding. None of our employees are
covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 

Going
Concern 

We
remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm
issued a going concern qualification in its report dated July 16, 2024 and filed with our annual report on Form 10-K, which is included
by reference to our consolidated Financial Statements and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

1
 Our net loss decreased by 81,321, due to a decrease in total operating expenses of 80,540. 

The
decrease was related primarily to a decrease in legal expenses of 107,772, a decrease in expenses on mining leases of 34,093, a decrease
of 15,000 in SEC filing and compliance expense and a decrease in professional fees of 23,500 due to the fact that the Company did not
contract with a third-party consultant to assist with the preparation of SEC filings. These decreases were offset by increases of 55,976
of consulting fees and 8,400 for our stock quoting service. 

2-
Our net cash used in operations decreased due to a decrease in net loss of 81,321, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses
of 98,356 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related party of 32,759. 

27 

3
 The increase in our working capital deficit resulted primarily from an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 242,647
and increase accounts payable and accrued expenses related parties of 603,951. 

4
 The increase in stockholders deficit is related to our increase in net loss. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total liabilities in excess of assets by 12,730,507
and used net cash of 256,028 for our operating activities. This is as compared to the most recent year ended December 31, 2023, when
we used net cash of 302,663 for operating activities. 

These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Financial Statements included in our Form 10-Q do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient new cash flows to meet our obligations
on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and/or ultimately to attain profitable operations. However, there
is no assurance that profitable operations, financing, or sufficient new cash flows will occur in the future. 

Our
ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to finance, manufacture, and market/operate GTL units. Our growth is dependent
on attaining profit from our operations and our raising additional capital either through the sale of our Common Stock or borrowing.
There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any equity financing or sell any of our products at a profit. We will be unable to
pay our obligations in the normal course of business or service our debt in a timely manner throughout 2024 without raising
additional debt or equity capital. There can be no assurance that we will raise additional debt or equity capital. 

We
are currently evaluating strategic alternatives that include (i) raising new equity capital and/or (ii) issuing additional debt instruments.
The process is ongoing, lengthy and has inherent costs. There can be no assurance that the exploration of these strategic alternatives
will result in any specific action to alleviate our 12-month working capital needs or result in any other transaction. 

While
we are attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily
operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our securities. Management believes that the actions
presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going
concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, we may
not be successful. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to further implement our business plan
and generate revenues.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We do not currently have sufficient working capital
to fund our expected future operations. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to continue our operations without securing additional
adequate funding. As of September 30, 2024, we had 115,434 in cash, total assets of 115,434, and total liabilities of 12,845,941. Our
total accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024 was 38,962,230. 

Liquidity is
the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet all of its financial obligations. The following table provides certain

Our
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our general business strategy is to first develop our GTL technology
to maintain our basic viability, while seeking significant development capital for full commercialization. 

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of 38,962,230 and 37,462,816 as
of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on our ability to
obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. 

Seasonality 

We
do not anticipate that our business will be affected by seasonal factors. 

Employment

Pursuant
to the GIE Acquisition Agreement in August 2012, we agreed to: (i) issue an additional 7,500,000 shares of Common Stock when the first
portable GTL unit is built and becomes operational, and is capable of producing 2,000 barrels of diesel or jet fuel per day, and (ii)
pay a 2 royalty on all gross production sales on each unit placed in production, or one percent (1 each to the founders and previous
owners of GIE. On February 6, 2018, and in connection with a settlement agreement dated April 5, 2018, by and between the Greer Family
Trust and us, which is the successor in interest one of the founders and prior owners of GIE, F. Conrad Greer Greer ),
(the Trust , and such settlement agreement the Trust Settlement Agreement ), we issued 3,000,000
shares of Common Stock and a convertible promissory note for 150,000 to the Trust in exchange for: (i) a termination of the Trust s
right to receive 3,750,000 shares of Common Stock in the future and 1 of the royalties owed to the Trust under the GIE Acquisition Agreement;
(ii) the termination of Greer s then current employment agreement with GIE; and (iii) the Trust s waiver of any future claims

a result of the transactions consummated by the Trust Settlement Agreement, we are committed to issue a reduced number of 3,750,000 shares
of Common Stock and 1 of the royalties due on production of our GTL operational units to Ray Wright, the other founder and prior owner
of GIE, pursuant to the GIE Acquisition Agreement.

Impact
of Inflation 

While
we are subject to general inflationary trends, including for basic manufacturing production materials, our management believes that inflation
in and of itself does not have a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation may become a factor in the future. However,
the COVID-19 virus and its current extraordinary impact on the world economy has reduced oil consumption globally, decreasing crude oil
prices, to levels not seen since the early 1980 s. The economics of GTL conversion rely in part on the arbitrage between oil and
natural gas prices, with economic models for many producers, including our own models, using a range of 30-60/bbl (for WTI or Brent
Crude as listed daily on the Nymex and ICE commodities exchanges) to determine relative profitability of their GTL operations. While
the COVID-19 virus may run its human course in the near term, we believe (as many others in the U.S. government and media believe), that
the economic impacts will be long lasting and for all practical matters, remain largely unknown at this time.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). Preparing our Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application
of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets. 

We
evaluate our long-lived assets for financial impairment on a regular basis in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , which evaluates the recoverability of long-lived
assets not held for sale by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated discounted future cash flows associated
with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future discounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient
to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. 

We
believe that the critical accounting policies discussed above affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of our financial statements. 

Use
of Estimates 

Preparing
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material. 

Changes
in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other
assumptions, which include both quantitative and qualitative assessments that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. 

Significant
estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, include valuation of stock-based compensation, uncertain
tax positions, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents and Concentration of Credit Risk 

For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less
at the purchase date and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company did not have any cash equivalents. 

The
Company is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent
account balances exceed the amount insured by the FDIC, which is 250,000. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,
the Company did not have any cash in excess of the insured FDIC limit. 

33 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income tax using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes . Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The
Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 Income Taxes . Using
that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position
will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company
had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. 

The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. No interest and penalties related
to uncertain income tax positions were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Research
and Development 

The
Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with ASC subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ASC 730-10 ). 

Under
ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or
as milestone results have been achieved as defined under the applicable agreement. Company-sponsored research and development costs related
to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. 

The
Company incurred research and development expenses of 25,000 and 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation using the fair
value-based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized
over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions
in which an entity exchanges it equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities
in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of those equity instruments. 

The
Company uses the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes or other acceptable binomial
models for measuring the fair value of options. 

The
fair value of stock-based compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services
is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods. 

When
determining fair value, the Company considers the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes model: 

Exercise price, 

Expected dividends, 

Expected volatility, 

Risk-free interest rate; and 

Expected life of option 

Basic
and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share 

Pursuant
to ASC 260-10-45, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common
shares may consist of common stock issuable for stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes and common
stock issuable. These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future. 

At
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the Company had the following common stock equivalents outstanding, which are potentially
dilutive equity securities: 

September 30, 2024 
 September 30, 2023 
 
 Convertible debt 
 4,345,900 
 3,969,875 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Changes
to accounting principles are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ASU s to the FASB s Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASU s on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations, stockholders deficit, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Management has evaluated all recent accounting
pronouncements as issued by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ASU through the date these financial
statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements,
when adopted, will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are
not required to provide information requested by this item. 

34 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Based
on an evaluation performed by the principal executive officer and the principal finance officer, the disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the issuer; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with
 authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In
September 2024, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management s assessment included an evaluation
of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and controls of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal controls over financial
reporting were ineffective. 

Also,
based on the evaluation described in the prior paragraph, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our Disclosure Controls
and Procedures were ineffective. 

We
have identified at least the following deficiencies, which together constitute a material weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024: 

1. 
 We
 have inadequate segregation of duties within our cash disbursement control design. 

2. 
 During
 the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we internally performed all aspects of our financial reporting process including, but not limited
 to, the underlying accounting records and record journal entries and internally maintained responsibility for the preparation of
 the financial statements. Due to the fact these duties were often performed by the same person, a lack of independent review process
 was created over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or
 assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could
 result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

3. 
 We
 do not have a sufficient number of independent or qualified directors for our Board of Directors and a qualified Audit Committee.
 We currently have only two (2) independent directors on our board, which is fully comprised of five directors, and accordingly we
 do not yet have a functioning audit committee, as the only otherwise qualified director is not independent. Further, as a publicly
 traded company, we should strive to have a majority of our board of directors be independent. 

35 

For
the period ending September 30, 2024, Greenway internally performed all aspects of its financial reporting process, including, but not
limited to the underlying accounting records and record journal entries and responsibility for the preparation of the financial statement
due to the fact these duties were performed often times by the same people, a lack of review was created over the financial reporting
process that might result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements
and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

We
are continuing the process of remediating our control deficiencies. However, the material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting that have been identified will not be remediated until numerous new internal controls are implemented and operate for a period
of time, are tested, and we are able to conclude that such internal controls are operating effectively. We cannot provide assurance that
these procedures will be successful in identifying material errors that may exist in our Financial Statements. We cannot make assurances
that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Our management
plans, as capital becomes available to us, to increase the accounting and financial reporting staff and provide future investments in
the continuing education and public company accounting training of our accounting and financial professionals. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control system, there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this quarterly report. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have a material effect on our financial results. However, the lack of a
functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of independent directors on our board of directors resulting in potentially ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, can impact our financial statements. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
