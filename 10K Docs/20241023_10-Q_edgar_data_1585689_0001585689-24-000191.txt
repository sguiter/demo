 million, million of which we paid in cash upon closing. The remaining million was not reflected in the amount of cash consideration paid in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The remaining amount will be paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions by the seller which are expected to occur within the next 12 months. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. On the date of the acquisition, we added existing properties located in the U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") to our franchise portfolio. 
 
 We allocated the cost of the acquisition, including transaction costs, to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis. As a result, we recorded an indefinite-lived brand intangible asset of approximately million and franchise contract intangible assets of approximately million. The franchise contract intangible assets will be amortized over an estimated useful life of years to depreciation and amortization expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations over their respective terms. 
 
 The results of operations related to the Graduate brand, which did not have a material impact on our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were included in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from the date of acquisition to September 30, 2024. 
 
 NoMad 
 
 In April 2024, we acquired a controlling financial interest in Sydell Hotels Resorts, LLC and Sydell Holding Company UK Ltd (collectively, the "Sydell Group"), which owns the NoMad brand. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination and recognized the fair value of an indefinite-lived brand intangible asset of approximately million and management contract intangible assets, with an aggregate fair value of approximately million. The management contract intangible assets will be amortized over a weighted average estimated useful life of approximately years to depreciation and amortization expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations over their respective terms. 
 
 We measured the net assets acquired at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The fair values of the respective net assets acquired were determined by management with assistance from external valuation specialists. We developed our estimate of the fair value of the brand intangible asset and contract intangible assets by applying the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method uses unobservable inputs for projected cash flows, including projected financial results and a discount rate, which are considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value measurement valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Our redeemable noncontrolling interests relate to our interest in the Sydell Group. The Sydell Group's governing documents contain put options that give the noncontrolling interest holders the right to sell their equity interests to us beginning in the second quarter of 2030, as well as call options that give us the right to purchase the remaining equity interests beginning in the second quarter of 2032. The exercise price of the put and call options is based on a multiple of the Sydell Group's earnings as of the date that such option would be exercised. The redeemable noncontrolling interests were recorded at a fair value of million as of the acquisition date.

 Performance Obligations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, deferred revenues for unsatisfied performance obligations consisted of: (i) million related to Hilton Honors that will be recognized as revenue over approximately the next ; (ii) million related to advance consideration received from hotel owners for application, initiation and other fees and system implementation fees; and (iii) million related to other obligations.

Additionally, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could be significant to each of the VIEs individually.

 Our senior secured credit facilities consist of a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a senior secured term loan facility (the "Term Loans"). The obligations under our senior secured credit facilities are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Parent and substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, other than HOC, the named borrower under the senior secured credit facilities. 
 
 In June 2024, we amended the credit agreement governing our Term Loans pursuant to which billion of outstanding Term Loans due June 2028 were replaced with billion of incremental Term Loans due November 2030, aligning their maturity with the outstanding billion tranche of Term Loans due November 2030. Additionally, the entire balance of the Term Loans was repriced with an interest rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus (collectively, the

million of debt issuance costs, which were recognized in other non-operating income (loss), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 In March 2024, we borrowed and subsequently repaid million under the Revolving Credit Facility. No borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, which had an available borrowing capacity of million after considering million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 
 In September 2024, we issued billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2033 (the "2033 Senior Notes" or "September Senior Notes issuance") and incurred an aggregate million of debt issuance costs which were recognized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balance in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of the 2033 Senior Notes. Interest on the 2033 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2025. 
 
 In March 2024, we issued million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (the " 2029 Senior Notes") and million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2032 (the " 2032 Senior Notes") (collectively, the "March Senior Notes issuance") and incurred an aggregate million of debt issuance costs which were recognized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balance in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized to interest expense through the respective maturity dates of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2032 Senior Notes. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2032 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2024. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the March Senior Notes issuance to repay million borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility earlier in March 2024.

 As of September 30, 2024, we determined that all of the performance measures for all outstanding performance shares granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024 were probable of achievement, with the average of the applicable achievement factors estimated to be between the target and maximum achievement percentages for the performance shares granted in 2022 and 2023 and at the target achievement percentage for the performance shares granted in 2024.

 distinct operating segments: (i) management and franchise and (ii) ownership, each of which is reported as a segment based on (a) delivering a similar set of products and services and 
 (b) being managed separately given its distinct economic characteristics. 
 
 The management and franchise segment includes all of the hotels we manage for third-party owners, as well as all franchised hotels that license our IP and where we provide other contracted services, but the day-to-day services of the hotels are operated or managed by someone other than us. Revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers and third-party hotels that are not managed or franchised that use our booking channels and related programs ("strategic partner hotels"), and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. ("HGV"); and (iii) fees for managing the hotels in our ownership segment. The ownership segment primarily derives revenues from nightly hotel room sales, food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. 
 
 The performance of our operating segments is evaluated primarily on operating income (loss), without allocating amortization of contract acquisition costs, other revenues and other expenses, other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties, depreciation and amortization expenses, general and administrative expenses, other operating income (loss) items, which may include impairment losses and gains (losses) on sales of assets, or equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates. Our chief operating decision maker does not use assets by operating segment when assessing performance or making operating segment resource allocations.

 We also have extended debt guarantees and provided letters of credit to owners of certain hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized losses of million in other non-operating loss, net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for debt guarantees extended to certain hotels that we manage that have failed to comply with the requirements of their respective debt agreements. We paid million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to debt guarantees. Our debt guarantees and letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 had expirations ranging from 2025 to 2033 and remaining possible cash outlays totaling million. 
 
 The performance and debt guarantees create variable interests in the ownership entities of the related hotels, of which we are not the primary beneficiary. 
 
 We receive Hilton Honors and program fees from managed and franchised properties that we are contractually required to use to operate our Hilton Honors program, marketing, sales and brands programs and other shared services on behalf of hotel owners. If we collect amounts in excess of amounts expended, we have a commitment to spend these amounts on the related programs. 
 
 We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we expect that the ultimate resolution of all pending or threatened claims and litigation as of September 30, 2024 will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements

 Overview 
 
 Our Business 
 
 Hilton is one of the largest global hospitality companies, with 8,301 properties comprising 1,250,506 rooms in 138 countries and territories as of September 30, 2024. Our premier brand portfolio includes luxury, lifestyle, full service, focused service and all-suites hotel brands, as well as timeshare brands. As of September 30, 2024, we had 203 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, Hilton Honors, an increase of 17 percent from September 30, 2023. 
 
 Segments and Regions 
 
 We analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions. Our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products and services: (i) management and franchise and (ii) ownership. The management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our IP. Revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers and strategic partner hotels, and HGV; and (iii) fees for managing the hotels in our ownership segment. As a manager of hotels, we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for management fees. As a franchisor of hotels, we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and/or related commercial services, such as our reservations system, marketing and information technology services, while a third party manages or operates such franchised hotels. The ownership segment primarily derives revenues from nightly hotel room sales, food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. 
 
 We conduct business in three distinct geographic regions: (i) the Americas; (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and (iii) Asia Pacific. The Americas region includes North America, South America and Central America, including all Caribbean nations. Although the U.S., which represented 66 percent of our system-wide hotel rooms as of September 30, 2024, is included in the Americas region, it is often analyzed separately and apart from the Americas region and, as such, it is presented separately within our hotel operating statistics in " Results of Operations." The EMEA region includes Europe, which represents the western-most peninsula of Eurasia stretching from Iceland in the west to Russia in the east, and the Middle East and Africa ("MEA"), which represents the Middle East region and all African nations, including the Indian Ocean island nations. Europe and MEA are often analyzed separately and, as such, are presented separately within our hotel operating 
 17 

statistics in " Results of Operations." The Asia Pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of Asia, as well as India, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Island nations. 
 
 System Growth and Development Pipeline 
 
 Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network, in particular our fee-based business. As we enter into new management and franchise contracts and enter into strategic agreements to complement our hotel portfolio, we expand our business with limited or no capital investment by us as the manager, franchisor or licensor, since the capital required to build, renovate and maintain hotels is typically provided by the third-party owners with whom we contract to provide management services, license our IP or provide access to our booking channels. Prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline, we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on its geographic location, the credit quality of the third-party owner and other factors. By increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with third-party owners, over time we expect to increase revenues, overall return on invested capital and free cash flow. See further discussion on our cash management policy in " Liquidity and Capital Resources." The current economic environment, including elevated levels of inflation and interest rates, has posed certain challenges to the execution of our growth strategy, which in some cases have included and may continue to include delays in openings and new development. 
 
 In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our global hotel network through our development pipeline, which represents hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future. The following table summarizes our development activity:

 (4) Additions include 411 hotels and over 19,300 rooms related to strategic partner hotels. 
 (5) The hotels in our development pipeline were under development throughout 120 countries and territories, including 28 countries and territories where we had no existing hotels, with 235,400 rooms under construction and 280,700 rooms located outside of the U.S. Rooms under construction include rooms for hotels under construction or in the process of conversion to our system. Nearly all of the rooms in our development pipeline will be in our management and franchise segment upon opening. We do not consider any individual development project to be material to us. 

Key Business and Financial Metrics Used by Management 
 
 Comparable Hotels 
 
 We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year, have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods and were open January 1st of the previous year; and (ii) have not undergone large-scale capital projects, sustained substantial property damage, encountered business interruption or for which comparable results were not available. We exclude strategic partner hotels from our comparable hotels. Of the 8,200 hotels in our system as of September 30, 2024, 400 hotels were strategic partner hotels and 6,150 hotels were classified as comparable hotels. Our 1,650 non-comparable hotels as of September 30, 2024 included (i) 844 hotels that were added to our system after January 1, 2023 or that have undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported and (ii) 806 hotels that were removed from the comparable group for the current or comparable periods reported because they underwent or are undergoing large-scale capital projects, sustained substantial property damage, encountered business interruption or comparable results were otherwise not available. 
 
 18 

Occupancy 
 
 Occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period. Occupancy measures the utilization of available capacity at a hotel or group of hotels. Management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help management determine achievable Average Daily Rate ("ADR") pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases. 
 
 ADR 
 
 ADR represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period. ADR measures the average room price attained by a hotel, and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use ADR to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above. 
 Revenue per Available Room ("RevPAR") 
 
 RevPAR is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels, as previously described: occupancy and ADR. RevPAR is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels. 
 
 References to occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are presented on a comparable basis, based on the comparable hotels as of September 30, 2024, and references to ADR and RevPAR are presented on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. As such, comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 use the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of the Company's foreign operations within its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 EBITDA reflects net income (loss), excluding interest expense, a provision for income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("FF E") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) share-based compensation; (vi) reorganization, severance, relocation and other expenses; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and expenses included in other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items. 
 
 We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. Additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. For instance, interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore, could vary significantly across companies. Depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are assigned to those depreciating or amortizing assets for accounting purposes. For Adjusted EBITDA, we also exclude items such as: (i) FF E replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of capital expenditures for property and equipment, where depreciation of such capitalized assets is reported within depreciation and amortization expenses; (ii) share-based compensation, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; and (iii) other items that are not reflective of our operating performance, such as amounts related to debt restructurings and debt retirements and reorganization and related severance costs, to enhance period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations. Further, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and expenses, classified in other revenues from managed and franchised properties and other expenses from managed and franchised properties, respectively, as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit or loss over the 
 19 

life of these programs. The direct reimbursements from hotel owners are billable and reimbursable as the costs are incurred and have no net effect on net income (loss). The fees we recognize related to the indirect reimbursements may be recognized before or after the related expenses are incurred, causing timing differences between the recognition of the costs incurred and the related reimbursement from hotel owners, with the net effect impacting net income (loss) in the reporting period. However, the expenses incurred related to the indirect reimbursements are expected to equal the revenues earned from the indirect reimbursements over time, and, therefore, the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and expenses is not used by management to evaluate our operating performance or make operating decisions. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flows, derived in accordance with GAAP. Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, including: 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; 
 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 
 other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 
 Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business, return to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

Results of Operations 
 
 The hotel operating statistics by region for our system-wide comparable hotels were as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 30, 2024 2024 vs. 2023 September 30, 2024 2024 vs. 2023 System-wide Occupancy 75.3 0.3 pts. 72.8 0.7 pts.

ADR 169.59 0.8 167.83 0.9 RevPAR 127.83 1.0 123.27 1.4 Americas (excluding U.S.) Occupancy 72.7 0.4 pts. 69.9 1.1 pts. ADR 155.80 3.9 156.53 4.2 RevPAR 113.22 4.4 109.46 5.9 Europe Occupancy 81.3 2.3 pts. 74.7 2.6 pts. ADR 179.46 4.3 166.42 3.9 RevPAR 145.89 7.3 124.34 7.7 MEA Occupancy 70.5 2.3 pts. 70.9 2.5 pts.

 System-wide RevPAR increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, supported by improvements in system-wide ADR, which included the impact of inflation, and increases in occupancy in most regions, which were driven by increases in group demand. The increases in RevPAR in the U.S. were driven by increases in weekday travel, primarily for groups, with consistent growth in business. The Americas region, excluding the U.S., continued to see improvement resulting from increases in inbound leisure travel in Mexico and the Caribbean and Latin America. The RevPAR increases in Europe were driven by continued growth in inbound international travel, which, during the periods, increased in several major cities that held large popular sporting events. MEA continued to benefit from increased demand driven by special regional events as well as more relaxed travel policies. The decrease in Asia Pacific during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by tougher year-over-year comparisons in China, after the reacceleration in the prior year as a result of the removal of cross-border travel restrictions. The increase in Asia Pacific for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to growth in countries outside of China across the region, as the result of less restrictive tourism policies and special events in the region, particularly in leisure travel.

 (1) Amount includes losses recognized related to equity and debt financing that we had previously provided to an unconsolidated affiliate with underlying investments in certain hotels that we manage or franchise; refer to Note 5: "Loss on Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliate" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 (2) Amount includes losses on debt guarantees for certain hotels that we manage; refer to Note 13: "Commitments and Contingencies" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 (3) Amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relates to restructuring costs related to one of our leased properties as well as transaction costs resulting from the amendment of our Term Loans and transaction costs incurred for acquisitions. Amounts for all periods include net losses (gains) related to certain of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, other than the loss included separately in "loss on investments in unconsolidated affiliate," severance and other items. 

Revenues 
 
 Three Months Ended Percent Nine Months Ended Percent September 30, Change September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 (in millions) (in millions) Franchise and licensing fees 698 643 8.6 1,958 1,769 10.7 Base and other management fees 88 81 8.6 287 247 16.2 Incentive management fees 66 63 4.8 204 197 3.6 Total management fees 154 144 6.9 491 444 10.6 
 
 The increases in franchise and management fees were largely attributable to increases in RevPAR at our comparable franchised and managed hotels. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, RevPAR at our comparable franchised and managed hotels increased 1.0 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, contributing to currency neutral increases in franchise and management fees of 14 million and 7 million, respectively. The increases in RevPAR at our comparable franchised and managed hotels for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were due to increased occupancy of 1.3 percentage points at our managed hotels, and increased ADR of 0.9 percent at both our franchised and managed hotels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, RevPAR at our comparable franchised and managed hotels increased 1.4 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, contributing to currency neutral increases in franchise and management fees of 43 million and 28 million, respectively. The increases in RevPAR at our comparable franchised and managed hotels for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due to increased occupancy of 0.2 percentage points and 2.4 percentage points, respectively, and increased ADR of 1.2 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. 
 
 22 

Further, franchise and management fees included net increases of 15 million and 4 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 40 million and 10 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of net hotel additions between the periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, franchise and management fees also increased as a result of increases of 8 million and 21 million, respectively, in termination fees received from hotels that exited our system. 
 
 Licensing fees increased 23 million and 95 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of increases in fees from our strategic partnerships, primarily resulting from activity under our co-branded credit card arrangements, and branded residential fees. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included increased license fees from HGV timeshare revenues, inclusive of the impact of adding new timeshare properties to our system between the periods, including those acquired by HGV from third parties.

 330 335 (1.5) 922 924 (0.2) 
 
 Owned and leased hotels revenues decreased 5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on a currency neutral basis. The 2 million decrease in owned and leased hotels revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 13 million decrease resulting from unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a currency neutral increase of 11 million. 
 
 Revenues from our comparable owned and leased hotels increased 8 million and 48 million, on a currency neutral basis, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to increases in RevPAR at our comparable owned and leased hotels of 6.7 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively. The increases in RevPAR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due to increases in occupancy of 2.5 percentage points and 3.1 percentage points, respectively, and ADR of 3.4 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. The currency neutral decreases in revenues from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels of 13 million and 37 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, included decreases related to hotels undergoing renovations during the periods, a hotel that exited our system and the business disruption that occurred at our leased hotel in Israel due to the ongoing military conflict.

 Owned and leased hotels expenses decreased 13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on a currency neutral basis. The 16 million decrease in owned and leased hotels expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 10 million decrease on a currency neutral basis and a decrease of 6 million from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Expenses from our comparable owned and leased hotels increased 6 million and 23 million, on a currency neutral basis, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of increased occupancy and cost inflation, primarily due to increases in payroll and other compensation costs. The 19 million and 33 million net decreases in owned and 
 23 

leased hotels expenses, on a currency neutral basis, from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, include decreases related to hotels undergoing renovations, a hotel that exited our system and the business disruption that occurred at our leased hotel in Israel due to the ongoing military conflict.

 The decreases in depreciation and amortization expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to decreases in amortization expense, driven by decreases of 10 million and 29 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, for certain intangible assets that became fully amortized during the three months ended December 31, 2023. These decreases were mostly offset by increases related to software and corporate and hotel assets placed in service between the periods. 
 
 The increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to increases in costs related to payroll and other compensation costs. 
 
 The increase in other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to costs associated with higher procurement volume from our purchasing operations.

 In November 2023, we amended the credit agreement governing the Term Loans to convert 1.0 billion of the outstanding Term Loans to a new tranche with an interest rate of SOFR plus 1.85 and 1.6 billion of the outstanding Term Loans, along with 500 million of new aggregate principal amount, into a new tranche with an interest rate of SOFR plus 2.10 (the "November 2023 Amendment"). 
 
 The increases in interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to (i) increases related to the Term Loans of 8 million and 37 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of the modifications from the November 2023 Amendment, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also as a result of increases in one-month SOFR for the comparable periods, and (ii) increases of 19 million and 36 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to the March Senior Notes issuance and the September Senior Notes issuance. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included an increase of 11 million in variable rent for our hotels subject to finance leases, which is generally based on a percentage of hotel revenues or profits, which increased for our comparable hotels as discussed in " Revenues." The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 16 million due to interest rate swaps used to mitigate floating interest rate risk, including an increase in the amortization of net swap gains released from accumulated other comprehensive loss from a designated interest rate swap to offset interest expense and a decrease in the amount of the net swap losses released from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense related to a previous interest rate swap that was dedesignated in a prior period. 
 24 

The net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are the result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including on certain intercompany financing arrangements, such as short-term cross-currency intercompany loans, as well as transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
 
 The loss on investments in unconsolidated affiliate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included: (i) a 44 million other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investment in the Fund and (ii) 48 million of credit losses on financing receivables provided to the Fund. See Note 5: "Loss on Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliate" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 The net change in other non-operating income (loss), net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in losses on debt guarantees for certain hotels that Hilton manages. See Note 13: "Commitments and Contingencies" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the decrease in income before income taxes. The decrease in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to increased excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in income before income taxes.

 As of September 30, 2024, our management and franchise segment included 820 managed and 7,431 franchised and licensed properties, which included 101 timeshare and 400 strategic partner hotels, consisting of 1,233,343 total rooms, and our ownership segment included 50 hotels consisting of 17,163 total rooms. Refer to Note 12: "Business Segments" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for reconciliations of revenues for our reportable segments to consolidated total revenues and of segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, refer to " Revenues" for further discussion of the increases in our franchise and licensing fees and total management fees, which reflect our management and franchise segment revenues and segment operating income, as well as for further discussion of the decreases in revenues from our owned and leased hotels, which reflect our ownership segment revenues. In addition, refer to " Operating Expenses" for further discussion of the decreases in operating expenses at our owned and leased hotels, which, when netted with ownership segment revenues and management fees charged by our management and franchise segment, results in our ownership segment operating income (loss). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 1,655 million, including 75 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. The majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents is related to cash collateral and cash held for FF E reserves. 
 
 Our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including: (i) costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels; (ii) corporate expenses; (iii) payroll and compensation costs; (iv) taxes and compliance costs; (v) scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness; (vi) lease payments under our finance and operating leases; (vii) costs, other than compensation and lease payments that are noted separately, associated with the operations of owned and leased hotels, including, but not limited to, utilities and operating supplies; (viii) committed contract acquisition costs; (ix) capital and maintenance expenditures for required renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment; (x) dividends as declared; and (xi) share repurchases. 
 
 Our known long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for: (i) scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness; (ii) lease payments under our finance and operating leases; (iii) committed contract acquisition costs; (iv) capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment; (v) corporate capital and information technology expenditures; (vi) dividends as declared; (vii) share repurchases; and (viii) commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment made in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by these 
 25 

owners through Hilton Honors and program fees to operate our Hilton Honors program, marketing, sales and brands programs and shared services. 
 
 In March 2024, we issued a total of 1.0 billion of 5.875 2029 Senior Notes and 6.125 2032 Senior Notes and used 200 million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. In June 2024, we amended the credit agreement governing our Term Loans pursuant to which (i) 1.0 billion of outstanding Term Loans due June 2028 were replaced with 1.0 billion of incremental Term Loans due November 2030, aligning their maturity with the outstanding 2.1 billion tranche of Term Loans due November 2030 and (ii) the entire balance of the Term Loans was repriced with an interest rate of SOFR plus 1.75 . In September 2024, we issued 1.0 billion of 2033 Senior Notes and intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 6: "Debt" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Except for the March and September Senior Notes issuances and the amendment to the credit agreement governing our Term Loans in June 2024, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations from what we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 10.2 million shares of our common stock for 2,113 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.7 billion remained available for share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. 
 
 In circumstances where we have the opportunity to support our strategic objectives, we may provide guarantees or other commitments, as necessary, to owners of hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise or other third parties. See Note 13: "Commitments and Contingencies" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our commitments that were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We have a long-term investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. Within the framework of our investment policy, we intend to finance our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, cash generated from our operations and, as needed, the use of the available capacity of our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we have continued access to debt markets and expect to be able to obtain financing as a source of liquidity as required and to extend maturities of existing borrowings, if necessary. 
 
 After considering our approach to liquidity and our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and other compensation costs, taxes and compliance costs, current maturities of long-term debt and other commitments for the foreseeable future based on current conditions. The objectives of our cash management policy are maintaining the availability of liquidity and minimizing operational costs. 
 
 We may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt and/or purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Issuances or incurrence of new debt (or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt) and/or purchases or retirements of outstanding debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Our Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 The following table summarizes our net cash flows: 
 
 Nine Months Ended Percent September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 1,431 1,481 (3.4) Net cash used in investing activities (367) (228) 61.0 Net cash used in financing activities (274) (1,744) (84.3) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated from management, franchise and licensing fee revenue and operating income from our owned and leased hotels. The decrease in net cash inflows during the period was primarily due to a 
 26 

50 million increase in the net cash outflows related to income tax payments, primarily due to income tax refunds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an outflow of 77 million for debt guarantee payments. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the increase in cash inflows generated from our management and franchise segment, discussed in " Revenues," largely as a result of an increase in RevPAR at our comparable managed and franchised hotels as well as revenues from new hotels added, net of hotels removed, and a 77 million decrease in payments of contract acquisition costs due to the timing of certain strategic hotel developments supporting our growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities primarily included cash flows related to: (i) the acquisitions of (a) the Graduate brand and the associated franchise contracts and (b) a controlling financial interest in the Sydell Group, both completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) capitalized software costs that were related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations, and (iii) capital expenditures for property and equipment related to corporate property and the renovation of certain hotels in our ownership segment, which decreased between the periods due to the timing of certain corporate and hotel capital expenditure projects. Additionally, our investing activities include the net cash inflows and outflows related to our undesignated derivative financial instruments that we have in place to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on certain of our intercompany loan and cash balances, which were primarily the result of changes in the exchange rates for the Pound Sterling to the U.S. dollar for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a 2.0 billion increase in cash inflows from the March and September Senior Notes issuances. This increase in cash inflows was partially offset by a 532 million increase in cash outflows for share repurchases. 
 
 Debt and Borrowing Capacity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness, excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts, was approximately 11.3 billion. No debt amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, which had an available borrowing capacity of 1,913 million after considering 87 million of outstanding letters of credit. For additional information on our total indebtedness and guarantees on our debt, refer to Note 6: "Debt" in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities. We do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to 2027 other than the May 2025 Senior Notes due in May 2025, and we believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity and access to debt financing to address the repayment of the May 2025 Senior Notes at or prior to their maturity date. Our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We have discussed the estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment in their application and are based on information that is inherently uncertain in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to those critical accounting estimates that were previously disclosed. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in one-month SOFR, the benchmark rate for which the interest rate of the majority of our variable-rate indebtedness is based on, and foreign currency exchange rates. These rate changes may affect future income, cash flows and the fair value of the Company, its assets and its liabilities. In certain situations, we may seek to reduce volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into derivative financial instruments intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. We 
 27 

continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into derivative financial instruments to the extent they meet our objectives to reduce volatility in our results of operations and cash flows, and we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Our exposure to market risk has not materially changed from what was previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 28 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums, including proceedings involving tort and other general liability claims, employee claims, consumer protection claims and claims related to our management of certain hotels. We recognize a liability when we believe the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Most occurrences involving liability, claims of negligence and employees are covered by indemnification from third-party hotel owners and/or policies that we hold with solvent insurance carriers. The ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. We believe we have adequate reserves against such matters. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed under "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
