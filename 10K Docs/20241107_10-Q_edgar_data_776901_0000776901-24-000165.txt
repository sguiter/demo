 Equity Securities 
 The Company had equity securities of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These securities consist primarily of mutual funds held in a rabbi trust and will be used for future payments associated with the Company s supplemental executive retirement plans.

Additionally, the Company did record any write-offs of accrued interest income on available for sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 When securities are sold, the adjusted cost of the specific security sold is used to compute the gain or loss on the sale. The Company had no sales of securities available for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and therefore gains or losses were realized during the periods presented.

 The Company does not intend to sell these investments and has determined, based upon available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell each security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. In addition, management does not believe that any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. As a result, the Company did recognize a provision for credit losses on these investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company made this determination by reviewing various qualitative and quantitative factors regarding each investment category, such as current market conditions, extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, and current analysts evaluations. 
 As a result of the Company s review of these qualitative and quantitative factors, the causes of the impairments listed in the table above by category were as follows at September 30, 2024: 
 U.S. Government Agency Securities, U.S. Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Small Business Administration Pooled Securities: These portfolios have contractual terms that generally do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the current par value of the investment. The decline in market value of these securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. Additionally, these securities are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government or one of its agencies. 
 Pooled Trust Preferred Securities: This portfolio consists of one security which is performing. The unrealized loss on this security is attributable to the illiquid nature of the trust preferred market in the current economic and regulatory environment. Management evaluates collateral credit and instrument structure, including current and

 ) ) U.S. treasury securities ) ) Agency mortgage-backed securities ) ) Agency collateralized mortgage obligations ) ) Single issuer trust preferred securities issued by banks ) ) Small business administration pooled securities ) ) Total held to maturity securities ) ) 
 Substantially all held to maturity securities held by the Company are guaranteed by the U.S. federal government or other government sponsored agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. As a result, management has determined these securities to have a zero loss expectation and therefore the Company did record a provision for estimated credit losses on any held to maturity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Excluded from the table above is accrued interest on held to maturity securities of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company did record any write-offs of accrued interest income on held to maturity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Furthermore, securities held by the Company were delinquent on contractual payments nor were any securities placed on non-accrual status at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 When securities are sold, the adjusted cost of the specific security sold is used to compute the gain or loss on the sale. The Company had no sales of held to maturity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and therefore gains or losses were realized for such periods. 
 
 The Company monitors the credit quality of held to maturity securities through the use of credit ratings. Credit ratings are monitored by the Company on at least a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2024, all held to maturity securities held by the Company were rated investment grade or higher.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The balance of allowance for credit losses increased to million as of September 30, 2024 compared to million at December 31, 2023, driven primarily by specific reserve allocations on certain commercial loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the purpose of estimating the allowance for credit losses, management segregated the loan portfolio into the portfolio segments detailed in the above tables. Each of these loan categories possesses unique risk characteristics that are considered when determining the appropriate level of allowance for each segment. Some of the characteristics unique to each loan category include: 
 Commercial Portfolio 
 Commercial and Industrial : Consists of revolving, nonrevolving, and term loan obligations extended to business and corporate enterprises for the purpose of financing working capital and/or capital investment. Collateral generally consists of accounts receivable, inventory, plant and equipment, real estate, or other business assets. The primary source of repayment is operating cash flow and, secondarily, liquidation of assets. 
 Commercial Real Estate : Consists of mortgage loans to finance investment in real property such as multi-family residential, commercial/retail, office, industrial, hotels, educational and healthcare facilities, as well as other specific use properties and is inclusive of owner-occupied commercial properties. Loans are typically written with amortizing payment structures. Collateral values are determined based upon third party appraisals and evaluations. Permissible loan to value ratios at origination are governed by Company policy and regulatory guidelines. The primary source of repayment is cash flow from operating leases and rents and, secondarily, liquidation of assets. 
 Commercial Construction : Consists of short-term construction loans, revolving and nonrevolving credit lines and construction/permanent loans to finance the acquisition, development and construction or rehabilitation of real property. Project types include residential land development, one-to-four family, condominium, and multi-family home construction, commercial/retail, office, industrial, hotels, educational and healthcare facilities as well as other specific use properties. Loans may be written with non-amortizing or hybrid payment structures depending upon the type of project. Collateral values are determined based upon third party appraisals and evaluations. Permissible loan to value ratios at origination are governed by Company policy and regulatory guidelines. Repayment sources vary depending upon the type of project and may consist of proceeds from the sale or lease of units, operating cash flows or liquidation of other assets. 
 Small Business: Consists of revolving, term loan and mortgage obligations extended to sole proprietors and small businesses for purposes of financing working capital and/or capital investment. Collateral generally consists of pledges of business assets including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, plant and equipment, or real estate if applicable. The primary source of repayment is operating cash flows and, secondarily, liquidation of assets. 
 For the commercial portfolio the Company typically obtains personal guarantees for payment from individuals holding material ownership interests in the borrowing entities. 
 Consumer Portfolio 
 Residential Real Estate : Residential mortgage loans held in the Company s portfolio are made to borrowers who demonstrate the ability to make scheduled payments with full consideration to underwriting factors such as current and expected income, employment status, current assets, other financial resources, credit history and the value of the collateral. Collateral consists of mortgage liens on one-to-four family residential properties. Residential mortgage loans also include loans to construct owner-occupied one-to-four family residential properties. 
 Home Equity : Home equity loans and credit lines are made to qualified individuals and are primarily secured by senior or junior mortgage liens on one-to-four family homes, condominiums or vacation homes. Each home equity loan has a fixed rate and is billed in equal payments comprised of principal and interest. The majority of home equity lines of credit have a variable rate and are billed in interest-only payments during the draw period. At the end of the draw period, the home equity line of credit is billed as a percentage of the then outstanding principal balance plus all accrued interest over a predetermined repayment period, as set forth in the note. Additionally, the Company has the option of renewing each line of credit for additional draw periods. Borrower qualifications include favorable credit history combined with supportive income requirements and combined loan to value ratios within established policy guidelines. 
 Other Consumer: Other consumer loan products include personal lines of credit and amortizing loans made to qualified individuals for various purposes such as debt consolidation, personal expenses or overdraft protection. Borrower qualifications include favorable credit history combined with supportive income and collateral requirements within established policy guidelines. These loans may be secured or unsecured.

 For the Company s consumer portfolio, the quality of the loan is best indicated by the repayment performance of an individual borrower. However, the Company does supplement performance data with current Fair Isaac Corporation FICO scores and Loan to Value LTV estimates. Current FICO data is purchased and appended to all consumer loans on a regular basis. In addition, automated valuation services and broker opinions of value are used to supplement original value data for the residential real estate and home equity portfolios, periodically.

 The maximum length of time over which the Company is currently hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments is years. 
 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments, the effective portion of the gains or losses is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The Company expects approximately (pre-tax) to be reclassified as an increase to net interest income and million (pre-tax) to be reclassified as a decrease to net interest income, from other comprehensive income related to the Company s cash flow hedges in the twelve months following September 30, 2024. This reclassification is due to anticipated payments that will be made and/or received on the swaps based upon the forward curve at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company had fair value hedges as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the respective nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of loans held for sale increased by and decreased by . These amounts were offset in earnings by the change in the fair value of mortgage derivatives. 
 Outstanding loan commitments expose the Company to the risk that the price of the loans arising from exercise of the loan commitment might change from inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan due to changes in mortgage interest rates. If interest rates increase, the value of these loan commitments decreases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, the value of these loan commitments increases. To protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments, the Company utilizes both mandatory delivery and best efforts forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loans that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments. Mandatory delivery contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments. Included in the mandatory delivery forward commitments are To Be Announced securities TBAs ). Certain assumptions, including pull through rates and rate lock periods, are used in managing the existing and future hedges. The accuracy of underlying assumptions will impact the ultimate effectiveness of any hedging strategies. 
 With mandatory delivery contracts, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date. If the Company fails to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, it is obligated to pay a pair-off fee, based on then-current market prices, to the investor/counterparty to compensate the investor for the shortfall. Generally, the Company makes this type of commitment once mortgage loans have been funded and are held for sale, in order to minimize the risk of failure to deliver the requisite volume of loans to the investor and paying pair-off fees as a result. The Company also sells TBA securities to offset potential changes in the fair value of derivative loan commitments. Generally, the Company sells TBA securities by entering into derivative loan commitments for settlement in 30 to 90 days. The Company expects that mandatory delivery contracts, including TBA securities, will experience changes in fair value opposite to the changes in the fair value of derivative loan commitments. 
 With best effort contracts, the Company commits to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. Generally, best efforts cash contracts have no pair off risk regardless of market movement. The price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded (e.g., on the same day the lender commits to lend funds to a potential borrower). The Company expects that these best efforts forward loan sale commitments will experience a net neutral shift in fair value with related derivative loan commitments. 
 The aggregate amount of net realized gains on sales of mortgage loans included within mortgage banking income was million and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Balance Sheet Offsetting 
 The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments. The Company does net the amount recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral against the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Collateral legally required to be maintained at dealer banks by the Company is monitored and adjusted as necessary. 
 A daily settlement occurs through the CME for changes in the fair value of centrally cleared derivatives. Not all of the derivatives are required to be cleared through the daily clearing agent. As a result, the total fair values of loan level derivative assets and liabilities recognized on the Company s financial statements are not equal and offsetting.

 The Company s derivative agreements with institutional counterparties contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as requiring the Company to maintain a well-capitalized capital position. If the Company fails to meet these conditions, the counterparties could request the Company make immediate payment or demand that the Company provide immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative positions in net liability positions. All derivative instruments with credit-risk contingent features were in a net asset position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 By using derivatives, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Company s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all swaps with each counterparty. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Institutional counterparties must have an investment grade credit rating and be approved by the Company s Board of Directors. In addition, certain derivative contracts executed bilaterally with a dealer counterparty in the over-the-counter market are cleared through a clearinghouse, whereby the clearinghouse becomes the counterparty to the transaction. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with those counterparties is remote. The Company s exposure relating to institutional counterparties was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s exposure relating to customer counterparties was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Credit exposure may be reduced by the value of collateral pledged by the counterparty.

Executive Level Overview 
 Management evaluates the Company's operating results and financial condition using measures that include net income, earnings per share, return on assets and equity, return on tangible common equity, net interest margin, tangible book value per share, asset quality indicators, and many others. These metrics are used by management to make key decisions regarding the Company's balance sheet, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, and capital resources and assist with identifying opportunities for improving the Company's financial position or operating results. The Company focuses on organic growth, but will also consider growth through acquisition. Any potential acquisition opportunities are evaluated for the potential to provide a satisfactory financial return as well as other criteria (ease of integration, synergies, geographical location). 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Results 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 42.9 million, or 1.01 on a diluted earnings per share basis, as compared to 60.8 million, or 1.38 on a diluted earnings per share basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing decreases of 29.4 and 26.8 , respectively, due primarily to lower net interest income and the impact of an elevated provision for credit losses attributable to specific reserve allocations on one large commercial real estate loan. Despite a rise in the provision for credit losses, third quarter 2024 results reflected solid overall business activity amidst a continued challenging environment, including the following key drivers: 
 
 Net interest margin expansion to 3.29 ; 
 Robust core deposit growth, with average deposits up 330.0 million (8.74 annualized) for the quarter; 
 Strong fee income; 
 Focused expense management; and 
 Strong capital levels, with tangible book value per share growth of 1.38 for the quarter.

 Interest-Earning Assets 
 
 The results depicted in the following table reflect the trend of the Company's interest-earning assets over the past five quarters. While the Company employs a longer term strategy that typically emphasizes loan growth commensurate with overall economic growth, changes over the five quarter period reflect relatively consistent balances of total interest-earning assets. The following table summarizes the Company's average interest-earning assets for each period presented: 

Management strives to be disciplined about loan pricing and considers interest rate sensitivity when generating loan assets. In addition, management takes a disciplined approach to credit underwriting, seeking to avoid undue credit risk and credit losses.

 Funding and Net Interest Margin 
 
 The Company's overall sources of funding reflect strong business and retail deposit growth with management's emphasis on core deposit growth to fund loans. In conjunction with deposit growth during the first nine months of 2024, total borrowings decreased by 555.0 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, along with the full redemption of 50.0 million in subordinated debentures during the first quarter of 2024. The following chart shows sources of funding for the trailing five quarters:

 Expense Control 
 
 Management seeks to take a balanced approach to noninterest expense control by monitoring ongoing operating expenses while making needed capital expenditures and prudently investing in growth initiatives. The Company s primary expenses arise from employee salaries and benefits, as well as expenses associated with buildings and equipment. 
 
 The following chart depicts the Company's efficiency ratio (calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of noninterest income and net interest income) over the past five quarters:

 Capital 
 
 The Company's approach with respect to revenue and expense is designed to promote long-term earnings growth, which in turn contributes to capital growth. Capital is primarily impacted by earnings retention, dividends, changes in other comprehensive income, and opportunistic share repurchases. The following chart shows the Company's book value and tangible book value per share over the past five quarters: 

See "Non-GAAP Measures" below for a reconciliation to GAAP financial measures. 
 
 The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.57 per share for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 3.6 from the 2023 third quarter dividend rate of 0.55. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 When management assesses the Company s financial performance for purposes of making day-to-day and strategic decisions, it does so based upon the performance of its core banking business, which is primarily derived from the combination of net interest income and noninterest or fee income, reduced by operating expenses, the provision for credit losses, and the impact of income taxes and other noncore items shown in the table that follows. There are items that impact the Company's results that management believes are unrelated to its core banking business such as gains or losses on the sales of securities, merger and acquisition expenses, provision for credit losses on acquired portfolios, loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment and other items. Management, therefore, excludes items management considers to be noncore when computing the Company s non-GAAP operating earnings and operating EPS, noninterest income on an operating basis and efficiency ratio on an operating basis. Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility into the Company s core banking business and underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items. 
 
 Management also supplements its evaluation of financial performance with an analysis of tangible book value per share (which is computed by dividing stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, or tangible common equity, by common shares outstanding) and with the Company's tangible common equity ratio (which is computed by dividing tangible common equity by tangible assets) which are non-GAAP measures. The Company has included information on these tangible ratios because management believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess performance and identify trends. The Company has recognized goodwill and other intangible assets in conjunction with merger and acquisition activities. Excluding the impact of goodwill and other intangibles in measuring asset and capital values for the ratios provided, along with other bank standard capital ratios, facilitates comparison of the capital adequacy of the Company to other companies in the financial services industry. 
 
 These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP. An item which management deems to be noncore and excludes when computing these non-GAAP measures can be of substantial importance to the Company s results for any particular period. The Company s non-GAAP performance measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly named non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant management judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Certain estimates associated with these policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. These critical accounting estimates are defined as estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on financial condition or results of operations. 
 There have been no material changes in critical accounting estimates during the first nine months of 2024. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K for a complete listing of critical accounting policies. 

FINANCIAL POSITION 
 Securities Portfolio The Company's securities portfolio primarily consists of U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, agency collateralized mortgage obligations, and small business administration pooled securities. Also included in the Company's securities portfolio are trading and equity securities related to certain employee benefit programs. The majority of these securities are investment grade debt obligations with average lives of five years or less. U.S. government agency securities entail a lesser degree of risk than loans made by the Bank by virtue of the guarantees that back them, require less capital under risk-based capital rules than noninsured or nonguaranteed mortgage loans, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans, and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of the Bank. The Bank views its securities portfolio as a source of income and liquidity. Interest and principal payments generated from securities provide a source of liquidity to fund loans and meet short-term cash needs. 
 Total securities decreased by 165.3 million, or 5.6 , at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, driven primarily by paydowns, calls and maturities, offset partially by new purchases of 48.3 million and 38.1 million of unrealized gains in the available for sale portfolio. As a result, the Company's ratio of securities to total assets decreased to 14.2 at September 30, 2024 compared to 15.1 at December 31, 2023. The Company estimates expected credit losses for its available for sale and held to maturity securities in accordance with the current expected credit loss ("CECL") methodology. Further details regarding the Company's measurement of expected credit losses on securities can be found in Note 2 Securities within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this Report.

Residential Mortgage Loan Sales The Bank s residential mortgage loans are generally originated in compliance with terms, conditions and documentation which permit the sale of such loans to investors in the secondary market. Loan sales in the secondary market provide funds for additional lending and other banking activities. Depending on market conditions, the Bank may sell the servicing of the sold loans for a servicing released premium, simultaneous with the sale of the loan. For the remainder of the sold loans for which the Company retains the servicing, a mortgage servicing asset is recognized. Additionally, as part of its asset/liability management strategy, the Bank may opt to retain certain residential real estate loan originations for its portfolio. When a loan is sold, the Company enters into agreements that contain representations and warranties about the characteristics of the loans sold and their origination. The Company may be required to either repurchase mortgage loans or to indemnify the purchaser from losses if representations and warranties are found to be not accurate in all material respects. The Company incurred no material losses related to residential mortgage repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The Company experienced a lower volume of residential real estate loan sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by reduced customer demand in the current interest rate environment. The following table shows the total residential real estate loans closed and the breakdown of amounts held in portfolio or sold (or held for sale) in the secondary market during the periods indicated: 
 Table 1 - Closed Residential Real Estate Loans 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Held in portfolio 49,062 147,079 136,574 395,915 Sold or held for sale in the secondary market 79,960 25,029 190,842 54,520 Total closed loans 129,022 172,108 327,416 450,435 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a larger portion of new originations were sold in the secondary market versus retained in the Company's portfolio as compared to the same prior year periods, reflecting the Company's 2024 strategy to shift its residential production to the saleable market. 

The table below reflects additional information related to the loans sold during the periods indicated and the sale or retention of the related servicing rights:

 (1) All loans sold with servicing rights retained during the above periods were sold without recourse. 
 
 In the event of a sale with servicing rights retained, a mortgage servicing asset is established, which represents the then current estimated fair value based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing rights are recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income, and are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. Impairment is determined by stratifying the rights based on predominant characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance, to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists, a reduction of the allowance

 may be recorded as an increase to income. The principal balance of loans serviced by the Bank on behalf of investors was 286.4 million, 298.8 million and 304.7 million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

The following table shows the adjusted cost of the servicing rights associated with these loans and the changes for the periods indicated:

 Loan Portfolio The Company's total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 increased by 82.7 million, or 0.6 (0.8 on an annualized basis), when compared to December 31, 2023. The 2024 year-to-date growth was driven primarily by the consumer portfolio, which increased by 53.8 million, or 1.5 , during the period. Total commercial loans also increased by 28.9 million, or 0.27 , during the first nine months of 2024, fueled primarily by continued steady growth in the small business portfolio, which rose 18.1 million, or 7.2 , while the combined commercial real state and construction portfolios remained relatively flat, increasing by 13.0 million, or 0.1 .

 The Company's consumer portfolio primarily consists of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans as well as residential construction lending related to single-home residential development within the Company's market area. The Company also provides home equity loans and lines of credit that may be made as a fixed-rate term loan or under a variable rate revolving line of credit secured by a first or junior mortgage on the borrower's residence or second home. Additionally, the Company makes loans for other personal needs. Other consumer loans primarily consist of installment loans and overdraft protections. The residential real estate, home equity and other consumer portfolios totaled 3.6 billion at September 30, 2024, as noted below: 

(Dollars in thousands) Average loan size 115 Largest individual consumer loan outstanding 5,290 Consumer nonperforming loans/consumer loans 0.38 

Asset Quality The Company continually monitors the asset quality of the loan portfolio using all available information. Based on this assessment, loans demonstrating certain payment issues or other weaknesses may be categorized as delinquent, nonperforming and/or put on nonaccrual status. Further details surrounding relevant asset quality categories are summarized below: 
 
 Delinquency The Company s philosophy toward managing its loan portfolios is predicated upon careful monitoring, which stresses early detection and response to delinquent and default situations. The Company seeks to make arrangements to resolve any delinquent or default situation over the shortest possible time frame. Generally, the Company requires that a delinquency notice be mailed to a borrower upon expiration of a grace period (typically no longer than 15 days beyond the due date). Reminder notices may be sent and telephone calls may be made prior to the expiration of the grace period. If the delinquent status is not resolved within a reasonable time frame following the mailing of a delinquency notice, the Bank s personnel charged with managing its loan portfolios contacts the borrower to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for payment. Any subsequent actions taken to resolve the delinquency will depend upon the nature of the loan and the length of time that the loan has been delinquent. The borrower s needs are considered as much as reasonably possible without jeopardizing the Bank s position. A late charge is usually assessed on loans upon expiration of the grace period. 
 
 Nonaccrual Loans As a general rule, loans 90 days or more past due with respect to principal or interest are classified as nonaccrual loans. However, certain loans that are 90 days or more past due may be kept on an accruing status if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection. Income accruals are suspended on all nonaccrual loans and all previously accrued 
 64 

and uncollected interest is reversed against current income. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest and remains current for a minimum period of six months, the loan is liquidated, or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. 

Loan Modifications In the course of resolving problem loans, the Company may choose to modify the contractual terms of certain loans. The Company attempts to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid or cure a default. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status and may include adjustments to term extensions, interest rates, other than insignificant payment delays and/or a combination thereof. These actions are intended to minimize economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. If such efforts by the Bank do not result in satisfactory performance, the loan is referred to legal counsel, at which time foreclosure proceedings are initiated. At any time prior to a sale of the property at foreclosure, the Bank may terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work out a satisfactory payment plan. All loan modifications are reviewed by the Company to identify if a borrower is deemed to be experiencing financial difficulty at time of the modification. 
 
 Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans Purchased Credit Deteriorated ("PCD") loans are acquired loans which have shown a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. PCD loans are recorded at amortized cost with an allowance for credit losses recorded upon purchase. 
 
 Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets are typically comprised of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned ("OREO"). Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans that are 90 days or more past due but still accruing interest. 
 
 OREO consists of real estate properties, which have primarily served as collateral to secure loans, that are controlled or owned by the Bank. These properties are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date control is established, resulting in a new cost basis. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the fair value (net of estimated costs to sell) of the foreclosed asset is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the foreclosed asset below the new cost basis are recorded through the use of a valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in the fair value are recorded as reductions in the valuation allowance, but not below zero. All costs incurred thereafter in maintaining the property are generally charged to noninterest expense. In the event the real estate is utilized as a rental property, net rental income and expenses are recorded as incurred within noninterest expense.

Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level that management considers appropriate to provide for the Company's current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost. The allowance is increased by providing for credit losses through a charge to expense and by credits for recoveries of loans previously charged-off and is reduced by loans being charged-off. 
 In accordance with the CECL methodology, the Company estimates credit losses for financial assets on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. The model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the contractual life of the exposure, considering the effect of prepayments. Economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year, beyond

 which is a reversion to the Company's historical long-run average for a period of six months. The Company's qualitative assessment is structured based upon nine environmental factors impacting the expected risk of loss within the loan portfolio, with an additional factor designed to capture model imprecision. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual assessment and are removed from the collectively assessed pools to avoid double counting. For the loans that will be individually assessed, the Company uses either a discounted cash flow approach or a fair value of collateral approach. The latter approach is used for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure is probable. 
 Management's allowance for credit loss estimate incorporates an economic forecast over a reasonable and supportable period of 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, the forecast selected by management assumes that the Federal Reserve will cut the policy rate by 25 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2024, that inflation will stabilize and return to 2 target by early 2025, that new home sales will remain stable given the current national housing deficit, and that the outlook for office real estate will remain bearish as uncertainty over occupancy and operating cash flows persists. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses is qualitatively adjusted on a quarterly basis in order to ensure coverage for relationships that are deemed to be more at risk within certain industries, specific collateral types, or other specific characteristics that may be highly impacted by the current economic environment.

 For purposes of the allowance for credit losses, management segregates the portfolio based upon loans sharing similar risk characteristics. The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is made to each loan category using the analytical techniques and estimation methods described in this Report. While these amounts represent management s best estimate of credit losses at the evaluation dates, they are not necessarily indicative of either the categories in which actual losses may occur or the extent of such actual losses that may be recognized within each category. Each of these loan categories possess unique risk characteristics that are considered when determining the appropriate level of allowance for each segment. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. 
 
 The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category at the dates indicated:

 To determine if a loan should be charged-off, all possible sources of repayment are analyzed. Possible sources of repayment include the potential for future cash flows, the value of the Bank s collateral, and the strength of co-makers or guarantors. When available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged-off against the allowance for credit losses and any recoveries of such previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance. 
 
 Regardless of whether a loan is unsecured or collateralized, the Company charges off the amount of any confirmed loan loss in the period when the loans, or portions of loans, are deemed uncollectible. For troubled, collateral-dependent loans, loss-confirming events may include an appraisal or other valuation that reflects a shortfall between the value of the collateral and the carrying value of the loan or receivable, or a deficiency balance following the sale of the collateral. 
 For additional information regarding the Company s allowance for credit losses, see Note 3 Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit Quality within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock The Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for the FHLB of Boston membership is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding as a tool to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. The Company either purchases additional FHLB stock or is subject to redemption of FHLB stock proportional to the volume of funding received. The Company views the holdings as a necessary long-term investment for the purpose of balance sheet liquidity and not for investment return. The Company's investments in FHLB of Boston stock decreased to 29.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 43.6 million at December 31, 2023, in conjunction with reduced levels of outstanding FHLB borrowings. 
 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets were 1.0 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 The Company typically performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of the year, unless certain indicators suggest earlier testing to be warranted. Accordingly, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of 2024 and determined that the Company s goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2024. Other intangible assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. There were no other events or changes during the third quarter of 2024 that indicated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 
 Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policies The Bank holds life insurance policies for the purpose of offsetting its future obligations to its employees under its retirement and benefits plans. The cash surrender value of life insurance policies was 302.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 297.4 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company recorded tax exempt income from life insurance policies of 2.0 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 5.9 million and 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Company recorded no gains on life insurance benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to gains of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and recorded gains of 263,000, and 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Deposits As of September 30, 2024, total deposits were 15.4 billion, representing a 575.5 million, or 3.9 , increase from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by continued consumer demand for higher cost time deposits, along with strong business and municipal deposit inflows. Total noninterest bearing demand deposits comprised 29.3 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, as compared to 30.7 at December 31, 2023. The total cost of deposits was 1.74 and 1.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.62 and 0.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Company's deposits are comprised primarily of core deposits (demand, savings and money market), as well as time deposits. The Company's ratio of core deposits to total deposits represented 81.7 and 84.6 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with the decrease driven primarily by core deposit outflows in conjunction with growth in higher yielding time deposits. In addition, the Company may also utilize brokered deposit sources, as needed, with balances of 61.2 million and 100.9 million outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company's deposit accounts are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The FDIC offers insurance coverage on deposits up to the federally insured limit of 250,000. The Company participates in the IntraFi Network, allowing it to provide easy access to multi-million dollar FDIC deposit insurance protection on certificate of deposit and money market investments for consumers, businesses and public entities. This channel allows the Company to access a reciprocal deposit exchange that can be used to benefit customers seeking increased FDIC insurance protection, and amounted to 1.0 billion and 959.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The estimated balances of uninsured deposits at the Bank were 5.1 billion and 4.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Included in these amounts are 836.3 million and 720.5 million of collateralized deposits, which offer additional protection. 
 
 Borrowings The Company's borrowings consist of both short-term and long-term borrowings and provide the Bank with one of its primary sources of funding. Maintaining available borrowing capacity provides the Bank with a contingent source of liquidity. Borrowings were 663.4 million at September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 555.0 million as compared to December 31, 2023. This decrease was experienced primarily within Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, which decreased 505.0 million in conjunction with deposit balance growth over the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, the Company fully redeemed its outstanding subordinated debentures with an aggregate principal amount of 50.0 million during the first quarter of 2024. 
 The Company had 8.8 billion and 8.5 billion of assets pledged as collateral against borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These assets are primarily pledged to the FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

Capital Resources On September 19, 2024 the Company s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.57 per share to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2024. This dividend was paid on October 4, 2024. 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s and the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Total, Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (as defined for regulatory purposes) to risk weighted assets (as defined for regulatory purposes) and Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimum requirements for all applicable ratios that were in effect during the respective periods. The Company s and the Bank s capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table, along with the applicable minimum requirements as of each date indicated:

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements outlined in the table above, the Company is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. The required amount of the capital conservation buffer is 2.5 . At September 30, 2024, the Company's capital levels exceeded the buffer. 
 Dividend Restrictions The Company is subject to capital and dividend requirements administered by federal and state bank regulators, and the Company will not declare a cash dividend that would cause the Company to violate regulatory requirements. The Company is, in the ordinary course of business, dependent upon the receipt of cash dividends from the Bank to pay cash dividends to shareholders and satisfy the Company s other cash needs. Federal and state law impose limits on capital distributions by the Bank. Massachusetts-chartered banks, such as the Bank, may declare from net profits cash dividends not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited, or paid if the Bank s capital stock would be impaired. Massachusetts Bank Commissioner approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. Dividends paid by the Bank to the Company totaled 45.3 million and 56.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and totaled 138.5 million and 178.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Trust Preferred Securities In accordance with the applicable accounting standard related to variable interest entities, the common stock of trusts which have issued trust preferred securities has not been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were 61.0 million in trust preferred securities included in the Tier 2 capital of the Company for regulatory reporting purposes pursuant to the Federal Reserve's capital adequacy guidelines.

Net Interest Income The amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the volume, mix, and interest rate sensitivity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 On a fully tax equivalent basis FTE ), net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 142.9 million, representing a decrease of 8.1 million, or 5.4 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net interest income on a FTE basis was 420.6 million, representing a decrease of 44.2 million, or 9.5 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These 2024 decreases in net interest income were primarily attributable to rising deposit costs, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.29 and 3.26 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing decreases of 18 basis points and 34 basis points, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods.

 Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses represents the charge to expense that is required to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses. The Company recorded a provision for credit loss of 19.5 million and 28.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to a provision for credit loss of 5.5 million and 17.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 increase is primarily attributable to specific reserve allocations on commercial loans and, to a lesser extent, net loan growth over the first nine months of 2024. 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 1.14 at September 30, 2024, 1.00 at December 31, 2023, and 0.99 at September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 3, Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit Quality within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this Report, for further details surrounding the primary drivers of the provision for credit losses for the period. 
 
 Noninterest Income The following table sets forth information regarding noninterest income for the periods shown:

 The primary reasons for the variances in the noninterest income categories shown in the preceding table include: 
 Deposit account fees were higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods primarily to increased overdraft and cash management fees. 
 Interchange and ATM fees were higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods due primarily to higher transaction volumes.

 Investment management and advisory income increased, driven primarily by higher levels of assets under administration, which increased by 1.0 billion, or 17.0 , to 7.2 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.1 billion at September 30, 2023. This increase was partially offset by lower insurance commission income recognized in 2024 as compared to the same 2023 periods. 
 Mortgage banking income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods due primarily to a greater portion of new originations being sold in the secondary market versus being retained in the Company's portfolio during 2024 as compared to the same 2023 periods. 
 The Company received minimal proceeds on life insurance policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loan level derivative income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the same prior year periods, reflecting fluctuations in customer demand fueled by changes in the macroeconomic environment. 
 Other noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the same prior year period, primarily attributable to outsized commercial loan fees recorded during the third quarter of 2023, as well as decreased discounted purchases of Massachusetts historical tax credits, partially offset by unrealized gains on equity securities. Other noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was slightly higher than the same prior year period, primarily attributable to increased FHLB dividend income, realized gains on sales of equity securities, and commercial loan fees, partially offset by decreased discounted purchases of Massachusetts historical tax credits made during the first nine months of 2024.

 Noninterest Expense The following table sets forth information regarding non-interest expense for the periods shown:

 The primary reasons for the variances in the noninterest expense categories shown in the preceding table include: 
 Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to increases in general salaries, incentive programs, medical plan insurance, and payroll taxes. The 2024 third quarter increase also reflected the impact of an outsized interest rate-driven valuation fluctuation related to the Company s split-dollar bank-owned life insurance policies. These increases were partially offset by decreased commissions expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods. 
 Occupancy and equipment expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period due primarily to higher utilities costs and depreciation expense. Occupancy and equipment expenses were also higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period, driven primarily by one-time lease exit costs associated with acquired leased locations as well as increased depreciation expense and cleaning costs, partially offset by decreased utilities costs. 
 Software and subscriptions costs increased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by the Company s continued investment in its technology infrastructure.

Table of Contents 

 FDIC assessment was relatively flat for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same prior year quarter, and increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period due primarily to an increase in the estimated FDIC special assessment recognized by the Company during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Debit card expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a one-time credit of 1.1 million recognized during the third quarter of 2024 as well as reduced processing costs. 
 Consulting expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to the timing of strategic initiatives. 
 Other noninterest expense was lower for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods. The 2024 third quarter decrease was driven primarily by decreased unrealized losses on equity securities, lower card issuance costs, recruitment expenses and other miscellaneous costs, partially offset by increased software and subscriptions, internet banking expenses and telecommunications costs. The 2024 year-to-date decrease was driven primarily by lower recruitment expenses, reduced gains on sale of fixed assets, decreased legal costs, partially offset by increases in software and subscriptions, internet banking, and telecommunications costs. 

Income Taxes The tax effect of all income and expense transactions is recognized by the Company in each year s consolidated statements of income, regardless of the year in which the transactions are reported for income tax purposes. The following table sets forth information regarding the Company s tax provision and applicable tax rates for the periods indicated: 
 
 Table 16 - Tax Provision and Applicable Tax Rates 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30 September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Combined federal and state income tax provision 12,362 19,333 42,149 59,519 Effective income tax rate 22.35 24.12 22.88 24.37 Blended statutory tax rate 27.91 27.85 27.91 27.85 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 is lower as compared to the year ago period primarily due to lower pre-tax income as well as increased tax benefits from low income housing tax credits. The effective tax rates in the table above are lower than the blended statutory tax rates due to the impact of discrete items, including tax benefits related to low income housing tax credits and equity compensation, as well as certain tax preference assets such as life insurance policies, tax exempt bonds, and federal tax credits. 

The Company invests in various low income housing projects, which are real estate limited partnerships that acquire, develop, own and operate low and moderate-income housing developments. As a limited partner in these operating partnerships, the Company will receive tax credits and tax deductions for losses incurred by the underlying properties. The investments are accounted for using the proportional amortization method and will be amortized over various periods through 2040, which represents the period that the tax credits and other tax benefits will be utilized. The total committed investment in these partnerships is 258.3 million, of which 192.5 million had been funded as of September 30, 2024. It is expected that the limited partnership investments will generate a net tax benefit of approximately 3.8 million for the fiscal year 2024 and a total of 37.3 million over the remaining life of the investments from the combination of the tax credits and operating losses. 
 
 Risk Management 
 
 The Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Risk Appetite Statement to state the Company s goals and objectives in identifying, measuring, and managing the risks associated with the Company s current and near future anticipated size and complexity. Management is responsible for comprehensive enterprise risk management, and continually strives to adopt and implement practices that strike an appropriate balance between risk and reward and permit the achievement of strategic goals in a controlled environment. 
 
 The Company has implemented the three lines of defense enterprise risk management framework. The first line of defense are the executives in charge of business units, operational areas, and corporate functions who, sometimes assisted by management committees, teams, and working groups, own and manage risks. The second line of defense monitors and 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 provides risk management advice across all risk domains, and is comprised of the enterprise risk management department, with oversight from the Chief Risk Officer. The third line of defense is independent assurance performed by the Chief Internal Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, and by the Company's internal audit department. 
 
 The Board of Directors, with the assistance of its Risk Committee, oversees management s enterprise risk management practices. As risks must be taken to create value, the Board of Directors has approved a Risk Appetite Statement that defines the acceptable residual risk tolerances for the Company and the nine major risk types identified as having the potential to create significant adverse impacts on the Company, such as financial losses, reputational damage, legal or regulatory actions, failure to achieve strategic objectives, diminished customer experience, and/or cultural erosion. The nine major risk categories identified by the Company and addressed in the Risk Appetite Statement are strategic and emerging risk, culture risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, market and interest rate risk, operational risk, reputation risk, compliance risk, and technology and cyber risk, each of which is discussed below. 

Strategic and Emerging Risk Strategic and emerging risk is the risk arising from adverse strategic or business decisions, misalignment of strategic direction with the Company s mission and values, failure to execute strategies or tactics, or an inadequate adaptation or lack of responsiveness to industry and/or operating environment changes. Management seeks to mitigate strategic risk through strategic planning, frequent executive review of strategic plan progress, monitoring of competitors and technology, assessment of new products, new branches, and new business initiatives, customer advocacy, and crisis management planning. 

Culture Risk Culture risk is the risk arising from failed leadership and/or ineffective colleague engagement and workplace management that causes the Company to lose sight of core values and, through acts or omissions, damage the relationship-based culture that has been one of the foundations of the Company s consistent success. Management seeks to mitigate culture risk through effective employee relations, leadership that encourages continuous improvement, cultural development and reinforcement of core values, communication of clear ethical and behavioral standards, consistent enforcement of policies and programs, discipline of misbehavior, alignment of incentives and compensation, and by promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. 

Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk arising from the failure of a borrower or a counterparty to a contract to make payments as agreed, and includes the risks arising from inadequate collateral and mismanagement of loan concentrations. While the collateral securing loans may be sufficient in some cases to recover the amount due, in other cases the Company may experience significant credit losses that could have an adverse effect on its operating results. The Company makes assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and counterparties and the value of collateral for the repayment of loans. For further discussion regarding the credit risk and the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, see Note 3, Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit Quality within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this Report . 

Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the Company being unable to meet obligations when due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in available funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from a failure to recognize or address market condition changes that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly with minimal value loss. 
 
 The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, and the amortization, prepayment, and maturities of loans and securities. The Bank utilizes its extensive branch network to access retail customers who provide a base of in-market core deposits. These funds are principally comprised of demand deposits, interest checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. Interest rates, economic conditions, and competitive factors greatly influence deposit levels. 
 
 The Company s primary measure of short-term liquidity is the Total Basic Surplus/Deficit as a percentage of assets. This ratio, which is an analysis of the relationship between liquid assets plus available FHLB funding, less short-term liabilities relative to total assets, was within policy limits at September 30, 2024. The Total Basic Surplus/Deficit measure is affected primarily by changes in deposits, securities and short-term investments, loans, and borrowings. An increase in deposits, without a corresponding increase in nonliquid assets, will improve the Total Basic Surplus/Deficit measure, whereas, an increase in loans, with no increase in deposits, will decrease the measure. Other factors affecting the Total Basic Surplus/Deficit include FHLB collateral requirements, securities portfolio changes, and the mix of deposits. 
 
 The Company prioritizes core deposits as a primary funding source and continues to maintain a variety of available liquidity sources, including FHLB advances, and Federal Reserve borrowing capacity. These funding sources serve as a contingent source of liquidity and, when profitable lending and investment opportunities exist, the Company may access them 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 to provide the liquidity needed to grow the balance sheet. The amount and type of assets that the Company has available to pledge affects the Company's FHLB and Federal Reserve borrowing capacity. For example, a prime one-to-four family residential loan may provide 75 cents of borrowing capacity for every 1.00 pledged, whereas a pledged commercial loan may increase borrowing capacity in a lower amount. The Company s lending decisions, therefore, can also affect its liquidity position. 
 
 The Company may also have the ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or unsecured debt privately or publicly and has done so in the past. Additionally, the Company is able to enter into repurchase agreements or acquire brokered deposits at its discretion. The availability and cost of equity or debt on an unsecured basis is dependent on many factors, including the Company s financial position, the market environment, and the Company s credit rating. The Company monitors the factors that could affect its ability to raise liquidity through these channels. 

The following table depicts current and unused liquidity capacity from various sources as of the dates indicated: 
 
 Table 17 - Liquidity Sources 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Outstanding Additional Borrowing Capacity Outstanding Additional Borrowing Capacity (Dollars in thousands) Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (1) 600,521 2,121,680 1,105,541 1,577,746 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (2) 3,624,805 3,078,179 Unpledged Securities 546,861 1,187,882 Line of Credit 85,000 85,000 Junior subordinated debentures (3) 62,859 62,858 Subordinated debt (3) 49,980 Reciprocal deposits (3) 1,036,580 959,068 Brokered deposits (3) 61,216 100,923 1,761,176 6,378,346 2,278,370 5,928,807 
 
 (1) Loans and securities with a carrying value of 3.9 billion at each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were pledged to the FHLB of Boston. 
 (2) Loans and securities with a carrying value of 5.0 billion at September 30, 2024, and loans with a carrying value of 4.6 billion at December 31, 2023, were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston at each respective period. 
 (3) The additional borrowing capacity has not been assessed for these categories. 
 
 In addition to customary operational liquidity practices, the Board of Directors and management recognize the need to establish reasonable guidelines to manage a heightened liquidity risk environment. Catalysts for elevated liquidity risk can be Company-specific issues and/or systemic industry-wide events. Management is therefore responsible for instituting systems and controls designed to provide advanced detection of potentially significant funding shortages, establishing methods for assessing and monitoring risk levels, and instituting responses that may alleviate or circumvent a potential liquidity crisis. Management has established a Liquidity Contingency Plan to provide a framework to detect potential liquidity problems and appropriately address them in a timely manner. In a period of perceived heightened liquidity risk, the Liquidity Contingency Plan provides for the establishment of a Liquidity Crisis Task Force to monitor the potential for a liquidity crisis and execute an appropriate response. 
 
 The Company continually monitors both on and off balance sheet liquidity sources to understand vulnerabilities and when adjustments to the balance between sources and uses of funds may be necessary. Management regularly performs various liquidity stress testing scenarios and other analyses to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding concerns resulting from economic or industry disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, or unforeseen credit events. The results of these scenarios are used to inform the Company's Liquidity Contingency Plan and help provide the basis for its liquidity needs. 

Market and Interest Rate Risk Market risk refers to the risk of potential losses arising from changes in interest rates and the value of investments due to market conditions or other external factors or events. Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk to which the Company has exposure to due to the nature of its operations. 
 
 Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes, as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of assets and liabilities, affect net interest income, which is the Company s primary source of revenue. 
 84 

Table of Contents 

 Interest rate risk arises directly from the Company s core banking activities. In addition to directly affecting net interest income, changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the amount of loans originated, the timing of cash flows on loans and securities, and the fair value of securities and derivatives, and have other effects. 
 
 Management strives to control interest rate risk within limits approved by the Board of Directors that reflect the Company s tolerance for interest rate risk over short-term and long-term horizons. The Company attempts to manage interest rate risk by identifying, quantifying, and, where appropriate, hedging exposure. If assets and liabilities do not re-price simultaneously and in equal volume, the potential for interest rate exposure exists. It is the Company's objective to maintain stability in the growth of net interest income through the maintenance of an appropriate mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and, when necessary within limits management deems prudent, with hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, floors, and caps. 
 
 The Company quantifies its interest rate exposures using net interest income simulation models, as well as simpler gap analysis, and an Economic Value of Equity analysis. Key assumptions in these analyses relate to behavior of interest rates and behavior of the Company s deposit and loan customers. The most material assumptions relate to the prepayment of mortgage assets (including mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities) and the life and sensitivity of non-maturity deposits e.g. , demand deposit, savings, and money market accounts). In the case of prepayment of mortgage assets, assumptions are derived from published median prepayment estimates for comparable mortgage loans. The risk of prepayment tends to increase when interest rates fall. Since future prepayment behavior of loan customers is uncertain, interest rate sensitivity of loans cannot be determined with precision and actual behavior may differ from assumptions to a significant degree. Non-maturity deposits, assumptions over customer behavior, shifts in deposits categories, and magnitude of impact to the cost of deposits all may differ from what is currently anticipated by the models or analyses. 
 
 Given the volatility associated with market rates, and the uncertainty surrounding future rate movements, management has been proactive in achieving a more neutral interest rate risk position as compared to the prior year. The Company runs several scenarios to quantify and effectively assist in managing interest rate risk, including instantaneous parallel shifts in market rates as well as gradual (12-24 months) shifts in market rates, and may also include other alternative scenarios as management deems necessary given the interest rate environment. The results of those scenarios are summarized in the following table: 

Table 18 - Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 September 30 2024 2023 Year 1 Year 1 Parallel rate shocks (basis points) -300 (6.4) (3.4) -200 (3.9) (1.9) -100 (1.5) (0.8) +100 1.1 0.2 +200 2.0 0.2 +300 3.0 0.7 +400 4.1 1.2 Gradual rate shifts (basis points) -200 over 12 months (1.3) (0.7) -100 over 12 months (0.6) (0.3) +200 over 12 months 0.9 0.2 
 
 The results depicted in the table above are dependent on material assumptions, such as prepayment rates, decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and other factors, which management believes are reasonable. These assumptions may be impacted by customer preferences or competitive influences and therefore actual experience may differ from the assumptions in the model. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of the Company's interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates, and actual results may differ. 
 85 

Table of Contents 

The most significant market factors affecting the Company s net interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were the shape of the U.S. Government securities and interest rate swap yield curve, the U.S. prime interest rate, the secured overnight financing rate, and other interest rates offered on long-term fixed rate loans. 
 
 The Company manages the interest rate risk inherent in both its loan and borrowing portfolios by using interest rate swap agreements and interest rate caps and floors. An interest rate swap is an agreement in which one party agrees to pay a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount in exchange for receiving a fixed rate of interest on the same notional amount for a predetermined period from the other party. Interest rate caps and floors are agreements where one party agrees to pay a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount for a predetermined period to a second party if certain market interest rate thresholds are realized. While interest is paid or received in swap, cap, and floors agreements, the notional principal amount is not exchanged. The Company may also manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage banking operations by entering into forward sales contracts under which the Company agrees to deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors. See Note 5, Derivative and Hedging Activities within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this Report for additional information regarding the Company s derivative financial instruments. 
 
 Movements in foreign currency rates or commodity prices do not directly or materially affect the Company's earnings. Movements in equity prices may have a modest impact on earnings by affecting the volume of activity or the amount of fees from investment-related business lines. See Note 2, Securities within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this Report. 

Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk arising from human error or misconduct, transaction errors or delays, inadequate or failed internal systems or processes, data unavailability, loss, or poor quality, or adverse external events. Operational risk includes fraud risk and model risk. Potential operational risk exposure exists throughout the Company. The continued effectiveness of colleagues and operational infrastructure are integral to mitigating operational risk, and any shortcomings subject the Company to risks that vary in size, scale and scope. 

Reputation Risk Reputation risk is the risk arising from negative public opinion of the Company and the Bank. Management seeks to mitigate reputational risk through actions that include a structured process of customer complaint resolution and ongoing reputational monitoring. 

Regulatory and Compliance Risk Regulatory and Compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of laws or regulations, non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal bank policies and procedures, or ethical standards. Compliance risk includes consumer compliance risk, legal risk, and regulatory compliance risk. Management seeks to mitigate compliance risk through compliance training and regulatory change management processes. 

Technology and Cyber Risk Technology and Cyber risk is the risk of losses or other impacts arising from the failure of technology systems to function in accordance with expectations and business requirements. Technology risks include technical failures, unlawful tampering with technical systems, cyber security, terrorist activities, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support. Management seeks to mitigate technology risk through appropriate security and controls over data and its technological environment. The Bank manages cybersecurity threats proactively and maintains robust controls to protect its critical systems and data by investing in secure, reliable and resilient technology infrastructure, fostering a culture of technology risk awareness and continuously improving its technology risk management practices.
