 million one-time cash payment (the Payment ), which the Company received in April 2023. At the time of cancellation, no product units had been delivered under the Cancelled PO s and the Company had two other open purchase orders from the same customer for the same product Open PO s ). The Company originally accounted for the Cancelled PO s as a single contract and recognized the million payment as component of product revenue in the first quarter of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company reassessed the accounting treatment of the Payment and concluded that the Cancelled PO s and Open PO s represented a combined contract such that the February 2023 transaction should have been analyzed and accounted for as a contract modification, which required the Payment to be deferred and recognized as product units were delivered under the Open PO s the "Misstatement"). All Open PO product units were fully delivered to the customer by June 30, 2024. The correction of the error affects certain financial statement line items in both the three and nine month periods ended September 2023 included in these condensed consolidated financial statements, including but not limited to product revenues, income tax provision, foreign currency translation, deferred revenues, prepaid expenses, deferred taxes and earnings-per-share. Consolidated Financial Statements - Restatement Reconciliation Tables The following tables present the impact of the financial statement adjustments on the Company's previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements. The "Previously Reported" amounts in the following tables are amounts derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 22, 2024, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, originally filed with the SEC on October 31, 2023. The amounts in the columns labeled "Revenue Adjustments" represent the effect of adjustments resulting from the correction of the overstatement of revenues associated with the Payment and related tax impact. The amounts in the columns labeled "Other Adjustments" represent the effect of other adjustments that relate to other unrelated errors in previously filed financial statements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to those filed financial statements. The effects of both the restatement for the Revenue Adjustments and the Other Adjustments have been corrected in all impacted tables and footnotes throughout these condensed consolidated financial statements.

These funds are valued on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. Contingent Consideration Earnouts As of September 30, 2024 , the maximum amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to pay in connection with completed acquisitions is: million over a three-year earnout period for Avitide, Inc. Avitide ), which was acquired in September 2021 and for which the earnout periods run from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024; million over a two-year earnout period for FlexBiosys, Inc. FlexBiosys ), which was acquired in April 2023 and for which the earnout periods run from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024; and approximately million over a one-year earnout period for Metenova Holding AB Metenova ), which was acquired in October 2023 and for which the earnout period runs from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. See Note 4, Acquisitions to this report for additional information on the contingent consideration earnouts. Since the date of acquisition, expected results and changes in market inputs used to calculate the discount rate related to Avitide, FlexBiosys and Metenova, have, at times, resulted in changes in amounts reported as the Company s contingent consideration obligation. As of September 30, 2024, management assessed the remaining contingent consideration obligation balances and the existing market inputs used and decided that no changes in fair value were required.

Severance and employee-related costs under the Restructuring Plan are primarily associated with actual headcount reductions. Costs incurred include cash severance and non-cash severance, including other termination benefits. Severance and other termination benefit packages are based on established benefit arrangements or local statutory requirements and we recognized the contractual component of these benefits when payment was probable and could be reasonably estimated. The inventory write-off in 2023 includes the impact of the Company discontinuing the sale of certain product SKUs and the impact of having proactively secured materials during the COVID-19 Period to meet accelerated demand during a challenging supply chain environment in the industry. Where demand has reduced, finished goods and raw materials, the value of which exceeded the projected requirements to be used before reaching their expiration date, were written down to their realizable value. The 2023 Restructuring Plan also includes the closing of manufacturing facilities and production lines, which include inventory that could not be re-purposed. Non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation were recognized on long-lived assets that were taken out of service before the end of their normal service due to the shutdown of manufacturing facilities and production lines, in which case depreciation estimates were revised to reflect the use of the assets over their shortened useful life. The restructuring accrual is included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

When disaggregating revenue, the Company considered all of the economic factors that may affect its revenues. Because its revenues are from bioprocessing customers, there are no differences in the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows from any of its product lines. However, given that the Company s revenues are generated in different geographic regions, factors such as regulatory, economic and geopolitical developments within those regions could impact the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows. Disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region and revenue from significant customers can be found in Note 15, Segment Reporting, included in this report.

1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 On December 14, 2023, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 Notes in the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2019 Notes and certain other qualified institutional 

 22 

million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes in a private placement to accredited institutional buyers (the Subscription Transactions for million in cash. The Company evaluated the Exchange Transaction and determined approximately million of the million principal of the exchanged 2019 Notes should be accounted for as extinguishments of debt and approximately million should be accounted for as modification of debt. As a result, the Company recognized a million loss on extinguishments of debt in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023, inclusive of million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under debt modification accounting, the carrying amount of the modified 2019 Notes was reduced by million, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital, to account for the increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option, representing a debt discount of the modified 2019 Notes. The aggregate debt discount of million as of September 30, 2024, comprised of million increase in principal of the modified 2019 Notes and a million increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option. The aggregate debt discount of million as of December 31, 2023, comprised of million increase in principal of the modified 2019 Notes and a million increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option. These amounts are presented as a direct reduction from the carrying value of the convertible debt in their respective periods presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. This amount is being accreted into interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) using the effective interest method over the term of the 2023 Notes. Proceeds from the Subscription Transactions were million, net of debt issuance costs of million. The Exchange Transaction resulted in million of the debt issuance costs related to the modified 2019 Notes, which were expensed as incurred in accordance with debt modification accounting, and million of deferred debt issuance costs related to the 2023 Notes, which were recorded as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the 2023 Notes on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company is amortizing the million of debt issuance costs of the 2023 Notes into amortization of debt issuance costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) over the remaining term of the 2023 Notes. The carrying value of the 2023 Notes of million and million is included in long-term debt on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company used million of the proceeds from the Subscription Transactions to repurchase shares of its common stock from certain purchasers of the 2023 Notes. For more information regarding this repurchase, see Note 13, Stockholders Equity - Share Repurchases included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the Company's Form 10-K/A. The Company also used a portion of the proceeds to finance in part, the settlement upon redemption of the remaining 2019 Notes at maturity. The remainder of the proceeds will be used for working capital. The 2023 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and bear interest at a rate of per year. . The 2023 Notes will mature on , unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. During the third quarter of 2024, the closing price of the Company s common stock did not exceed of the conversion price of the 2023 Notes for more than trading days of the last consecutive trading of the quarter. As a result, the 2023 Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders of the 2023 Notes during the fourth quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. Because the 2023 Notes were not convertible as of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to classify the carrying value of the 2023 Notes of million as noncurrent liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. The initial conversion rate for the 2023 Notes is shares of the Company s common stock per principal amount of 2023 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share and represents a premium over the last reported sale price of per share on December 6, 2023, the date on which the 2023 Notes were priced. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028, the 2023 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of 2023 Notes only upon the satisfaction of the specified conditions mentioned above and during certain quarters commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024, into cash up to their principal amount, and into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company s election, for the conversion value above the principal amount, if any. Thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the 2023 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of 2023 Notes at any time regardless of these conditions. The Company may redeem for cash, all or a portion of the 2023 Notes, at its option, on or after December 18, 2026 and prior to the 21 st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to,

The fair value of the 2023 Notes was determined based on the most recent trade activity of the 2023 Notes at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 The Company issued million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes on July 19, 2019 in a transaction which included the underwriters exercise in full of an option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes (the Notes Offering ). The net proceeds of the Notes Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other related offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately million. Immediately following the closing of the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2023. During 2024, million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes converted, bringing the remaining outstanding 2019 Notes to million in aggregate principal amount. The remaining 2019 Notes matured and were paid off in full on July 15, 2024. As mentioned above, the Company used net proceeds from the Exchange Transaction to fund the repayment of the 2019 Notes at maturity and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes. The Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion of the 2019 Notes using a combination of cash and the Company s common stock, settling the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. In connection with the conversion, the Company paid million in cash, which included principal and accrued interest, and issued shares of the Company s common stock representing the conversion premium. For more information on the 2023 Notes, see Note 15, Convertible Senior Notes, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the Company s Form 10-K/A.

Former Chief Executive Officer Accounting Modifications On June 12, 2024, upon approval by the Board, the Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the Transition Agreement with the Company's former Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Tony J. Hunt, which amends and restates Mr. Hunt's Third Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with the Company dated as of May 26, 2022. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, Mr. Hunt relinquished his position as the Company's CEO effective September 1, 2024 (the Transition Date and transitioned to a new role as Executive Chair of the Board beginning on the Transition Date (the CEO Transition ). It is anticipated that Mr. Hunt will continue to be involved in the business as the Executive Chair of the Board until March 2026 and will continue to be employed by the Company as an advisor thereafter, until March 2027. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement and the award agreements governing Mr. Hunt s outstanding equity awards, Mr. Hunt s unvested stock awards will continue to vest in accordance with their original terms. Furthermore, on June 28, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the 2024 Award Amendment to the equity awards granted to Mr. Hunt in 2024, which consisted of a stock option, restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs and together the 2024 Grants ). Pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Award Amendment, two-thirds of the 2024 Grants were forfeited, which equates to shares of the Company s common stock. Although Mr. Hunt s unvested equity awards continue to vest in accordance with their original terms and there has been no amendment to Mr. Hunt s outstanding equity awards other than the 2024 Award Amendment, the Company determined that under ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , the CEO Transition represented a significant reduction in Mr. Hunt s operating role with the Company for accounting purposes. This determination resulted in a Type III accounting modification of certain of Mr. Hunt s unvested stock awards (improbable to probable) under ASC 718 (the Equity Modification on June 12, 2024. As a result, for accounting purposes only, Mr. Hunt s unvested awards were deemed cancelled and a new grant issued for his unvested shares with the value of these awards recalculated using a price of per share, which was the opening stock price of the first day of trading following the public announcement of the CEO Transition. As a result of the Equity Modification, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for the modified awards of million over the remaining requisite service period, which the Company determined to be between June 13, 2024 and September 1, 2024 and represented the remaining service period of Mr. Hunt s role as CEO. The Company determined that the PSUs granted to Mr. Hunt in 2022 and 2023 should be accounted for as a Type IV accounting modification (improbable to improbable) in accordance with ASC 718, because vesting conditions before and after June 12, 2024 were improbable of being achieved. As a result of the Equity Modification and the forfeiture of the pro-rata portion of Mr. Hunt s 2024 Grants, the Company recognized million and million of incremental stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Stock Issued for Earnout Payments In April 2024, the Company issued shares of its common stock to former securityholders of Avitide to satisfy the contingent consideration obligation established under the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Avitide Agreement which the Company entered into as part of the acquisition of Avitide in September 2021. In March 2024, the Company issued shares of its common stock to former securityholders of FlexBiosys to satisfy the contingent consideration obligation established under the FlexBiosys Agreement, which the Company entered into as part of the acquisition of FlexBiosys in April 2023.

As the Company was in a net loss position for the three months ended September 30, 2024, shares of potentially dilutive options and stock units are considered anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, sh ares and shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares and were therefore anti-dilutive. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , shares and shares, respectively, were considered anti-dilutive. In July 2019, the Company issued 

 28 

million principal amount of 2023 Notes for million principal amount of 2019 Notes and issued million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes for million in cash. Immediately following the closing of the Exchange Transaction mentioned above, million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2023 with terms unchanged. During 2024, million aggregate principal amount converted, bringing the remaining outstanding 2019 Notes to million in aggregate principal amount. The remaining 2019 Notes matured and were paid off in full on July 15, 2024. As mentioned above and as provided by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture underlying the 2019 Notes, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion obligation for the 2019 Notes in a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock. This means the Company settled the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. The Company is required to reflect the dilutive effect of the convertible securities by application of the if-converted method, which means the denominator of the EPS calculation would include the total number of shares assuming the 2019 Notes had been fully converted at the beginning of the period. Accordingly, the par value of the 2019 Notes was not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, but the dilutive effect of the conversion premium was considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for any period the 2019 Notes were not matured, using the treasury stock method. The dilutive impact of the 2019 Notes was based on the difference between the Company s current period average stock price and the conversion price of the 2019 Notes, provided there was a premium. Because the remaining 2019 Notes were redeemed at September 30, 2024 as mentioned above, there was dilutive effect of the conversion premium included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the dilutive effect of the conversion premium included in the calculation of diluted earnings was shares and shares, respectively.

 Restatement 
 As previously described in the Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have restated our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, the previously reported financial information as of December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 in this Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been updated to reflect the relevant restatement. Refer to Note 1 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the adjustments and the impacts on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 As a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are therefore subject to non-U.S. exchange exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce our revenue and gross profit margin and impact the comparability of results from period to period. 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cost inflation, primarily in raw materials, and other supply chain costs, as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including global geopolitical conflicts and labor shortages. Actions taken to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation, including price increases and productivity improvements, have generally been successful in offsetting the impact of these trends. In addition, decreasing demand for vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic, including all subsequent variants of the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus is driving a reduction in future demand of our products related to these vaccines. 
 2024 Acquisition 
 Pending Acquisition of Tantti Laboratory Inc. 
 On July 29, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Tantti Laboratory Inc. Tantti ). Tantti, which is headquartered in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, is expected to accelerate our expansion into new modality markets with unique, scalable purification solutions for large molecule biologics. 
 31 

We expect the acquisition of Tantti to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including clearance through the Taiwanese regulatory channel. 
 2023 Acquisitions 
 Acquisition of FlexBiosys, Inc. 
 On April 17, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in FlexBiosys, Inc. FlexBiosys ), pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement with FlexBiosys, TSAP Holdings Inc. NJ Seller ), Gayle Tarry and Stanley Tarry, as individuals (collectively with NJ Seller, the Sellers ), and Stanley Tarry, in his capacity as the representative of the Sellers (the FlexBiosys Acquisition ). 
 FlexBiosys, which is headquartered in Branchburg, New Jersey, offers expert design and custom manufacturing of single-use bioprocessing products and a comprehensive range of products that include bioprocessing bags, bottles, and tubing assemblies. These products will complement and expand our fluid management portfolio of offerings. 
 Acquisition of Metenova Holding AB 
 On October 2, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in Metenova Holding AB Metenova ), pursuant to a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with, inter alia, Metenova for approximately 173 million in cash and the Company's equity. Metenova will further strengthen our fluid management portfolio with its magnetic mixing and drive train technologies that are widely used by global biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a description of our critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K/A. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto.

Product revenues 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, product revenue increased by 13.7 million, or 9.7 , and 1.2 million, or 0.2 , respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase in the three-month period is mainly due to the increase in revenue of 12.3 million from our filtration franchise. The increase in the nine-month period is primarily driven by growth in our filtration franchise of 27.5 million, offset by decreasing revenue in our Proteins and Chromatography franchises of 21.9 million and 6.6 million, respectively.

Royalty and other revenues 
 Royalty and other revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relate to royalties received from a third-party systems manufacturer associated with our OPUS chromatography columns. Royalty revenues are variable and are dependent on sales generated by our partners. 
 Costs of goods sold and operating expenses (As Restated)

Cost of goods sold 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 27.3 million, or 26.0 , and 34.7 million, or 13.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred specific restructuring charges, including a 17.2 million inventory write-off to adjust inventory to net realizable value, a 3.8 million charge for accelerated depreciation on equipment related to manufacturing facilities to be closed and 3.0 million in severance and other charges, as a result of the restructuring activities, which commenced in July 2023, for a total of 24.0 million. See Note 5, Restructuring Plan for more information on the Restructuring Plan. Cost of goods decreased further due to less materials consumed in the production process and reduction in overhead costs as a direct result of the restructuring activities. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of the restructuring charges accounted for in the three months ended September 30, 2023, material and overhead costs decreased by 5.0 million and labor costs increased by 1.7 million, compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of the restructuring charges accounted for in the three months ended September 30, 2023, material and overhead costs and labor costs decreased by 10.0 million and 0.7 million, respectively. 
 
 Gross margin was 50.0 and 25.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and gross margin was 50.5 and 42.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary driver of the margin improvement is the non-recurring restructuring charges incurred in the prior year, discussed earlier. In addition, we benefited from higher volume and year-over-year productivity, with some offset from inflation. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development R D expenses are related to the development of products supporting bioprocessing operations. The expenses include personnel compensation, supplies, and other research expenses. Due to the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs, we have not provided historical costs incurred by project. 
 R D expenses decreased 0.9 million, or 8.2 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in product development and R D research services of 0.6 million. 
 R D expenses decreased 0.9 million, or 2.8 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023, due to the reduction in R D research services of 1.6 million and laboratory and other R D supplies of 1.2 million, offset by increased payroll and consulting costs of 1.5 million. 
 33 

R D expense also includes payments made to expand our proteins product offering through our agreement with Navigo Proteins GmbH Navigo ). Such expenses were 1.1 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.8 million and 3.1 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023, in the form of milestone payments to Navigo. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include the costs associated with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our marketing efforts. It also includes legal, accounting, patent, shareholder services, amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions. 
 SG A costs increased by 20.0 million, or 36.0 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 41.9 million, or 26.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 One of the primary drivers of this increase was the incremental stock compensation expense of 17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, associated with the modification of our former Chief Executive Officer s CEO unvested equity awards resulting from the announcement of his transition from CEO to Executive Chair of our Board, which was announced on June 12, 2024 and effective September 1, 2024. For more information on the former CEO s transition to Executive Chair of our Board, see Note 10, Stockholders Equity - Chief Executive Officer Accounting Modifications included in this report. 
 Excluding the impact of the incremental stock compensation expense mentioned above, SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.6 million which is predominantly driven by increased incentive and commission expenses of 2.1 million and incremental intangible asset amortization of 1.0 million. 
 Excluding the impact of the incremental stock compensation expense mentioned above, SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 19.5 million which is predominantly driven by increased incentive and commission expenses of 9.8 million, incremental salary expense of 5.2 million and incremental intangible asset amortization of 3.2 million. 
 The increase in SG A costs also reflects the results of the operations of FlexBiosys and Metenova, which have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition dates in April 2023 and October 2023, respectively. 
 Contingent consideration 
 Contingent consideration expense represents the change in fair value of the contingent consideration obligation included in current and noncurrent contingent consideration on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of the end of each period. Remeasurement of the contingent consideration obligation is done each quarter and the carrying value of the obligation is adjusted to the current fair value through our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Expected results and a change in market inputs used to calculate the discount rate, resulted in a change reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of (34.3) million and (31.3) million, respectively. No adjustment was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as management s assessment was that the balances of the contingent consideration obligations already represented fair value.

Investment income 
 Investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances. Our investment income increased by 2.5 million and 9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023 due to an increase in interest rates on higher average invested cash balances since September 30, 2023. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in interest earned on U.S. treasury bills purchased at the end of 2022, for which there was no comparable amount recorded in 2024. We expect investment income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily from contractual coupon interest on the convertible debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. On December 14, 2023, we entered into a privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreement with certain holders of our 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2019 Notes and certain new investors pursuant to which we issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2023 Notes ). Interest expense of the 2019 Notes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was immaterial. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million of interest on the 2019 Notes, compared to 0.3 million and 0.8 million, respectively of interest expense on the 2019 Notes in the same periods of 2023. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes 1.5 million and 4.5 million, respectively, of contractual coupon interest on the 2023 Notes as well as 3.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively, in accretion of the 82.1 million debt discount on the modified notes, which includes the accretion of an increase in principal and the accretion of increased fair value of the conversion option for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for which there were no comparable costs in the same periods of 2023. See Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on this transaction. 
 Amortization of debt issuance costs 
 Transaction costs related to the issuance of the 2019 Notes and the 2023 Notes are amortized to amortization of debt issuance costs on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization of debt issuance costs included 0.2 million of amortization of costs related to the 2019 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization of debt issuance costs included 0.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively, of amortization of costs related to the 2023 Notes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amortization of debt issuance costs included 0.5 million and 1.4 million, respectively, of amortization related to the 2019 Notes. 
 Other (expenses) income 
 The change in other (expenses) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, is primarily attributable to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to transactions with customers and vendors, as well as the revaluation impact of intercompany loans with subsidiaries. 
 Income tax provision (As Restated) 
 Income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of (0.5) million and an income tax expense of 3.2 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was 43.0 and 27.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and is based upon the estimated income for the year ending December 31, 2024 and the composition of income in different jurisdictions. The difference in effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to lower income before income taxes, nondeductible stock compensation and nonrecurring tax benefits from nontaxable contingent consideration and a deductible foreign exchange loss on certain long-term intercompany debt. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to nondeductible stock compensation partially offset by stock windfall tax benefits. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax benefit of (5.5) million and an income tax expense of 2.8 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was (48.7 and 5.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and is based upon the estimated income for the year ending December 31, 2023 and the composition of income in different jurisdictions. The difference in effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to lower income before income taxes and increased benefits from business tax credits, nontaxable contingent consideration and a deductible foreign exchange loss on certain long-term intercompany debt, partially offset by lower foreign-derived intangible income and nondeductible executive compensation. Our effective tax rates for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to business tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income, windfall tax benefits on stock option exercise and the vesting of stock units, nontaxable contingent consideration and a deductible foreign exchange loss on certain long-term intercompany debt. 
 In 2021, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 . We continue to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a resulting material impact to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources (Restated) 
 We have financed our operations primarily through revenues derived from product sales, the issuance of the 2019 Notes in July 2019, the 2023 Notes in December 2023 and the issuance of common stock in our December 2020, July 2019 and May 2019 public offerings. Our revenue for the foreseeable future will primarily be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue. 
 On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. Subsequently, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that SVB depositors would have access to all of their money. We have a banking relationship with SVB and hold cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024 in SVB depository accounts to cover short-term operational payments. While we have not experienced any losses in such accounts, the failure of SVB in 2023 caused us to utilize our accounts at other financial institutions in order to mitigate potential operational risks stemming from the temporary inability to access funds in our SVB operating accounts. As a result of bank failures, such as SVB, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired and could negatively impact the financial institutions with which we have direct arrangements, or the financial services industry or economy in general. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 784.0 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 751.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Working capital increased by 76.8 million to 1,023.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 946.4 million at December 31, 2023 due to the various changes noted below. 
 36 

On December 14, 2023, the Company issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 Notes in a private placement pursuant to separate, privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreements (the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of holders of its outstanding 2019 Notes and certain other qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities Act ). Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements, the Company exchanged 217.7 million of its 2019 Notes for 309.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Exchange Transaction and issued 290.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes (the Subscription Transactions for 290.1 million in cash. Proceeds from the Subscription Transactions amounted to 276.1 million after debt issuance costs of 13.9 million. The 2023 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and bear interest at a rate of 1.00 per year. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2024. The 2023 Notes will mature on December 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. During the third quarter of 2024, the closing price of the Company's common stock did not exceed 130 of the conversion price of the 2023 Notes for more than 20 trading days of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter. As a result, the 2023 Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders of the 2023 Notes during the fourth quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. For more information on the 2023 Notes, see Note 9, "Convertible Senior Notes," to this report. 
 The remaining 2019 Notes matured and were paid off in full on July 15, 2024. As mentioned above, the Company used net proceeds from the Exchange Transaction to fund the repayment of the 2019 Notes at maturity and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes. The Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion of the 2019 Notes using a combination of cash and the Company s common stock, settling the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. In connection with the conversion, the Company paid 69.6 million in cash, which included principal and accrued interest, and issued 100,942 shares of the Company s common stock representing the conversion premium.

Operating activities (As Restated) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities provided cash of 136.2 million reflecting net income of 8.4 million and non-cash charges totaling 113.3 million primarily related to depreciation and intangible amortization, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and operating lease right of use asset amortization. Accounts receivable increased by 4.6 million, while inventory manufactured decreased by 20.1 million. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities had a net increase of 7.1 million, primarily due to an increase in unearned revenue and accrued employee payroll and bonuses, and there was a net increase in operating lease liability due to new operating leases entered into during 2024 providing cash of 5.8 million. Prepaid expenses increased by 1.8 million, primarily related to prepayment of corporate taxes. The remaining cash used in operating activities resulted from unfavorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operating activities provided cash of 84.9 million reflecting net income of 52.0 million and non-cash charges totaling 40.7 million primarily related to depreciation and amortization, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, deferred income taxes, non-cash interest income, stock-based compensation charges and operating lease right of use asset amortization. A decrease in accounts receivable provided 8.3 million of cash and was primarily driven by lower revenue. Additionally, we had a decrease in inventory manufactured that provided 26.0 million of which 17.2 million was related to the Restructuring Plan. An increase in prepaid expenses, primarily related to prepaid taxes and subscriptions consumed 12.7 million. A decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses consumed 21.3 million and was due to the timing of payments to vendors as well as the payment of employee bonuses related to 2022 during the nine months 
 37 

ended September 30, 2023. The remaining cash provided by operating activities resulted from favorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 Investing activities 
 Our investing activities consumed 21.6 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily driven by capital expenditures of 22.9 million during 2024. Included in this amount were capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our investing activities provided 46.6 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the maturity of our short-term investment in U.S. treasury securities in June 2023, which provided cash of 102.3 million. We used 27.8 million in cash (net of cash received) for the FlexBiosys Acquisition. Capital expenditures consumed 27.8 million in 2023 as we continue to increase our manufacturing capacity worldwide. Of these expenditures, 2.7 million represented capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 Our financing activities consumed 84.4 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by the settlement of the 2019 Notes of 69.9 million, of which 69.6 million occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024. A further 9.4 million was disbursed in cash for shares withheld to cover employee income tax due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units, and the payments of 2.2 million and 5.2 million to settle the cash portion of the contingent earnout obligations related to our acquisition of FlexBiosys in April 2023 and Avitide in September 2021, respectively. These payments were partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period. 
 Our financing activities consumed 19.2 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily for 12.2 million in cash disbursed for shares withheld to cover employee income tax due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and the payment of 7.3 million to settle the cash portion of the First Earnout Year contingent earnout obligation related to our acquisition of Avitide in September 2021. This was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period. 
 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is a result of using multiple currencies across the group, with the Euro and Swedish Krona being significant currencies for the group outside of the US Dollar. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 the expansion of our bioprocessing business; 

the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products and successfully integrate them into our business; 

our ability to acquire additional bioprocessing products; 

the scope of and progress made in our R D activities; 

the scope of investment in our intellectual property portfolio; 

contingent consideration earnout payments resulting from our acquisitions; 

the extent of any share repurchase activity; 

the success of any proposed financing efforts; 

general economic and capital markets; 

change in accounting standards; 

the impact of inflation on our operations, including our expenditures on raw materials and freight charges; 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 

costs associated with our ability to comply with, emerging environmental, social and governance standards. 

Absent acquisitions of additional products, product candidates or intellectual property and absent the need to satisfy any debt conversions, we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 24 months from the 
 38 

date of this filing. We expect operating expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year to increase as we continue to expand our bioprocessing business. We expect to incur continued spending related to the development and expansion of our bioprocessing product lines and expansion of our commercial capabilities for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements may include, but are not limited to, purchases of property, plant and equipment, the acquisition of additional bioprocessing products and technologies to complement our existing manufacturing capabilities and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio. 
 We plan to continue to invest in our bioprocessing business and in key R D activities associated with the development of new bioprocessing products. We actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including acquiring products, technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio. We continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders. In order to acquire such assets, we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments. If our available cash balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of any such acquisition-related financing needs, the need to fund debt conversions, or due to lower demand for our products, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt funding. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders, and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (As Restated) 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of 31.1 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of 4.8 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 4.9 million. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2043, while the federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards have unlimited carryforward periods and do not expire. We had federal and state business tax credits carryforwards of 5.8 million available to reduce future federal and state income taxes. The business tax credits carryforwards will expire at various dates through December 2043. Net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service, state and foreign jurisdictions and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 Our assets are primarily monetary, consisting mainly of cash and cash equivalents. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, furniture, fixtures and office equipment, computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources.

Further information on potential risk factors that could affect our financial results are included in the filings made by us from time to time with the SEC including under the sections entitled Risk Factors in our Form 10-K/A. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUAL ITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material changes to our market risk exposure during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AN D PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate DCPs (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). DCPs are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company carried out an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s DCPs pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based on such evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the previously reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are described in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be 
 40 

prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2023 and disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K/A, the Company identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 
 1. A material weakness in the operation of our controls over the deferred income tax accounting for complex and non-routine transactions. Specifically, management did not have adequate supervision and review controls over the complex accounting for deferred income tax on the exchange of our outstanding 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 and the issuance of 1.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, including work performed by external advisors and the internal review of such transaction and related analyses. 

2. In connection with the restatement of the Company s financial statements, a material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of controls related to revenue recognition specific to the evaluation of accounting for contract terms. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not remediated these material weaknesses. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses 
 As previously disclosed in the Form 10-K/A, management is implementing remedial actions under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to address the identified deficiencies. 
 Our income tax remediation efforts include the following activities: 
 Improving our process to identify and select qualified third-party advisors, including enhanced review of capabilities and work performed, specifically related to the review of tax advice and related accounting guidance. 

Implementing a process to verify the controls, processes and internal reviews performed by third-party advisors. 

Considering whether the non-routine transaction warrants additional advisor oversight or validation of analyses based on complexity or changes in applicable regulations. 

Increasing education for internal resources on complex transactions to enhance diligence capabilities with third-party advisors. 

Our revenue recognition remediation efforts include the following activities: 
 Designing new internal controls to validate there is a complete listing of revenue contracts that have non-standard terms, which require incremental accounting analysis under ASC 606. 

Designing new internal controls evaluating the accounting for contract amendments, including amendments accounted for as contract modifications. 

Enhancing and expanding our existing revenue recognition control procedures and attributes when evaluating the accounting impact of non-standard contract terms and contract modifications. 

Increasing education for internal resources on accounting for contracts within the scope of ASC 606 and deploying enablers to facilitate documentation of accounting analyses and conclusions. 

We will continue to monitor the design and operating effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management determines appropriate. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 Except for the material weaknesses described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 41 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEG AL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently aware of any such proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, nor are we aware of any governmental proceedings involving potential monetary sanctions of 0.3 million or more. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q include forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are based on various assumptions by management regarding future circumstances, over many of which Repligen has little or no control. A number of important risks and uncertainties, including those identified under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 31, 2023 Form 10-K/A and in subsequent filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. 
 As contemplated in Item 1A, entitled Risk Factors, in the Company's Form 10-K/A, the Company has in the past and may in the future experience data security incidents. If successful, these attacks could affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. The Company is updating the risk factor captioned Our internal computer systems, or those of our customers, collaborators or other contractors, may be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs to reference the following incident: 
 As described on the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 15, 2024, on July 9, 2024, the Company discovered that an unauthorized third party had accessed certain files on the Company s information systems. Based on information currently known as of the date of this Form 10-Q and management s current assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors (including reputational harm, adverse impacts on relationships with vendors, customers and other business partners, and the impact of the foregoing on the Company s stockholders), the Company does not believe this incident will have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as of the date this Form 10-Q other than the Company s response and remediation activities, the incident has not had an impact on the Company s business or operations. 
 Other than the foregoing, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, entitled Risk Factors, in the Company s Form 10-K/A. 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQU I TY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 None. 
 ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SEN IOR SECURITIES 
 None. 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DI SCLOSURES 
 Not applicable. 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INF ORMATION 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 None of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) , , or a Rule 10(b)5-1 trading arrangement during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024.
