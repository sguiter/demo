NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company utilizes third-party sources to value its investment securities; securities individually valued using quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy, and securities valued using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities (commonly referred to as matrix pricing) are classified as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy. The Company validates the reliability of third-party provided values by comparing individual security pricing for securities between more than one third-party source. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by Management and classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

The Company follows the guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Investing in Securities without Reliance on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Agencies (SR 12-15) and other regulatory guidance when performing investment security pre-purchase analysis or evaluating investment securities for credit loss. Credit ratings issued by recognized rating agencies are considered in the Company s analysis only as a guide to the historical default rate associated with similarly-rated bonds. 

To the extent that debt securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio share common risk characteristics, estimated expected credit losses are calculated in a manner like that used for loans held for investment. That is, for pools of such securities with common risk characteristics, the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default is derived or obtained from external sources and adjusted for the expected effects of reasonable and supportable forecasts over the expected lives of the securities on those historical credit losses. Expected credit loss on each security in the held-to-maturity portfolio that does not share common risk characteristics with any of the pools of debt securities is individually evaluated and a reserve for credit losses is established based on the Company s consideration of the history of credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero. Therefore, for those securities, the Company does not record expected credit losses. 

Available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for credit related loss at least quarterly. For available for sale debt securities, a decline in fair value due to credit loss results in recording an allowance for credit losses to the extent the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses, such as declines due to changes in market interest rates, are recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Although these evaluations involve significant judgment, an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally considered to not be related to credit when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in risk-free interest rates, there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company does not intend to sell nor does it believe it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its cost basis. 

If the Company intends to sell a debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to its fair value and the write down is charged against the allowance for credit losses with any incremental loss reported in earnings. 

Purchase premiums are amortized to the earliest call date and purchase discounts are amortized to maturity as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Unamortized premiums, unaccreted discounts, and early payment premiums are recognized as a component of gain or loss on sale upon disposition of the related security. Interest and dividend income are recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale debt securities are included in earnings using the specific identification method. 

Accrued interest is recorded in other assets and is excluded from the estimation of expected credit loss. Accrued interest is reversed through interest income when amounts are determined to be uncollectible, which generally occurs when the underlying receivable is placed on nonaccrual status or charged off. 

thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, follows. In accordance with GAAP, unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity securities have not been recognized in the Company s financial statements.

Expected amortizing principal payments of collateralized loan obligations can differ from actual cash flows because the securities can be called and paid-off. Expected maturities of mortgage-related securities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. In addition, such factors as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yield on the carrying value of mortgage-related securities.

Based upon the Company s September 30, 2024 evaluation, the unrealized losses on debt securities were caused by market conditions for these types of securities. Market interest rates are currently higher than the book yield of the securities, causing declines in bond values generally. The Company continually monitors interest rate changes, risk premium spread changes, credit rating changes for issuers of bonds owned, collateralized loan obligations collateral levels, and corporate bond issuers common stock price changes. All collateralized loan obligations, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and corporate securities were investment grade rated at September 30, 2024. 

The Company does not intend to sell any debt securities available for sale with a material unrealized loss and has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the debt securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. 

The Company evaluates held to maturity corporate securities individually, monitoring each issuer s financial condition, profitability, cash flows and credit rating agency conclusions. The Company has evaluated each issuer s historical financial performance and ability to service debt payments, including throughout and following the 2008-2009 recession. The Company has an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis continues to be zero. 

The fair values of debt securities could decline in the future if market interest rates rise, the general economy deteriorates, inflation increases, credit ratings decline, the issuers financial condition deteriorates, or the liquidity for debt securities declines. As a result, significant credit losses on debt securities may occur in the future. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s debt securities pledged had a carrying amount of thousand and thousand, respectively, primarily to secure public deposits, Federal Reserve Bank borrowings and securities sold under repurchase agreements.

The Company evaluates debt securities on a quarterly basis including changes in security ratings issued by rating agencies, changes in the financial condition of the issuer, collateral levels and, for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, delinquency and loss information with respect to the underlying collateral, changes in the levels of subordination for the Company s particular position within the repayment structure and remaining credit enhancement as compared to expected credit losses of the security. In addition to monitoring credit rating agency evaluations, Management performs its own evaluations regarding the credit worthiness of the issuer or the securitized assets underlying asset backed securities.

Agency mortgage-backed securities were assigned no credit loss allowance due to the perceived backing of government sponsored entities. Municipal securities were evaluated for risk of default based on credit rating and remaining term to maturity using Moody s risk of default factors; Moody s loss upon default factors were applied to the assumed defaulted principal amounts to estimate the amount for credit loss allowance. Corporate securities held to maturity were individually evaluated for expected credit loss by evaluating the issuer s financial condition, profitability, cash flows, and credit ratings. At September 30, 2024, no credit loss allowance was assigned to corporate securities held to maturity.

The Company s customers are primarily small businesses, professionals and consumers. Given the scale of these borrowers, corporate credit rating agencies do not evaluate the borrowers financial condition. The Bank maintains a Loan Review Department which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Loan Review Department performs independent evaluations of loans and validates management assigned credit risk grades on evaluated loans using grading standards employed by bank regulatory agencies. Loans judged to carry lower-risk attributes are assigned a pass grade, with a minimal likelihood of loss. Loans judged to carry higher-risk attributes are referred to as classified loans, and are further disaggregated, with increasing expectations for loss recognition, as substandard, doubtful, and loss. The Loan Review Department performs continuous evaluations throughout the year. If the Bank becomes aware of deterioration in a borrower s performance or financial condition between Loan Review Department examinations, assigned risk grades are re-evaluated promptly. Credit risk grades assigned by management and validated by the Loan Review Department are subject to review by the Bank s regulatory authorities during regulatory examinations.

The Company owns thousand shares of Visa Inc. Visa Class B-1 common stock, which have transfer restrictions; the carrying value is - - thousand. Following the resolution of certain litigation involving Visa, shares of Visa s Class B-1 stock will convert to shares of Visa Class A common stock based on a conversion factor as of September 30, 2024), which is periodically adjusted to reflect Visa s ongoing litigation costs. Given the transfer restrictions and continuing uncertainty regarding the likelihood, ultimate timing and eventual conversion of Visa Class B-1 common stock for shares of Visa Class A common stock or other marketable classes of Visa common stock, these shares are not considered to have a readily determinable fair value and have no carrying value. Visa Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange and had a closing price of per share on September 30, 2024, the last trading day for the third quarter 2024. The ultimate value of the Company s Visa Class B-1 shares is subject to the extent of Visa s future litigation escrow fundings, the resulting conversion rate to Visa Class A common stock, and current and future transfer restrictions on the Visa Class B-1 common stock. Effective January 24, 2024, all outstanding shares of Visa Class B common stock, including 211 thousand Visa Class B shares then held by the Company, were redenominated as Visa Class B-1 common stock. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, Visa conducted an exchange offer under which Visa Class B-1 stockholders could elect to exchange a portion of their Visa Class B-1 shares for a combination of Visa Class C common stock, which is convertible into publicly traded Visa Class A common stock, and Visa Class B-2 common stock, which remains restricted. The Company did not exchange any Visa Class B-1 shares in the exchange offer, which expired on May 3, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company did not record an adjustment to the carrying value of the Visa Class B-1 shares.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had access to borrowing from the Federal Reserve up to thousand based on the collateral pledged at September 30, 2024. The Company repaid Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program borrowings in the amount of thousand during the third quarter 2024. There were no borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank or other correspondent banks at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company s estimated unpledged collateral qualifying debt securities totaled thousand. 

The Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. When the valuation assumptions used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability are categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the asset or liability is categorized in its entirety within the lowest level of the hierarchy. These levels are: 

Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 includes U.S. Treasury and equity securities, which are traded by dealers or brokers in active markets. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 2 includes mutual funds, federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate securities, commercial paper, collateralized loan obligations, municipal bonds and securities of U.S government entities and U.S. government sponsored entities. 

Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 

The Company relies on independent vendor pricing services to measure fair value for equity securities, debt securities available for sale and debt securities held to maturity. The Company employs three pricing services. To validate the pricing of these vendors, the Company compares vendors pricing for each of the securities for consistency; significant pricing differences, if any, are evaluated using all available independent quotes with the quote most closely reflecting the market generally used as the fair value estimate. In addition, the Company evaluates debt securities for credit losses on a quarterly basis. As with any valuation technique used to estimate fair value, changes in underlying assumptions used could significantly affect the results of current and future values. Accordingly, these fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale of the securities. 

The Company regularly reviews the valuation techniques and assumptions used by its vendors and determines which valuation techniques are utilized based on observable market inputs for the type of securities being measured. The Company uses the information to determine the placement in the fair value hierarchy as level 1, 2 or 3.

Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost or fair-value accounting of individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were recorded in the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the following tables provide the level of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment and the carrying value of the related assets at period end. 

Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis

Level 3 Valuation is based upon present value of expected future cash flows, independent market prices, estimated liquidation values of loan collateral or appraised value of the collateral as determined by third-party independent appraisers, less for selling costs, generally. The unobservable inputs and qualitative information about the unobservable inputs are not presented as the inputs were not developed by the Company. 

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The tables below are a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorized, excluding financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The values assigned do not necessarily represent amounts which ultimately may be realized for assets or paid to settle liabilities. In addition, these values do not give effect to adjustments to fair value which may occur when financial instruments are sold or settled in larger quantities. The carrying amounts in the following tables are recorded in the balance sheet under the indicated captions. 

The Company has not included assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments such as goodwill, long-term relationships with deposit, merchant processing and trust customers, other purchased intangibles, premises and equipment, deferred taxes, and other assets and liabilities. The total estimated fair values do not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company.

The majority of the Company s standby letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit carry current market interest rates if converted to loans. No premium or discount was ascribed to these commitments because virtually all funding would be at current market rates. 

thousand at September 30, 2024 and thousand at December 31, 2023. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Loan commitments are subject to the Company s normal credit policies and collateral requirements. Unfunded loan commitments were thousand at September 30, 2024 and thousand at December 31, 2023. Standby letters of credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support customers short-term financing requirements and must meet the Company s normal credit policies and collateral requirements. Financial and performance standby letters of credit outstanding totaled thousand at September 30, 2024 and thousand at December 31, 2023. Commitments for commercial and similar letters of credit totaled thousand at September 30, 2024 and thousand December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company had thousand in outstanding full recourse guarantees to a third party credit card company at September 30, 2024 and thousand at December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a reserve for unfunded commitments of thousand for the above-mentioned loan commitments of thousand that are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The Company s reserve for unfunded commitments was thousand at December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities. 

Due to the nature of its business, the Company is subject to various threatened or filed legal cases. Based on the advice of legal counsel, the Company does not expect such cases will have a material, adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Legal liabilities are accrued when obligations become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Financial Overview 

Westamerica Bancorporation and subsidiaries (collectively, the Company reported net income of 35.1 million or 1.31 diluted earnings per common share EPS for the third quarter 2024 compared with net income of 41.6 million or 1.56 EPS for the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter 2024 results included a 202 thousand life insurance gain and a 1.4 million gain on sale of other assets equivalent to 0.04 EPS. The Company reported net income of 106.9 million or 4.01 EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported net income of 122.3 million or 4.58 EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, including a 1.2 million reversal of provision for credit losses, net of a 400 thousand provision for credit losses in the third quarter 2023. Third quarter 2023 results also include a 278 thousand life insurance gain. 

The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board FOMC reduced the federal funds rate in September 2024. Inflation has receded toward the FOMC s inflation goal of 2 percent, although inflation has not yet reached 2 percent. The unemployment rate has recently increased but remains low. On September 18, 2024, in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the FOMC decided to reduce the federal funds rate by 0.5 percent to the range of 4.75 to 5 percent. The interest rate paid on reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Bank was 4.90 as of September 30, 2024. The Bank maintains reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Bank; the amount that earns interest is identified as interest-bearing cash . 

Management continues to evaluate the impacts of inflation, the Federal Reserve s monetary policy and climate changes on the Company s business and its customers. The banking industry experienced significant volatility with several regional bank failures in the first half of 2023, creating industrywide concerns related to liquidity, deposit outflows and unrealized losses on debt securities. These events could adversely affect the Company s funding of its operations. The extent of the impact on the Company s results of operations, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as the Company s ability to execute near- and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted. 

The Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent FTE basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. Management believes the FTE basis is valuable to the reader because the Company s loan and investment securities portfolios contain municipal loans and securities that are federally tax exempt. The Company s tax exempt loans and securities composition may not be similar to that of other banks, therefore in order to reflect the impact of the federally tax exempt loans and securities on the net interest margin and net interest income for comparability with other banks, the Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on an FTE basis. 

The Company s significant accounting policies (see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to Financial Statements in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K and Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q) are fundamental to understanding the Company s results of operations and financial condition. The Company adopted the following new accounting guidance: 

FASB ASU 2020-04 , Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , was issued March 2020. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to loan and lease agreements, derivative contracts, and other transactions affected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR toward new interest rate benchmarks. For transactions that are modified because of reference rate reform and that meet certain scope guidance (i) modifications of loan agreements should be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate and the modification will be considered "minor" so that any existing unamortized origination fees/costs would carry forward and continue to be amortized and (ii) modifications of lease agreements should be accounted for as a continuation of the existing agreement with no reassessments of the lease classification and the discount rate or remeasurements of lease payments that otherwise would be required for modifications not accounted for as separate contracts. ASU 2020-04 also provides numerous optional expedients for derivative accounting. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The ASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 to December 2024. As of March 31, 2024, all contracts and transactions within the scope of ASU 2020-04 have transitioned to alternative reference rates. The accounting effects of the transition to alternative reference rates were applied prospectively as an adjustment to the effective interest rate and did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

FASB ASU 2022-03 , Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , was issued June 2022. The ASU clarifies the guidance in Topic 820 when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security. Additionally, the ASU requires specific disclosures related to equity securities that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. The required disclosures include (1) the fair value of such equity securities reflected in the balance sheet, (2) the nature and remaining duration of the corresponding restrictions, and (3) any circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions. The ASU became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Net income for the third quarter 2024 decreased 6.5 million compared with the third quarter 2023 primarily due to decreased net interest and loan fee income (FTE), partially offset by lower tax provision (FTE). Net interest and loan fee income (FTE) decreased 9.6 million in the third quarter 2024 compared with the third quarter 2023 due to lower average balances of investment debt securities and loans, higher average balances of Bank Term Funding Program borrowings and higher rate on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher yield on loans and higher average balances of interest-bearing cash. The Company recorded no provision for credit losses based on the results of its current expected credit losses CECL model and Management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of its loans. The Company provided a 400 thousand provision for credit losses in the third quarter 2023, based on the results of its CECL model and Management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of its loans and debt securities held to maturity. Third quarter 2024 noninterest income increased compared with the third quarter 2023 primarily due to a 1.4 million gain on sale of other assets, partially offset by lower income from merchant processing services. Third quarter 2024 noninterest expense increased compared with the third quarter 2023 primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense related to annual merit increases and higher group health insurance costs for employees, partially offset by lower operating losses from limited partnership investments. The tax rate (FTE) was 27.1 for the third quarter 2024 and 27.4 for the third quarter 2023. 

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15.4 million compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreased net interest and loan fee income (FTE), partially offset by lower tax provision (FTE). Net interest and loan fee income (FTE) decreased 19.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower average balances of investment debt securities and loans, higher average balances of Bank Term Funding Program borrowings and higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher yield on interest-earning assets and higher average balances of interest-bearing cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company provided 300 thousand for credit losses, which was recorded in the first quarter, based on the results of the CECL model and Management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of its loans. The Company recorded a 1.2 million reversal of provision for credit losses, net of a 400 thousand provision in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of a 2.2 million recovery on a previously charged off loan in the first quarter 2023. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained at the same level compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 1.4 million gain on sale of other assets, offset by lower income from merchant processing services and ATM processing fees. Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense related to annual merit increases and higher group health insurance costs for employees, partially offset by decreases in losses from unauthorized debit card use, legal fees, operating losses from limited partnership investments and FDIC insurance assessments. The tax rate (FTE) was 26.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 27.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company s yield on earning assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily affected by collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), held in debt securities available for sale portfolio. The Company s yield on earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared with the same period in 2023 primarily affected by CLOs and interest-bearing cash. The CLOs have interest coupons that change once every three months by the amount of change in the three-month SOFR base rate. The average balances and yields of CLOs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,166 million yielding 7.20 and 1,324 million yielding 7.22 , respectively. The average balances and yields of CLOs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 1,531 million yielding 7.16 and 1,554 million yielding 6.77 , respectively. The interest-bearing cash yield changes by the amount of change in the overnight federal funds rate on the effective date declared by the FOMC. The average balances and yields of interest-bearing cash for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 495 million yielding 5.35 and 342 million yielding 5.37 , respectively. The average balance and yields of interest-bearing cash for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 287 million yielding 5.35 and 208 million yielding 5.06 , respectively. The Company has other earning assets with variable yields such as commercial loans and lines of credit, consumer lines of credit and adjustable rate residential real estate loans, which are included in other taxable loans in the following Summary of Average Balances, Yields/Rates and Interest Differential. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to competitive financial product pricing and higher volume on Bank Term Funding Program borrowings.

Summary of Average Balances, Yields/Rates and Interest Differential 

The following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders equity, the amounts of interest income earned from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields, and the amounts of interest expense incurred on average interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting rates. Average loan balances include nonperforming loans. Interest income includes the reversal of previously accrued interest on loans placed on nonaccrual status during the period, proceeds from loans on nonaccrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income, and accretion of purchased loan discounts. Yields, rates and interest margins are annualized. Yields on tax-exempt securities and loans have been adjusted upward to reflect the effect of income exempt from federal income taxation at the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent.

The Company manages credit risk by enforcing conservative underwriting and administration procedures and aggressively pursuing collection efforts with debtors experiencing financial difficulties. The provision for credit losses reflects Management's assessment of credit risk in the loan portfolio and debt securities held to maturity portfolio during each of the periods presented. 

The Company provided no provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 based on Management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of its loans and debt securities held to maturity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company provided 300 thousand for credit losses, which was recorded in the first quarter, based on the results of the CECL model and Management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of its loans and debt securities held to maturity. The Company provided a 400 thousand provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2023, based on the results of the CECL model and Management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of its loans and debt securities held to maturity. The Company recorded a 1.2 million reversal of provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which reflected a 2.2 million recovery on a previously charged off loan in the first quarter 2023.

Management continually evaluates the Company s investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, liquidity, and the level of interest rate risk to which the Company is exposed. These evaluations may cause Management to change the level of funds the Company deploys into investment securities and change the composition of the Company s investment securities portfolio. 

At September 30, 2024, substantially all of the Company s investment securities were investment grade as rated by one or more major rating agencies. In addition to monitoring credit rating agency evaluations, Management performs its own evaluations regarding the credit worthiness of the issuer or the securitized assets underlying asset-backed securities. The Company s procedures for evaluating investments in securities are in accordance with guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Investing in Securities without Reliance on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Agencies (SR 12-15) and other regulatory guidance.

Loan Portfolio Credit Risk 

The Company extends loans to commercial and consumer customers which expose the Company to the risk that the borrowers will default, causing loss. The Company s lending activities are exposed to various qualitative risks. All loan segments are exposed to risks inherent in the economy and market conditions. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial loan segment include the borrowers business performance and financial condition, and the value of collateral for secured loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial real estate segment include the borrowers business performance and the value of properties collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the construction loan segment include the borrowers performance in successfully developing the real estate into the intended purpose and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the residential real estate segment include the borrowers financial wherewithal to service the mortgages and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the consumer loan segment include the financial condition of the borrowers and the value of collateral securing the loans. 

The preparation of the financial statements requires Management to estimate the amount of expected losses in the loan portfolio and establish an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is maintained by assessing or reversing a provision for credit losses through the Company s earnings. In estimating credit losses, Management must exercise judgment in evaluating information deemed relevant, such as financial information regarding individual borrowers, overall loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other information. The amount of ultimate losses on the loan portfolio can vary from the estimated amounts. Management follows a systematic methodology to estimate loss potential in an effort to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses. 

The Company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and follows a strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk. The Bank s organizational structure separates the functions of business development and loan underwriting; Management believes this segregation of duties avoids inherent conflicts of combining business development and loan approval functions. In measuring and managing credit risk, the Company adheres to the following practices: 

The Bank maintains a Loan Review Department which reports directly to the audit committee of the Board of Directors. The Loan Review Department performs independent evaluations of loans to challenge the credit risk grades assigned by Management, using grading standards employed by bank regulatory agencies. Those loans judged to carry higher risk attributes are referred to as classified loans. Classified loans receive elevated Management attention in order to maximize collection. 

The Bank maintains two loan administration offices whose sole responsibility is to manage and collect classified loans. 

Classified loans with higher levels of credit risk are further designated as nonaccrual loans. Management places classified loans on nonaccrual status when full collection of contractual interest and principal payments is in doubt. Uncollected interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is reversed as a charge against interest income. The Company does not accrue interest income on loans following placement on nonaccrual status. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the loan unless the carrying amount is well secured by loan collateral. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing, and repossessed loan collateral (commonly referred to as Other Real Estate Owned ).

At September 30, 2024, nonaccrual loans consisted of two loans. 

Management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio is reasonably stable; however, classified and nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period. The performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment, economic conditions, pandemics, and collateral values or factors particular to the borrower. No assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual and delinquent loans will not occur in the future.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Debt Securities Held to Maturity 

Management segmented debt securities held to maturity, selected methods to estimate losses for each segment, and measured a loss estimate. Agency mortgage-backed securities were assigned no credit loss allowance due to the perceived backing of government sponsored entities. Corporate securities held to maturity were individually evaluated for expected credit loss by evaluating the issuer s financial condition, profitability, cash flows, and credit ratings. The Company has evaluated each issuer s historical financial performance and ability to service debt payments, including throughout and following the 2008-2009 recession. The Company has an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis continues to be zero. At September 30, 2024, no credit loss allowance was assigned to corporate securities held to maturity based on evaluation of each individual issuer s historical financial performance throughout full business cycles. Municipal securities were evaluated for risk of default based on credit rating and remaining term to maturity using Moody s risk of default factors; Moody s loss upon default factors were applied to the assumed defaulted principal amounts to estimate the amount for credit loss allowance. Allowance for credit losses related to debt securities held to maturity was 1 thousand related to municipal securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, reflecting the expected credit losses on debt securities held to maturity. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 

The Company s allowance for credit losses on loans represents Management s estimate of forecasted credit losses in the loan portfolio based on the current expected credit loss model. In evaluating credit risk for loans, Management measures the loss potential of the carrying value of loans. As described above, payments received on nonaccrual loans may be applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected. 

-46-

The preparation of the financial statements requires Management to estimate the amount of expected losses over the expected contractual life of the Bank s existing loan portfolio and establish an allowance for credit losses. Loan agreements generally include a maturity date, and the Company considers the contractual life of a loan agreement to extend from the date of origination to the contractual maturity date. In estimating credit losses, Management must exercise significant judgment in evaluating information deemed relevant. The amount of ultimate losses on the loan portfolio can vary from the estimated amounts. Management follows a systematic methodology to estimate loss potential in an effort to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses. 

The allowance for credit losses is established through provisions for credit losses charged to income. Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for credit losses when all or a portion of the recorded amount of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized. The Company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for expected losses based on historical loss rates adjusted for current and expected conditions over a forecast period. These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall credit loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions, or credit protection agreements and other factors. 

Loans that share common risk characteristics are segregated into pools based on common characteristics, which is primarily determined by loan, borrower, or collateral type. Historical loss rates are determined for each pool. For consumer installment loans, primarily secured by automobiles, historical loss rates are determined using a vintage methodology, which tracks losses based on period of origination. For commercial, construction, and commercial real estate, historical loss rates are determined using an open pool methodology where losses are tracked over time for all loans included in the pool at the historical measurement date. Historical loss rates are adjusted for factors that are not reflected in the historical loss rates that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have not yet been recognized in past loan charge-off history, estimated losses based on management s reasonable and supportable expectation of economic trends over a forecast horizon of up to two years, and other factors that impact credit loss expectations that are not reflected in the historical loss rates. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the effectiveness of the Company s loan review system, adequacy of lending Management and staff, loan policies and procedures, problem loan trends, and concentrations of credit. At the end of the two-year forecast period loss rates revert immediately to the historical loss rates. The results of this analysis are applied to the amortized cost of the loans included within each pool. 

Loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans in the pools are evaluated individually. A loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. A credit loss reserve for collateral-dependent loans is established at the difference between the amortized cost basis in the loan and the fair value of the underlying collateral adjusted for costs to sell. For other individually evaluated loans that are not collateral dependent, a credit loss reserve is established at the difference between the amortized cost basis in the loan and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate. The impact of an expected modification to be made to loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is included in the allowance for credit losses when management determines such modification is likely. 

Accrued interest is recorded in other assets and is excluded from the estimation of expected credit loss. Accrued interest is reversed through interest income when amounts are determined to be uncollectible, which generally occurs when the underlying receivable is placed on nonaccrual status or charged off.

The Company's allowance for credit losses on loans is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for expected losses based on historical loss rates adjusted for current and expected conditions over a forecast period. These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall loan loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing and forecasted economic conditions, or credit protection agreements and other factors. Loans that share common risk characteristics are segregated into pools based on common characteristics, which are primarily determined by loan, borrower, or collateral type. Historical loss rates are determined for each pool. Loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans in the pools are evaluated individually. See Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information related to accounting policies.

Management considers the 15.3 million allowance for credit losses on loans to be adequate as a reserve against current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 

See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the loan portfolio, loan portfolio credit risk, allowance for credit losses on loans, and other real estate owned. 

Climate-Related Financial Risk 

Climate change presents risk to the Company, our critical vendors and our customers. Our risk management practices incorporate the challenges brought about by climate change. The operations conducted in our centralized facilities and branch locations can be disrupted by acute physical risks such as flooding and windstorms, and by chronic physical risks such as rising sea levels, sustained higher temperatures, drought, and increased wildfires. Over the intermediate and longer-term, the Company can be subject to transition risks such as market demand, and policy and law changes. 

None of the Company s physical locations are located near sea level, and only a limited number of branches are located in flood zones. The Company and its critical vendors maintain property and casualty insurance, and maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans, which include redundant operational locations and power sources. The Company s operations do not use a significant amount of water in producing its products and services. 

-49-

The Company monitors the climate risks of its loan customers. Borrowers with real estate loan collateral located in flood zones must carry flood insurance under the loans terms. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 6 million in loans to agricultural borrowers; Management continuously monitors these customers access to adequate water sources as well as their ability to sustain low crop yields and volatile commodity prices without encountering financial hardship. The Company makes automobile loans; changes in consumer demand, or governmental laws or policies, regarding gasoline, electric and hybrid vehicles are not considered to be material risks to the Company s automobile lending practices. The Company considers climate risk in its underwriting of corporate bonds, and avoids purchasing bonds of issuers, which, in Management s judgement, have elevated climate risk. 

While the Company follows risk management practices related to climate risk, the Company may experience financial losses due to climate risk despite these precautions. 

Asset/Liability and Market Risk Management 

Asset/liability management involves the evaluation, monitoring and management of interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. The fundamental objective of the Company's management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk is a significant market risk affecting the Company. Many factors affect the Company s exposure to interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Financial instruments may mature or re-price at different times. Financial instruments may re-price at the same time but by different amounts. Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. The timing and amount of cash flows of various financial instruments may change as interest rates change. In addition, the changing levels of interest rates may have an impact on bond portfolio volumes, accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, loan demand and demand for various deposit products. 

The Company s earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies, particularly the FOMC. The monetary policies of the FOMC can influence the overall demand for loans and growth of deposits and the level of interest rates earned on loans and investment securities and paid for deposits and other borrowings. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable. 

Management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin and net interest income. At times, depending on expected increases or decreases in market interest rates, the relationship between long and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, Management may adjust the Company's interest rate risk position. The Company's results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long, intermediate, and short-term interest rates. 

Management monitors the Company s interest rate risk using a simulation model, which is periodically assessed using supervisory guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SR 11-7 Guidance on Model Risk Management. Management measures exposure to interest rate risk using a dynamic composition simulation and static composition simulation. Within the dynamic composition simulation, interest rate changes are assumed to occur over time and Management makes assumptions regarding the expected change in the volume of financial instruments given the assumed change in market interest rates. Within the static composition simulation, interest rate changes are assumed to occur immediately and cash flows are assumed redeployed into like financial instruments at prevailing rates and yields. Both simulations are used to measure expected changes in net interest income assuming various levels of change in market interest rates. 

The Company s asset and liability position was generally asset sensitive at September 30, 2024, based on the interest rate assumptions applied to the simulation model. An asset sensitive position results in a larger change in interest income than in interest expense resulting from application of assumed interest rate changes. However, in the dynamic simulation, an assumed decline in interest rates is expected to result in improved deposit balances funding higher earning asset levels. Further, in the dynamic simulation, no change in interest rates is expected to result in a decline in net interest income as asset yields remain stable and deposit costs rise as the Bank negotiates deposit rates with customers in the current environment. 

-50-

At September 30, 2024, Management s most recent measurements of estimated changes in net interest income were: 

Dynamic simulation (balance sheet composition changes): 

Assumed change in interest rates over 1 year 
			 -2.0 
			 -1.0 
			 0.0 
			 +1.0 
			 +2.0 

First year change in net interest income 
			 -3.1 
			 -0.8 
			 -0.8 
			 +2.1 
			 +3.7 

Static simulation (balance sheet composition unchanged): 

Assumed immediate change in interest rates 
			 -2.0 
			 -1.0 
			 0.0 
			 +1.0 
			 +2.0 

First year change in net interest income 
			 -10.4 
			 -5.0 
			 +2.6 
			 +5.2 
			 +10.0 

Simulation estimates depend on, and will change with, the size and mix of the actual and projected composition of financial instruments at the time of each simulation. Assumptions made in the simulation may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. In addition, the simulation does not take into account any future actions Management may undertake to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, loan prepayment estimates and spread relationships, which may change regularly. 

The Company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the Company's Board of Directors. 

Market Risk - Equity Markets 

Equity price risk can affect the Company. Preferred or common stock holdings, as permitted by banking regulations, can fluctuate in value. Changes in value of preferred or common stock holdings are recognized in the Company's income statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Fluctuations in the Company's common stock price can impact the Company's financial results in several ways. First, the Company has at times repurchased and retired its common stock; the market price paid to retire the Company's common stock affects the level of the Company's shareholders' equity, cash flows and shares outstanding. Second, the Company's common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share. Third, fluctuations in the Company's common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase Company common stock through the exercise of such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding and potentially adding volatility to the book tax provision. Finally, the amount of compensation expense and tax deductions associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the Company's common stock price. 

Market Risk - Other 

Market values of loan collateral can directly impact the level of loan chargeoffs and the provision for credit losses. The financial condition and liquidity of debtors issuing bonds and debtors whose mortgages or other obligations are securitized can directly impact the credit quality of the Company s investment securities portfolio requiring the Company to establish or increase reserves for expected credit losses. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk, are not significant in the normal course of the Company's business activities. 

Liquidity and Funding 

The objective of liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund the Bank's operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The Bank achieves this objective through the selection of asset and liability maturity mixes that it believes best meet its needs. The Bank's liquidity position is enhanced by its ability to raise additional funds as needed by borrowing from correspondent banks or in the wholesale markets, or by selling debt securities available for sale. 

In recent years, the Bank's deposit base has provided the majority of the Bank's funding requirements. This low-cost source of funds, along with shareholders' equity, provided 95 of funding for average total assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 97 for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank s funding from customer deposits is in part reliant on the confidence clients have in the Bank. The Bank places a very high priority in maintaining this confidence through conservative credit risk and capital management practices and by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. 

Total deposits were 5,065 million at September 30, 2024 and 5,474 million at December 31, 2023. Total time deposits were 86 million at September 30, 2024 and 97 million at December 31, 2023. The Company has no foreign time deposits. The standard FDIC deposit insurance amount is 250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category. At September 30, 2024, estimated federally uninsured total deposits and time deposits were 2,482 million and 5 million, respectively.

Banking industry deposits, including for Westamerica Bank, grew rapidly in 2020 and 2021 due to the injection of fiscal stimulus into the United States economy, including Paycheck Protection Program loans, and an easing of Federal Reserve monetary policy, both in response to the COVID pandemic. Federal Reserve monetary policy easing included reduction in the federal funds rate to a range of 0.00 to 0.25 and net purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, which increase the money supply and aggregate bank deposits. Subsequently, inflation rose considerably while employment conditions remained strong. In 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve s monetary policy reversed to tightening, in an effort to reduce inflation. The monetary policy tightening included increasing and keeping the federal funds rate to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 and net reductions of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, which reduce the money supply and aggregate bank deposits. Westamerica Bank s deposit totals are subject to both the fiscal policies of the United States government and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve; the decline in Westamerica Bank deposits during 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was influenced by these fiscal and monetary policies. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service IRS declared every county in which Westamerica Bank operates as Natural Disaster Areas due to 2022-2023 winter storms; the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board extended the 2022 tax filing deadline and 2023 tax installment payment due dates to November 16, 2023. Management believes this deferment of tax payment deadlines impacted deposit totals in the fourth quarter 2023 as customers paid their federal and California tax obligations. Total deposits declined 409,217 thousand from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to competitive financial product pricing.

Liquidity is further provided by assets such as balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank, and principal and interest payments from debt securities and loans. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 502,945 thousand in cash balances. During the twelve months ending September 30, 2025, the Company expects to receive 321,000 thousand in principal payments from its debt securities. If additional operational liquidity is required, the Company can pledge debt securities as collateral for borrowing purposes; at September 30, 2024, the Company s debt securities which qualify as collateral for borrowing totaled 3,696,256 thousand. In the ordinary course of business, the Company pledges debt securities as collateral for certain depository customers; at September 30, 2024, the Company had pledged 764,404 thousand in debt securities for depository customers. In the ordinary course of business, the Company pledges debt securities as collateral for borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank; at September 30, 2024, the Company had pledged 815,919 thousand in debt securities at the Federal Reserve Bank. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s average borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and other correspondent banks were 143,412 thousand and -0- thousand, respectively, and at September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank or other correspondent banks. At September 30, 2024, the Company had access to borrowing from the Federal Reserve up to 815,919 thousand based on collateral pledged at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company s estimated unpledged collateral qualifying debt securities totaled 1,663,673 thousand. Debt securities eligible as collateral are shown at market value unless noted otherwise:

Liquidity risk can result from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows, or from disruptions in the financial markets. The Bank performs liquidity stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its liquidity. Under the stress testing, the Bank assumes outflows of funds increase beyond expected levels. Measurement of such heightened outflows considers the composition of the Bank s deposit base, including any concentration of deposits, non-deposit funding such as short-term borrowings, and unfunded lending commitments. The composition of the Bank s deposits is considered including the broad industry and geographic diversification in the Bank s market area. The Bank evaluates its stock of highly liquid assets to meet the assumed higher levels of outflows. Highly liquid assets include cash and amounts due from other banks from daily transaction settlements, reduced by branch cash needs and any Federal Reserve Bank reserve requirements, and investment securities based on regulatory guidelines. Based on the results of the most recent liquidity stress test, Management is satisfied with the liquidity condition of the Bank. However, no assurance can be given the Bank will not experience a period of reduced liquidity. 

Management continually monitors the Bank s cash levels. Loan demand from credit worthy borrowers will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions. The Bank aggressively solicits non-interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposits, which are the least sensitive to changes in interest rates. The growth of these deposit balances is subject to heightened competition, the success of the Bank's sales efforts, delivery of superior customer service, new regulations and market conditions. The Bank does not aggressively solicit higher-costing time deposits. Changes in interest rates, most notably rising or elevated interest rates, or increased consumer spending, could impact deposit volumes. Depending on economic conditions, interest rate levels, liquidity management and a variety of other conditions, any deposit growth may be used to fund loans or purchase investment securities. However, due to possible volatility in economic conditions, competition and political uncertainty, loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain. Shareholder dividends are expected to continue subject to the Board's discretion and continuing evaluation of capital levels, earnings, asset quality and other factors. 

Westamerica Bancorporation ("Parent Company") is a separate entity apart from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Parent Company is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its shareholders, and interest and principal on any outstanding debt. The Parent Company had no debt as of September 30, 2024. Substantially all of the Parent Company's revenues are obtained from subsidiary dividends and service fees. 

The Bank s dividends paid to the Parent Company, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and Parent Company cash balances provided adequate cash for the Parent Company to pay shareholder dividends of 35 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 46 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 and retire common stock in the amounts of 210 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 14 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. Payment of dividends to the Parent Company by the Bank is limited under California and Federal laws. The Company believes these regulatory dividend restrictions will not impact Parent Company's ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations. The Parent Company s cash balance was 231 million at September 30, 2024 and 155 million at December 31, 2023. 

Capital Resources 

The Company has historically generated high levels of earnings, which provide a means of accumulating capital. The Company's net income as a percentage of average shareholders' equity return on equity or ROE was annualized 14.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 18.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company also raises capital as employees exercise stock options. Capital raised through the exercise of stock options was 298 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 950 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2023. 

-53-

The Company paid common dividends totaling 35 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 46 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which represent dividends per common share of 1.32 and 1.72, respectively. The Company's earnings have historically exceeded dividends paid to shareholders. The amount of earnings in excess of dividends provides the Company resources to finance growth and maintain appropriate levels of shareholders' equity. In the absence of profitable growth opportunities, the Company has at times repurchased and retired its common stock as another means to return capital to shareholders. The Company repurchased and retired s4 thousand shares valued at 210 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 274 thousand shares valued at 14 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. 

The Company's primary capital resource is shareholders' equity, which was 909 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 773 million at December 31, 2023. The Company's ratio of equity to total assets was 14.75 at September 30, 2024 and 12.14 at December 31, 2023. 

The Company performs capital stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its capital. Under the stress testing, the Company assumes various scenarios such as deteriorating economic and operating conditions, and unanticipated asset devaluations. The Company measures the impact of these scenarios on its earnings and capital. Based on the results of the most recent stress tests, Management is satisfied with the capital condition of the Bank and the Company. However, no assurance can be given the Bank or Company will not experience a period of reduced earnings or a reduction in capital from unanticipated events and circumstances.

The Company and the Bank routinely project capital levels by analyzing forecasted earnings, credit quality, shareholder dividends, asset volumes, share repurchase activity, stock option exercise proceeds, and other factors. Based on current capital projections, the Bank expects to maintain regulatory capital levels in excess of the minimum required to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework. The Company expects to continue paying quarterly dividends to shareholders. No assurance can be given that changes in capital management plans will not occur.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk, even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the Company s Board of Directors. 

Credit risk and interest rate risk are the most significant market risks affecting the Company, and equity price risk can also affect the Company s financial results. These risks are described in the preceding sections regarding Loan Portfolio Credit Risk, and Asset/Liability and Market Risk Management. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk, are not significant in the normal course of the Company s business activities. 

Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does business. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. 

Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and that such information is communicated to the Company s management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The evaluation did not identify any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Due to the nature of its business, the Company is subject to various threatened or filed legal cases. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any material pending legal proceeding, nor is their property the subject of any material pending legal proceeding, other than ordinary routine legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Company s business. Based on the advice of legal counsel, the Company does not expect such cases will have a material, adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. Legal liabilities are accrued when obligations become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes detailed disclosure about the risks faced by the Company s business.

 (b) None 

 (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The Company s most recent repurchase plan was approved on July 28, 2022 and expired on September 1, 2023. There is no stock repurchase plan in place currently.
