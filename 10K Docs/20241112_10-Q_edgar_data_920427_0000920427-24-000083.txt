 million. Most of the Company s AFS debt securities were classified as Level 2 assets at September 30, 2024. The valuation of AFS debt securities using Level 2 inputs was primarily determined using the market approach, which uses quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and all other relevant information. It includes third-party model pricing, defined as valuing securities based upon their relationship with other benchmark securities. Included in the Company s AFS debt securities are select corporate bonds which are classified as Level 3 assets at September 30, 2024. The valuation of these corporate bonds is determined using broker quotes or third-party vendor prices that are not adjusted by management. Market inputs used in the other valuation techniques or underlying third-party vendor prices or broker quotes include benchmark and government bond yield curves, credit spreads and trade execution data. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Level 3 AFS debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Activity Unrealized holding gains (losses) included in other comprehensive income ) Prinicpal Payments ) Unrealized holding losses included in net income ) Balance of recurring Level 3 assets at September 30 Equity Securities with Readily Determinable Fair Values As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Company s equity securities portfolio was million. All of the Company s equity securities were classified as Level 1 assets at September 30, 2024. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company s derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 assets, as the readily observable market inputs to these models are validated to external sources, such as industry pricing services, or are corroborated through recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market-related data. There were no material changes in the inputs or methodologies used to determine fair value during the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the periods ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023.

Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Quoted Prices Significant in Active Other Significant Assets Markets for Observable Unobservable Measured at Fair Identical Assets Inputs Inputs (In thousands) Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Measured on a non-recurring basis: Financial assets: Collateral-dependent loans Certain assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: Collateral-Dependent Loans Fair value is determined based on the fair value of the collateral and is measured for impairment based upon a third-party appraisal. When an updated appraisal is received for a nonperforming loan, the value on the appraisal may be discounted. If there is a deficiency in the value after the Company applies these discounts, management applies a specific reserve and the loan remains in nonaccrual status. The receipt of an updated appraisal would not qualify as a reason to put a loan back into accruing status. The Company removes loans from nonaccrual status generally when the borrower makes six months of contractual payments and/or demonstrates the ability to service the debt going forward. Charge-offs are determined based upon the loss that management believes the Company will incur after evaluating collateral for impairment based upon the valuation methods described above and the ability of the borrower to pay any deficiency. The allowance for individually evaluated loans is included in the allowance for credit losses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for individually evaluated loans was million, compared to million at December 31, 2023.

December 31, 2023 Carrying (In thousands) amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: Debt securities held to maturity SBA loans held for sale Loans, net of allowance for credit losses Financial liabilities: Deposits Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the effect of fair value estimates have not been considered in the above estimates.

 million provision for credit loss on AFS debt securities compared to provision for credit loss on AFS debt securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The company owns million in par of this position and moved the position into non-accrual status during the three months ending June 30, 2024. The contractual maturities of available for sale and held for maturity debt securities at September 30, 2024 are set forth in the following table. Maturities may differ from contractual maturities in residential mortgage-backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be prepaid without any penalties. Therefore, residential mortgage-backed securities are not included in the maturity categories in the following summary.

 SBA PPP loans Commercial loans SBA 504 loans Commercial industrial Commercial real estate Commercial real estate construction Residential mortgage loans Consumer loans Home equity Consumer other Residential construction loans Total loans held for investment SBA loans held for sale Total loans Loans are made to individuals and commercial entities. Specific loan terms vary as to interest rate, repayment and collateral requirements based on the type of loan requested and the credit worthiness of the prospective borrower. Credit risk tends to be geographically concentrated in that a majority of the loan customers are located in the markets serviced by the Bank, most notably in New Jersey. Additionally, the New Jersey credit concentration is primarily focused within the counties that the Company operates in. Loan performance may be adversely affected by factors impacting the general economy or conditions specific to the real estate market such as geographic location and/or property type. A description of the Company s different loan segments follows: SBA Loans: SBA 7(a) loans, on which the SBA has historically provided guarantees of up to percent of the principal balance, are considered a higher risk loan product for the Company than its other loan products. The guaranteed portion of the Company s SBA loans is generally sold in the secondary market with the nonguaranteed portion held in the portfolio as a loan held for investment. SBA loans are for the purpose of providing working capital, business acquisitions, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes. Loans are guaranteed by the businesses major owners. SBA loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided. Loans held for sale represent the guaranteed portion of SBA loans and are reflected at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. When sales of SBA loans do occur, the premium received on the sale and the present value of future cash flows of the servicing assets are recognized in income. All criteria for sale accounting must be met in order for the loan sales to occur. Servicing assets represent the estimated fair value of retained servicing rights, net of servicing costs, at the time loans are sold. Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Impairment is evaluated based on stratifying the underlying financial assets by date of origination and term. Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions. Serviced loans sold to others are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income and fees collected for loan servicing are credited to noninterest income when earned, net of amortization on the related servicing assets.

Net Interest Income The primary source of the Company s operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on interest-earning assets and fees earned on loans and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans to individuals and businesses, investment securities and interest-earning deposits. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing demand, savings, brokered and time deposits, FHLB advances and other borrowings. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, tax-equivalent net interest income amounted to 24.9 million, an increase of 1.3 million or 5.6 percent when compared to the same period in 2023. The net interest margin increased 20 basis points to 4.16 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.96 percent for the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, tax-equivalent interest income was 39.6 million, an increase of 2.6 million or 6.9 percent when compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was mainly driven by the increases in the yield on loans and the balance of average interest-bearing deposits and securities, partially offset by a decrease in the yield on securities, a decrease in the average volume of loans and the average balance and yield of FHLB stock. Of the 2.6 million net increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, 2.6 million is due to an increase in yields on earning assets, partially offset by 53 thousand due to a decrease in average earning assets. The average volume of interest-earning assets increased 16.7 million to 2.4 billion for the third quarter of 2024. This was due primarily to a 15.6 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits, a 6.4 million increase in average investment securities and a 2.6 million increase in average loans and, partially offset by a 7.9 million decrease in average FHLB stock.

Total interest expense was 14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.2 million or 9.2 percent compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by the increased rates and volume of time deposits, savings deposits and demand deposits and increased rates on brokered deposits, partially offset by a decline in the volume of brokered deposits and decreased rates and volume of borrowed funds and subordinated debentures. Of the 1.2 million increase in interest expense, 1.3 million was due to increased rate on average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in volume and a shift in the mix of liability categories.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, tax-equivalent interest income was 115.5 million, an increase of 9.7 million or 9.2 percent when compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was mainly driven by the increase in the rates on loans, securities, FHLB stock and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of FHLB stock. Of the 9.7 million net increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, 9.5 million is due to an increase in yields on the earning assets and 0.2 million is due to an increase to average earning assets. The average volume of interest-earning assets increased 19.0 million to 2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 billion for the same period in 2023.

 Total interest expense was 43.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.6 million or 24.7 percent compared to the same period in 2023. This increase reflects increased volume and rates on interest-bearing demand deposits and time deposits and the rates of savings and brokered deposits, offset by decreased volume and rates on borrowed funds and subordinated debentures compared to a year ago. Of the 8.6 million increase in interest expense, 9.1 million was due to the increased rates on average interest bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in the volume on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-bearing liabilities averaged 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 18.8 million or 1.1 percent compared to the prior year s period.

The provision for credit losses for AFS debt security impairment was none and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to none for the prior year s periods. The impairment was entirely attributable to one senior corporate debt security in the AFS portfolio. The Company owns 5 million in par value of this position and moved the position into non-accrual status during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Each period s credit loss provision is the result of management s analysis of the loan portfolio and reflects changes in the size and composition of the portfolio, the level of net charge-offs, delinquencies, current and expected economic conditions and other internal and external factors impacting the risk within the loan portfolio.

Noninterest Expense and Other Matters Subsequent to quarter end, on November 5, 2024, a contractor (or a subcontractor thereof) working for the Bank damaged certain off-premises utility equipment, causing a power outage that effected the Bank and a number of adjacent businesses. Power was restored to the adjacent businesses within a few hours. The Bank is unaware of the amount of losses, if any, which any effected business may have incurred. No claims have been filed against the Bank, nor against the contractor, to the Bank s knowledge. Nonetheless, the Bank is in possession of the contractor s Certificate of Liability Insurance, however the scope of coverage has not yet been determined, and it is unclear whether the contractor will have the financial wherewithal to satisfy any claims arising from this matter. The Bank is continuing to investigate this matter. Income Tax Expense For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported income tax expense of 3.7 million for an effective tax rate of 25.1 percent, compared to income tax expense of 3.1 million and an effective tax rate of 23.7 percent for the prior year s quarter . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported income tax expense of 10.0 million for an effective tax rate of 25.0 percent, compared to an income tax expense of 10.0 million and an effective tax rate of 25.1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 Total assets increased 56.8 million or 2.2 percent, to 2.6 billion at September 30, 2024, when compared to year end 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases of 45.3 million in gross loans, 8.0 million in securities and 7.8 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and 2.0 million in deferred tax assets, partially offset by a decrease of 3.9 million in FHLB stock. Total shareholders equity increased 22.8 million, when compared to year end 2023, primarily due to earnings and an increase in common stock, partially offset by the repurchase of shares and dividends paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These fluctuations are discussed in further detail in the paragraphs that follow.

 Securities Portfolio The Company s securities portfolio consists of AFS debt securities, HTM debt securities and equity investments. Management determines the appropriate security classification of AFS and HTM at the time of purchase. The investment securities portfolio is maintained for asset-liability management purposes, as well as for liquidity and earnings purposes. AFS debt securities are investments carried at fair value that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for other business purposes. Activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns and as an additional source of earnings. AFS debt securities consist primarily of obligations of U.S. Government, state and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities and corporate and other securities. AFS debt securities totaled 97.7 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.9 million or 6.4 percent, compared to 91.8 million at December 31, 2023. This net increase was the result of: 10.5 million in purchases, 1.2 million in appreciation in the market value of the portfolio. At September 30, 2024, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of 3.3 million compared to a net unrealized loss of 4.5 million at December 31, 2023. These net unrealized losses are reflected net of tax in shareholder s equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss, Which were partially offset by 5.1 million in principal payments and maturities, 0.6 million provision for credit loss on AFS debt securities and 0.1 million in premium amortization. The weighted average life of AFS debt securities, adjusted for prepayments, amounted to 5.0 years and 5.6 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The effective duration of AFS debt securities amounted to 1.4 and 1.7 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. HTM debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost, are investments for which there is the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. The portfolio is primarily comprised of obligations of U.S. Government, state and political subdivisions and mortgage-backed securities. HTM debt securities were 36.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 million or 0.3 percent, compared to 36.1 million at December 31, 2023. The weighted average life of HTM securities, adjusted for prepayments, amounted to 16.1 years and 17.1 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of HTM securities was 30.5 million and 29.7 million, respectively. The effective duration of HTM securities amounted to 10.1 years and 10.9 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Equity securities are investments carried at fair value that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for other business purposes. Activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns and as an additional source of earnings. Equity securities consist of Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") mutual fund investments and the equity holdings of other financial institutions. Equity securities totaled 9.8 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.0 million or 26.1 percent, compared to 7.8 million at December 31, 2023. Securities with a carrying value of 11.8 million and 9.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were held at the FHLB or FRB and were pledged for borrowing purposes; however, all securities were unencumbered by borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Approximately 61 percent of the total debt security investment portfolio had a fixed rate of interest at September 30, 2024.

 See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Securities. Loan Portfolio The loan portfolio, which represents the Company s largest asset group, is a significant source of both interest and fee income. The portfolio consists of SBA, commercial, residential mortgage, consumer and residential construction loans. Each of these segments is subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk. Total loans increased 45.3 million or 2.1 percent to 2.2 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to year end 2023. Commercial loans increased 91.3 million, offset by decreases of 32.6 million, 8.0 million, 3.6 million, 0.7 million, 0.7 million and 0.4 million in residential construction, residential mortgage, SBA held for sale, SBA PPP, SBA held for investment and consumer loans, respectively. Below is a table of the geographic loan allocation of the Bank s Commercial loan portfolio at September 30, 2024: 

New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Other Commercial loans Commercial construction 88.4 6.9 4.7 SBA 504 88.2 1.6 9.7 0.5 Commercial industrial 96.0 1.7 1.1 1.2 Commercial mortgage - owner occupied 89.8 4.3 2.7 3.2 Commercial mortgage - nonowner occupied 86.2 3.8 3.8 6.2 Other 96.2 2.5 0.8 0.5 Total 89.6 3.9 3.2 3.3 Average loans increased 20.6 million or 1.0 percent to 2.2 billion the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.1 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase in average loans was due to increases in average commercial and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in average residential construction, SBA, consumer and SBA PPP loans. The yield on the overall loan portfolio increased 52 basis points to 6.53 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year. SBA 7(a) loans, on which the SBA historically has provided guarantees of up to 90 percent of the principal balance, are considered a higher risk loan product for the Company than its other loan products. These loans are made for the purposes of providing working capital or financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate. Generally, an SBA 7(a) loan has a deficiency in its credit profile that would not allow the borrower to qualify for a traditional commercial loan, which is why the SBA provides the guarantee. The deficiency may be a higher loan to value LTV ratio, lower debt service coverage DSC ratio or weak personal financial guarantees. In addition, many SBA 7(a) loans are for startup businesses where there is no history or financial information. Finally, many SBA borrowers do not have an ongoing and continuous banking relationship with the Bank, but merely work with the Bank on a single transaction. The guaranteed portion of the Company s SBA loans may be sold in the secondary market. SBA 7(a) loans held for sale, carried at the lower of cost or market, amounted to 14.6 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.6 million from 18.2 million at December 31, 2023. SBA 7(a) loans held for investment amounted to 37.9 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.7 million from 38.6 million at December 31, 2023. The yield on SBA loans, which are generally floating and adjust quarterly to the Prime rate, was 9.05 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.89 percent for the same period in the prior year. The Company sold 0.9 million of SBA loans during the three months ended ended September 30, 2024. 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 The guarantee rates on SBA 7(a) loans range from 50 percent to 90 percent, with the majority of the portfolio having a guarantee rate of 75 percent at origination. The guarantee rates are determined by the SBA and can vary from year to year depending on government funding and the goals of the SBA program. Approximately 74.2 million and 75.6 million in SBA loans were sold but serviced by the Company at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are not included on the Company s Balance Sheet. There is no relationship or correlation between the guarantee percentages and the level of charge-offs and recoveries on the Company s SBA 7(a) loans. Charge-offs taken on SBA 7(a) loans effect the unguaranteed portion of the loan. SBA loans are underwritten to the same credit standards irrespective of the guarantee percentage. Commercial loans are generally made in the Company s marketplace for the purpose of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes. These loans amounted to 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 91.3 million from year end 2023. The yield on commercial loans was 6.49 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.03 percent for the same period in 2023. In most cases, these loans are secured by underlying real estate collateral. SBA 504 program loans, which consist of real estate backed commercial mortgages where the Company has the first mortgage and the SBA has the second mortgage on the property, are included in the Commercial loan portfolio. At September 30, 2024, Commercial Mortgage Owner Occupied, Commercial Mortgage Nonowner Occupied, and Commercial Construction represent 25.2 percent, 18.6 percent and 6.0 percent of the Company s loan portfolio, respectively. The Company will generally not exceed a combined loan-to-value ratio of 75 percent at origination. Unity continually evaluates and monitors its credit risk policies and procedures. Further, Unity continuously monitors loan portfolio concentrations across key credit characteristics (e.g., state and local geographies, industries, etc.). Loans are subject to periodic loan review procedures in accordance with the Company s Loan Policy. A portion of the loan reviews are performed by an independent and external loan review function. Residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by 1 to 4 family residential properties. These loans amounted to 623.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8.0 million from year end 2023. Sales of conforming mortgage loans totaled 48.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to sales of 44.8 million in the prior year period. The yield on residential mortgages was 6.00 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.38 percent for the same period in 2023. Residential mortgage loans maintained in portfolio are generally to individuals that do not qualify for conventional financing. In extending credit to this category of borrowers, the Bank considers other mitigating factors such as credit history, equity and liquid reserves of the borrower. As a result, the residential mortgage loan portfolio of the Bank includes adjustable rate mortgages with rates that exceed the rates on conventional fixed-rate mortgage loan products but which are not considered high priced mortgages. Consumer loans consist of home equity loans and loans for the purpose of financing the purchase of consumer goods, home improvements and other personal needs, and are generally secured by 1 to 4 family residences. These loans amounted to 72.3 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.4 million from year end 2023. The yield on consumer loans was 7.90 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.51 percent for the same period in 2023. Residential construction loans consist of short-term loans for the purpose of funding the costs of building a home. These loans amounted to 98.7 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 32.6 million from year end 2023. The yield on residential construction loans was 8.38 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.79 percent for the same period in 2023. There are no concentrations of loans to any borrowers or group of borrowers exceeding 10 percent of the total loan portfolio.

 In the normal course of business, the Company may originate loan products whose terms could give rise to additional credit risk. Interest-only loans, loans with high LTV, construction loans with payments made from interest reserves and multiple loans supported by the same collateral (e.g. home equity loans) are examples of such products. However, these products are not material to the Company s financial position and are closely managed via credit controls designed to mitigate their additional inherent risk. Management does not believe that these products create a concentration of credit risk in the Company s loan portfolio. The Company does not have any option adjustable rate mortgage loans. The majority of the Company s loans are secured by real estate. Declines in the market values of real estate in the Company s trade area impact the value of the collateral securing its loans. This could lead to greater losses in the event of defaults on loans secured by real estate. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 96 percent of the Company s loan portfolio was secured by real estate. The following table sets forth the classification of loans by loan type, including unearned fees and deferred costs and excluding the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

In thousands, except percentages September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 SBA loans SBA loans held for sale 14,621 0.6 18,242 0.8 SBA loans held for investment 37,904 1.7 38,584 1.8 SBA PPP 1,593 0.1 2,318 0.1 Total SBA loans 54,118 2.4 59,144 2.7 Commercial loans Commercial construction 132,363 6.0 129,159 6.0 SBA 504 45,307 2.0 33,669 1.7 Commercial industrial 139,635 6.3 128,402 5.9 Commercial mortgage - owner occupied 559,275 25.2 502,397 23.1 Commercial mortgage - nonowner occupied 412,722 18.6 424,490 19.5 Other 79,461 3.6 59,343 2.7 Total commercial loans 1,368,763 61.7 1,277,460 58.9 Residential mortgage loans 623,529 28.1 631,506 29.1 Consumer loans Home equity 68,838 3.1 67,037 3.0 Consumer other 3,453 0.2 5,639 0.3 Total consumer loans 72,291 3.3 72,676 3.3 Residential construction 98,692 4.5 131,277 6.0 Total gross loans 2,217,393 100.0 2,172,063 100.0 For additional information on loans, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Quality 

Nonperforming loans were 13.0 million at September 30, 2024, a 6.2 million decrease from 19.2 million at December 31, 2023 and a 5.1 million decrease from 18.1 million at September 30, 2023, respectively. Since year end 2023, nonperforming loans in the residential mortgage, consumer and residential construction segments decreased, offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in the SBA and commercial segments. In addition, there were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.9 million of these loans at December 31, 2023 and 0.3 of these loans million at September 30, 2023. Further, there was no other real estate owned at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, compared to 0.3 million of other real estate owned at September 30, 2023.

 The Company also monitors potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are those loans where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms. These loans are categorized by their non-passing risk rating and performing loan status. Potential problem loans totaled 14.8 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.3 million from 15.1 million at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming securities were 2.9 million at September 30, 2024, a 2.9 million increase from none at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. The Company owns 5 million in par of this position and moved the position into non-accrual status during the three months ending June 30, 2024. This security is currently paying and all payments received since have been applied to principal. See Note 7 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Asset Quality. Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments The allowance for credit losses totaled 27.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 25.9 million at December 31, 2023 and at September 30, 2023, with a resulting allowance to total loan ratio of 1.22 percent at September 30, 2024 and 1.19 percent at both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs amounted to 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 1.5 million for the same period in 2023. The Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated expected losses. Adjustments to the reserve are made through provision for credit losses and applied to the reserve which is classified in Other liabilities. At September 30, 2024, the commitment reserve totaled 0.7 million, compared to 0.6 million at December 31, 2023. See Note 8 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments. Deposits Deposits, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits and time deposits, are the primary source of the Company s funds. The Company offers a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with primary focus on building and expanding relationships. The Company continues to focus on establishing a comprehensive relationship with business borrowers, seeking deposits as well as lending relationships. Total deposits increased 122.0 million to 2.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from year-end 2023. This increase was due to increases of 131.2 million in time deposits, 27.1 million in savings deposits, 13.1 million in interest bearing demand deposits and 4.3 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease of 53.7 million in brokered deposits. The change in the composition of the portfolio from December 31, 2023 reflects a 30.8 percent increase in time deposits, 5.5 percent increase in savings deposits, 4.2 percent increase in interest bearing demand deposits and a 1.0 percent increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a 20.0 percent decrease in brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2024, 19.1 percent of total deposits were uninsured or uncollateralized. The Company s deposit composition as of September 30, 2024, consisted of 20.7 percent in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, 15.9 percent in interest-bearing demand deposits, 27.4 percent in savings deposits and 36.0 percent in time deposits.

 Borrowed Funds and Subordinated Debentures As part of the Company s overall funding and liquidity management program, from time to time the Company borrows from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. Residential mortgages and commercial loans collateralize these borrowings. Borrowed funds and subordinated debentures totaled 277.1 million and 366.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are broken down in the following table: 

(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 FHLB borrowings: Non-overnight, fixed rate advances 23,798 109,438 Overnight advances 178,000 217,000 Puttable advances 65,000 30,000 Subordinated debentures 10,310 10,310 Total borrowed funds and subordinated debentures 277,108 366,748 In September 2024, the FHLB issued a 175.0 million municipal deposit letter of credit in the name of Unity Bank naming the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance as beneficiary, to secure municipal deposits as required under New Jersey law.

At September 30, 2024, the Company held 194.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Further, the Company maintained approximately 569.4 million of funding available from various funding sources, including the FHLB, FRB Discount Window and other lines of credit. Additionally, the Company can pledge securities for further borrowing capacity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average FHLB Borrowings were 140 million with a weighted average cost of 3.77 . Subordinated Debentures On July 24, 2006, Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of Unity Bancorp, Inc., issued 10.0 million of floating rate capital trust pass through securities to investors due on July 24, 2036. The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or part. The floating interest rate on the subordinated debentures is the daily compounded SOFR rate with a 0.262 percent spread. The floating interest rate was 6.605 percent at September 30, 2024 and 7.212 percent at December 31, 2023. Market Risk Market risk for the Company is primarily limited to interest rate risk, which is the impact that changes in interest rates would have on future earnings. The Company s Risk Management Committee RMC manages this risk. The principal objectives of the RMC are to establish prudent risk management guidelines, evaluate and control the level of interest rate risk in balance sheet accounts, determine the level of appropriate risk given the business focus, operating environment and capital and liquidity requirements and actively manage risk within Board-approved guidelines. The RMC reviews the maturities and repricing of loans, investments, deposits and borrowings, cash flow needs, current market conditions and interest rate levels.

 Liquidity Liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due. A bank s liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace. Our liquidity is monitored by management and the Board of Directors, which reviews historical funding requirements, our current liquidity position, sources and stability of funding, marketability of assets, options for attracting additional funds, and anticipated future funding needs, including the level of unfunded commitments. Our goal is to maintain sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in order to minimize our dependence on volatile and potentially unstable funding markets. The principal sources of funds at the Bank are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of investment and loan principal, sales and maturities of investment securities, additional borrowings and funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides detail on the Company s sources and uses of cash, as well as an indication of the Company s ability to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. At September 30, 2024, the balance of cash and cash equivalents was 194.5 million, a decrease of 0.3 million from December 31, 2023. A discussion of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity follows. Securities. The Company s available for sale investment portfolio amounted to 97.7 million and 91.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Projected cash flows from securities based on current estimates over the next twelve months are 14.2 million. Loans. The SBA loans held for sale portfolio amounted to 14.6 million and 18.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Sales of these loans provide an additional source of liquidity for the Company. Commitments. The Company was committed to advance approximately 329.1 million to its borrowers as of September 30, 2024, compared to 312.5 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, 172.1 million of these commitments expire within one year, compared to 149.3 million at December 31, 2023. The Company had 5.8 million and 5.7 million in standby letters of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which are included in the commitments amount noted above. The estimated fair value of these guarantees is not significant. The Company believes it has the necessary liquidity to honor all commitments. Many of these commitments will expire and never be funded. Deposits. As of September 30, 2024, deposits included 384.6 million of government deposits, as compared to 346.3 million at year end 2023. These deposits are generally short in duration and are very sensitive to price competition. The Company believes that the current level of these types of deposits is appropriate. Included in the portfolio were 352.9 million of deposits from 22 municipalities with account balances in excess of 5.0 million. The withdrawal of these deposits, in whole or in part, would not create a liquidity shortfall for the Company. Borrowed Funds. Total FHLB borrowings amounted to 266.8 million and 356.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, the Company can borrow additional funds based on the market value of collateral pledged. At September 30, 2024, pledging provided an additional 569.4 million in borrowing potential from the FHLB, FRB and other sources. In addition, the Company can pledge additional collateral in the form of 1 to 4 family residential mortgages, commercial loans or investment securities to increase these lines with the FHLB and FRB. For further detail on cash flow activity, refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Regulatory Capital Consistent with our goal to operate as a sound and profitable financial organization, Unity Bancorp, Inc. and Unity Bank actively seek to maintain our well capitalized status in accordance with regulatory standards. As of Septemeber 30, 2024, Unity Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the federal banking regulators and was considered well capitalized.

 See Note 11 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Regulatory Capital Shareholders Equity Repurchase Plan On April 27, 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 500 thousand shares, or approximately 5.0 of the Company s outstanding common stock. On August 1, 2024, a new repurchase plan was authorized by the Board covering up to 500 thousand shares, or approximately 5.0 of the Company s outstanding common stock. A total of 10,334 shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of 27.27 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 685 thousand shares are available for repurchase. The timing and amount of additional purchases, if any, will depend upon a number of factors including the Company s capital needs, the performance of its loan portfolio, the need for additional provisions for credit losses and the market price of the Company s stock. The table below provides details of our repurchases during the last quarter: 

Total Number of Maximum Number Total Weighted Shares Purchased of Shares that may Number of Average as Part of Publicly yet be Purchased Shares Price Paid Announced Plans Under the Plans Period Purchased per Share or Programs or Programs July 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 10,334 27.27 10,334 184,645 August 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 684,645 September 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 684,645 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The financial statements and notes thereto, presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes in the Company s assessment of market risk as reported in Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. (See Interest Rate Sensitivity in Management s Discussion and Analysis herein.) ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures a) The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for recording,

 processing, summarizing and reporting the information the Company is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. b) No significant change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s controls over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company currently is not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that it believes will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, or the results of the operation of the Company.
