Sale of Minehut 

On February 29, 2024, the Company sold its Minehut related assets Minehut Assets to GamerSafer, Inc. GamerSafer ), in a transaction approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement entered into by and between GamerSafer and the Company on February 26, 2024 (the GS Agreement ), the Company will receive million of purchase consideration Purchase Consideration for the Minehut Assets, which amount will be paid by GamerSafer in revenue and royalty sharing over a multiple year period, as described in the GS Agreement (the Minehut Sale ).

Super League and GamerSafer will maintain a commercial relationship which ensures that Minehut can remain an ongoing destination available to Super League s partners. 

Bylaw Amendment 

On June 4, 2024, the Board of Directors (the Board of the Company approved an amendment (the Amendment to the Company s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective June 4, 2024, to reduce the number of shares that are required to be present at a meeting of the Company s stockholders (a Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. Prior to the Amendment, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock was required to establish a quorum for the transaction of business at a Meeting. As approved in the Amendment, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of not less than one-third (1/3) of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a Meeting. 

The Board adopted the Amendment to more practically obtain a quorum and conduct business at a Meeting. The Board based its decision on the increasing prevalence of brokerage firms opting to forgo discretionary or proportionate voting of the shares held by them in street name, which is making it increasingly difficult for companies with a large retail stockholder base to obtain a quorum of the majority. The change to the quorum requirement was made to improve the Company s ability to hold Meetings when called. 

million as of September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities totaled million and million, respectively. 

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. To date, our principal sources of capital used to fund our operations and growth have been the net proceeds received from equity and debt financings. We have and will continue to use significant capital for the growth and development of our business, and, as such, we expect to seek additional capital either from operations, or that may be available from future issuance(s) of common stock, preferred stock and / or debt financings, to fund our planned operations. Accordingly, our results of operations and the implementation of our long-term business strategies have been and could continue to be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control. The most recent global financial crisis caused by severe geopolitical conditions, including conflicts abroad, and the threat of other outbreaks or pandemics, have resulted in extreme volatility, disruptions and downward pressure on stock prices and trading volumes across the capital and credit markets in which we traditionally operate. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us, including limiting our ability to obtain additional funding from the capital and credit markets. In management s judgement, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern as contemplated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ), Topic 205-40, Going Concern, ASC 205 ). 

Management s Plans 

During the prior fiscal year and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued our focus on the expansion of our service offerings and revenue growth opportunities through internal development, collaborations, and through opportunistic strategic acquisitions, as well as management and reduction of operating costs. Management continues to explore alternatives for raising capital to facilitate our growth and execute our business strategy, including strategic partnerships and or other forms of equity or debt financings. 

In September 2024, the Company announced the iR Transaction as described above. 

On October 24, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a certain accredited investor for the registered direct offering of an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Shares ), at a purchase price of per Share (the Registered Direct Offering ). The Registered Direct Offering closed on October 25, 2024, and resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately million. 

On November 8, 2024 (the Effective Date ), the Company and its subsidiary, InPVP, LLC Subsidiary ), entered into a Business Loan and Security Agreement (the Agile Loan Agreement ), with Agile Capital Funding, LLC as collateral agent Collateral Agent ), and Agile Lending, LLC Agile ), pursuant to which the Company issued to Agile a Confessed Judgment Secured Promissory Note for an aggregate value of million (the Agile Note ). Pursuant to the Agile Loan Agreement: (i) the Agile Note matures weeks from the Effective Date; (ii) carries an aggregate total interest payment of approximately million (the Applicable Rate ), and (iii) immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (as defined in the Agile Loan Agreement), interest shall accrue at a fixed per annum rate equal to the Applicable Rate plus five percent. The Company is required to repay all the obligations due under the Agile Loan Agreement and the Agile Note in 28 equal payments of 93,821.43 , with the first payment being made to Agile on November 14, 2024, and every seven days thereafter until the Maturity Date. The proceeds received from the Agile Note will be used to fund general working capital needs. For more information on the Agile Loan Agreement and the Agile Note, refer to Note 8. 

The Company considers historical operating results, costs, capital resources and financial position, in combination with current projections and estimates, as part of its plan to fund operations over a reasonable period. Management s considerations assume, among other things, that the Company will continue to be successful implementing its business strategy, that there will be no material adverse developments in the business, liquidity or capital requirements, and the Company will be able to raise additional equity and / or debt financing on acceptable terms. If one or more of these factors do not occur as expected, it could cause a reduction or delay of the Company s business activities, sales of material assets, default on its obligations, or forced insolvency. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not contain any adjustments which might be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. 

We may continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions. To finance such strategic acquisitions, we may find it necessary to raise additional equity capital, incur debt, or both. Any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through issuances of equity or debt, or other external financing. However, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption periodically and such volatility and disruption may occur in the future. If we fail to obtain additional financing when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans which, in turn, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies. 

Each impression is considered a good or service that is distinct under the revenue standard, and the performance obligation under our on-platform media contracts is the delivery of a series of impressions. Each impression required to be delivered in the series that we promise to transfer to the Brand meets the criteria to be a performance obligation satisfied over time, due to the fact that (1) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (2) we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date per the terms of the contract. Further, the same method is used to measure our progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each distinct impression, as in the transfer of the series of impressions to the customer, which is based on actual delivery of impressions. As such, we account for the specified series of impressions as a single performance obligation. 

The delivery of the impression on platform represents the change in control of the good or service, and therefore, the Company satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue based on the delivery of impressions under the contract. 

Influencer Marketing 

Influencer marketing revenue is generated in connection with the development, management and execution of influencer marketing campaigns on behalf of Brands, primarily on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Influencer marketing campaigns are collaborations between Super League, popular social-media influencers, and Brands, to promote a Brands products or services. Influencers are paid a flat rate per post to feature a Brand s product or service on their respective social media outlets. 

For influencer marketing campaigns that include multiple influencers, the customer can benefit from the influencer posts either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer. Our influencer marketing campaigns for Brands (1) incorporate a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract (typically additional influencer posts) into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output that the customer has contracted for, and (2) the goods or services are interdependent in that each of the goods or services is affected by one or more of the other goods or services in the contract which combined, create an influencer marketing campaign to satisfy the Brand s specific campaign objectives. The interdependency of the performance obligations is supported by an understanding of what a customer expects to receive as a final product with respect to an influencer marketing campaign, which is an integrated influencer marketing advertising campaign that the influencer posts create when they are combined into an overall integrated campaign. 

Our customers receive and consume the benefits of each influencer s post as the content is posted on the influencers respective social media outlet. In addition, the influencer marketing campaigns and videos created by influencers are highly customized advertising engagements, where Brand specific assets and collateral are created for the customer based on specific and customized specifications, and therefore, does not create an asset with an alternative use. Further, based on contract terms, we typically have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date during the term of the arrangement. 

We recognize revenues for influencer marketing campaigns based on input methods which recognize revenue on the basis of the entity s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. As such, revenues are recognized over the term of the campaign, as the influencer videos are posted, based on costs incurred to date relative to total costs for the influencer marketing campaign. 

Publishing and Content Studio 

Publishing and content studio revenue consists of revenue generated from immersive game development and custom game experiences within our owned and affiliate game worlds, and revenue generated in connection with our production, curation and distribution of entertainment content for our own network of digital channels and media and entertainment partner channels. 

Publishing 

Custom builds are highly customized branded game experiences created and built by Super League for customers on existing digital platforms such as Roblox, Fortnite, Decentraland and others. Custom builds often include the creation of highly customized and branded gaming experiences and other campaign specific media or products to create an overall customized immersive world campaign. 

Custom integrations are highly customized advertising campaigns that are integrated into and run on existing affiliate Roblox gaming experiences. Custom integrations will often include the creation of highly customized and branded game integration elements to be integrated into the existing Roblox gaming experience to the customers specifications and other campaign specific media or products. Prior to the Minehut Sale, we also created custom integrations on the digital property Minehut for Brands. 

Our custom builds and custom integration (hereinafter, Custom Programs campaign revenue arrangements typically include multiple promises and performance obligations, including requirements to design, create and launch a platform game, customize and enhance an existing game, deploy media products, and related performance measurement. Custom Programs offer a strategically integrated advertising campaign with multiple integrated components, and we provide a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or outputs that the customer has contracted for. As such, Custom Program revenue arrangements are combined into a single performance unit, as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and we typically have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date during the term of the arrangement. 

We recognize revenues for Custom Programs based on input methods, that recognize revenue based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations, utilizing primarily costs or direct labor hours incurred to date to estimate progress towards completion. 

Content Production 

Content production revenue is generated in connection with our production, curation and distribution of entertainment content for our own network of digital channels and media and entertainment partner channels. We distribute three primary types of content for syndication and licensing, including: (1) our own original programming content, (2) user generated content UGC ), including online gameplay and gameplay highlights, and (3) the creation of content for third parties utilizing our remote production and broadcast technology. 

Content production arrangements typically involve promises to provide a distinct set of videos, creative, content creation and or other live or remote production services. These services can be one-off in nature (relatively short services periods of one day to one week) or can be specified as monthly services over a multi-month period. 

One-off and monthly content production services are distinct in that the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer. Further, promises to provide one-off or monthly content production services are typically separately identifiable as the nature of the promises, within the context of the contract, is to transfer each of those goods or services individually. Each month s content production services are separate and not integrated with a prior month s or subsequent months services and do not represent a combined output; each months content production services do not modify any other prior period content production services, and the monthly services are not interdependent or highly interrelated. 

As a result, each one-off or monthly promise to provide content production services is a distinct good or service that we promise to transfer and are therefore performance obligations. In general, content production contracts do not meet the criteria for recognition of revenues over time as the customer typically does not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance as we perform, our performance does not typically create or enhance an asset that the customer controls, and while our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, we typically have a right to payment upon completion of each distinct performance obligation. 

A performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time if none of the criteria for satisfying a performance obligation over time are met. For content production arrangements, we have a right to payment and the customer has control of the good or service at the time of completion and delivery of the one-off or monthly content production services in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. As such, revenue is recognized at the time of completion of the one-off or monthly content production services. 

Direct to Consumer 

Direct to consumer revenue primarily consists of monthly digital subscription fees, and sales of in-game digital goods. Subscription revenue is recognized in the period the services are rendered. Payments are typically due from customers at the point of sale. 

InPvP Platform Generated Sales Transactions 

Through a relationship with Microsoft, the owner of Minecraft, we operate a Minecraft server world for players playing the game on consoles and tablets. We are one of seven partner servers with Microsoft that, while free to play, monetize the players through in-game micro transactions. We generate in-game platform sales revenue from the sale of digital goods, including cosmetic items, durable goods, player ranks and game modes, leveraging the flexibility of the Microsoft Minecraft Bedrock platform, and powered by the InPvP cloud architecture technology platform. Revenue is generated when transactions are facilitated between Microsoft and the end user, either via in-game currency or cash. 

InPvP revenues are generated from single transactions for various distinct digital goods sold to users in-game. Microsoft processes sales transactions and remits the applicable revenue share to us pursuant to the terms of the Microsoft agreement. 

Revenue for digital goods sold on the platform is recognized when Microsoft (our partner) collects the revenue and facilitates the transaction, including delivery of digital goods, on the platform. Revenue for such arrangements includes all revenue generated, make goods, and refunds of all transactions managed via the platform by Microsoft. Payments are made to the Company monthly based on the sales revenue generated on the platform.

Seasonality . Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second half of our fiscal year, with the fourth quarter typically representing our highest revenue quarter each year. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the second half of each year, reflecting the impact of seasonal back to school, game release and holiday season advertising spending by brands and advertisers. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect relatively higher advertising revenue in the second half of each year, compared to the first half of the year.

Upgrades or enhancements to existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the applicable estimated useful life. 

Transfer or Sale of Intangible Assets 

Upon the sale of an intangible asset, or group of intangible assets (hereinafter, nonfinancial assets ), the Company initially evaluates whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the legal entity that holds the nonfinancial assets by applying the guidance on consolidation. Any nonfinancial assets transferred that are held in a legal entity in which the Company does not have (or ceases to have) a controlling financial interest is further evaluated to determine whether the underlying transaction contract meets all of the criteria for accounting for contract under the revenue standard. Once a contract meets all of the criteria, the Company identifies each distinct nonfinancial asset promised to a counterparty and derecognizes each distinct nonfinancial asset when the Company transfers control of the nonfinancial asset to the counterparty. The Company evaluates the point in time at which a counterparty obtains control of the nonfinancial assets, including whether or not the counterparty can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, each distinct nonfinancial asset. 

If the consideration promised in a contract is variable or includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised assets to a counterparty. Purchase consideration is variable if the amount the Company will receive is contingent on future events occurring or not occurring, even though the amount itself is fixed. The Company determines the total transaction price, including an estimate of any variable consideration, at contract inception and reassesses this estimate at each reporting date. The Company estimates the transaction price utilizing the expected value method. The expected value is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. 

The accounting for an arrangement with a put option depends on the amount the Company must pay to the counterparty in the event the counterparty exercises the put option, and whether the counterparty has a significant economic incentive to exercise its right. The accounting for put options requires the Company to assess at contract inception, whether the counterparty has a significant economic incentive to exercise its right, including how the repurchase price compares to the expected market value of the nonfinancial assets at the date of repurchase and the amount of time until the right expires. A customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise a put option when the repurchase price is expected to significantly exceed the market value of the good at the time of repurchase. The Company accounts for a put option as a sale of an asset or group of assets with a right of return, if the repurchase price is less than the original sales price and the customer does not have a significant economic incentive to exercise its right.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired business over the acquisition date fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill recorded in connection with the Melon Acquisition is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining the operations and assets of Super League and Melon, and also includes residual value attributable to the assembled and trained workforce acquired in the acquisition. 

Management is primarily responsible for determining the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Melon Closing Date. Management considered a number of factors, including reference to a preliminary independent analysis of estimated fair values solely for the purpose of allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The analysis included a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis which estimated the future net cash flows expected to result from the respective assets acquired as of the Melon Closing Date. A discount rate consistent with the risks associated with achieving the estimated net cash flows was used to estimate the present value of future estimated net cash flows. The Company is in the process of finalizing the estimates and assumptions developed in connection with the independent analysis of estimated fair values of intangible assets acquired solely for the purpose of allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to the fair values of intangible assets acquired, or estimates of economic useful lives of the intangible assets acquired, could impact the carrying value of those assets and related goodwill, as well as the estimates of periodic amortization of intangible assets acquired to be reflected in the statement of operations. 

The fair values of the acquired intangible assets, as described above, was determined using the following methods:

Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method MPEE under the Income Approach 

MPEEM is an application of the DCF Method, whereby revenue derived from the intangible asset is estimated using the overall business revenue, adjusted for attrition, obsolescence, cost of goods sold, operating expense, and taxes. Required returns attributable to other assets employed in the business are subtracted. The excess earnings are attributable to the intangible asset and are discounted to present value at a rate of return to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset.

Relief-from-Royalty Method under the Income Approach 

Under the Relief-from-Royalty method, the royalty savings is calculated by estimating a reasonable royalty rate that a third-party would negotiate in a licensing agreement. Such royalties are most commonly expressed as a percentage of total revenue involving the technology.

Differential Cash Flows 

The Differential Cash Flows Approach is a version of the income approach that values an intangible asset as the present value of the cash flows that a company would lose if they did not have the asset in place. The differential cash flow is calculated as the difference between the cash flow assuming competition and the cash flow without competition.

Replacement Cost Method 

In the Replacement Cost Method, value is estimated by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with one of equivalent economic utility.

Common Stock Purchase Warrants 

Series AAA Junior-3 and Series AAA Junior-4 Warrants. The Series AAA Junior-3 and Series AAA Junior-4 subscription agreements entered into in September 2024, included the sale of an aggregate of units (the Units ), each Unit consisting of (i) one share of newly designated Series AAA-3 Junior Convertible Preferred Stock or Series AAA-4 Junior Convertible Preferred Stock, as reflected in the table above, and (ii) a warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrants ), at a purchase price of per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately . 

The Investor Warrants are exercisable at per share at the option of the holder, subject to adjustment, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and expire three years from the respective issue dates of the Units, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. The Investor Warrants contain customary adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and other corporate events, and contain price-based anti-dilution protections. Any price-based anti-dilution adjustments are conditioned on, and subject to, stockholder approval. 

The September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrant agreements also contain a provision that states that, upon exercise of the warrant by an investor, if for any reason the company fails to deliver the shares by the settlement date, the investor can require the company to make a cash payment Buy-In Provision ). The cash payment would be based on the amount (if any) that the investor lost by having to purchase shares in the open market because of the company s failure to deliver the shares. 

As a result of the Buy-In Provision, the ability to deliver shares upon exercise of the Investor Warrants in every circumstance is generally not within the control of the Company as contemplated by the accounting standards, and thus, a partial cash settlement may be required outside of the Company s control. As such, the September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrants do not meet the requirements for equity classification, and therefore, the fair value of the September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrants are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

Prior to the Amendment, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock was required to establish a quorum for the transaction of business at a Meeting. As approved in the Amendment, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of not less than one-third (1/3) of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a Meeting. 

The Board adopted the Amendment to more practically obtain a quorum and conduct business at a Meeting. The Board based its decision on the increasing prevalence of brokerage firms opting to forgo discretionary or proportionate voting of the shares held by them in street name, which is making it increasingly difficult for companies with a large retail stockholder base to obtain a quorum of the majority.

Seasonality 

Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second half of our fiscal year, with the fourth quarter typically representing our highest revenue quarter each year. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the second half of each year, reflecting the impact of seasonal back to school, game release and holiday season advertising spending by brands and advertisers. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect relatively higher advertising revenue in the second half of each year, compared to the first half of the year.

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023: 

Personnel costs decreased due to headcount reductions in various corporate, general and administrative functions in connection with ongoing cost reduction and optimization activities. 

Professional fees expense increased in fiscal 2024 due to additional audit and third-party valuation fees incurred in connection with various fiscal year 2023 complex, nonstandard transactions, including the Melon Acquisition and various technical accounting related aspects associated with preferred stock outstanding, and related freestanding equity instruments. 

Noncash stock compensation expense included in general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to a 150,000 net reduction in noncash stock compensation expense related to restricted stock units issued to a third-party consultant that were fully vested as of December 31, 2023, a 202,000 net reduction in noncash stock compensation expense in connection with the Executive Grant Modification described above, and a 183,000 net reduction due to fully vested equity awards as of the end of the prior year quarter with higher average grant date fair values than equity awards included in expense subsequent to September 30, 2023. The decrease also reflects a 224,000 net reduction in noncash stock compensation expense in connection with the Original PSUs, with an estimated average grant date fair value of 36.16 and which were fully expensed as of September 30, 2023, and the Modified PSUs, with an average grant date fair value of 8.00 and are amortized on an accelerated basis over the implied service period due to the utilization of a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the estimated fair value of the equity-based award. 

Other expense increased due to noncash legal settlement expense incurred in connection with the Pioneer Settlement, described above, comprised of 346,000 of noncash expense in connection with the issuance of 275,000 shares of common stock to Pioneer, and the noncash incremental fair value totaling 283,000, related to Pioneer and other AA AIRs, which were modified to include a reduction in exercise price and an extension of the exercise term, as described at Note 6. Other expense also included a 164,000 noncash legal settlement charge related to the adjustment of the estimated fair value (i.e. mark-to-market), as of the issuance date, for common stock issued pursuant to the Note Holder Settlement Agreement, as described above. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in information technology, insurance and other corporate costs in connection with ongoing cost reduction activities.

The transaction allows Super League to streamline its position in partnering with major brands to build, market, and operate 3D experiences across multiple immersive platforms, including open gaming powerhouses like Minecraft, and aligns with the Company s cost improvement initiatives. Super League and GamerSafer will maintain a commercial relationship which ensures that Minehut can remain an ongoing destination available to Super League s partners. The carrying value of Minehut related assets totaled 475,000 as of February 26, 2024, comprised of total carrying costs of 1,671,000, net of accumulated amortization of 1,196,000, and historically were included in intangible assets, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The Company recorded a receivable for the total estimated purchase consideration totaling 619,000, of which 224,000 is included in prepaid expense and other current assets and 395,000 is included in other receivables in noncurrent assets, and recognized a gain on sale of the Minehut Assets totaling 144,000, which is included in other income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Purchase Consideration in the GS Agreement is variable pursuant to the guidance set forth in ASC 606. Under ASC 606, purchase consideration is variable if the amount the Company will receive is contingent on future events occurring or not occurring, even though the amount itself is fixed. As such, the Company estimated the amount of consideration to which the Company will be entitled, in exchange for transferring the Minehut Assets to GamerSafer, utilizing the expected value method which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration outcomes over the applicable contractual payment period, resulting in an estimated receivable of 619,000.

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

Series AAA Junior -3 and Series AAA Junior 4 Warrants 

The Series AAA Junior-3 and Series AAA Junior-4 subscription agreements entered into in September 2024, included the sale of an aggregate of 1,096 units (the Units ), each Unit consisting of (i) one share of newly designated Series AAA-3 Junior Convertible Preferred Stock or Series AAA-4 Junior Convertible Preferred Stock, as reflected in the table above, and (ii) a warrant to purchase 1,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrants ), at a purchase price of 1,000 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately 1,096,000. 

The Investor Warrants are exercisable at 1.00 per share at the option of the holder, subject to adjustment, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and expire three years from the respective issue dates of the Units, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. The Investor Warrants contain customary adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and other corporate events, and contain price-based anti-dilution protections. Any price-based anti-dilution adjustments are conditioned on, and subject to, Stockholder Approval. 

The September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrant agreements also contain a provision that states that, upon exercise of the warrant by an investor, if for any reason the company fails to deliver the shares by the settlement date, the investor can require the company to make a cash payment Buy-In Provision ). The cash payment would be based on the amount (if any) that the investor lost by having to purchase shares in the open market because of the company s failure to deliver the shares. 

As a result of the Buy-In Provision, the ability to deliver shares upon exercise of the Investor Warrants in every circumstance is generally not within the control of the Company as contemplated by the accounting standards, and thus, a partial cash settlement may be required outside of the Company s control. As such, the September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrants do not meet the requirements for equity classification, and therefore, the fair value of the September 2024 Series AAA Junior Investor Warrants are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to the table below. 

Placement Agent Warrants 

The Placement Agent Warrants issued in connection with the Series A Preferred Stock, Series AA Preferred Stock and Series AAA Preferred Stock (including the Exchange), described above, include provisions that are triggered in the event of the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the underlying warrant agreement, which contemplates the potential for certain transactions that result in a third-party acquiring more than 50 of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for cash or other assets. Given the existence of multiple classes of voting stock for the Company, as described above, the Fundamental Transaction provisions in the warrant agreements could result in a 50 or more change in ownership of outstanding common stock, without a 50 change in voting interests. As such, the Placement Agent Warrants are not eligible for the scope exception under ASC 815, and therefore, the fair value of the Placement Agent Warrants are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

Interest Expense 

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of interest paid or accrued in connection with the SLR Facility, totaling 19,000 and 52,000, respectively, and accrued interest expense in connection with the Super Biz Note issued in August 2024, as described below, totaling 25,000 and 25,000, respectively. 

Loss on Extinguishment of Liability 

In August 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Founders in connection with the remaining Super Biz Second Earn Out Period accrued contingent consideration outstanding, with a principle amount totaling approximately 1.8 million, whereby the Company is obligated to pay the outstanding contingent consideration on the following repayment terms Super Biz Note ). 

Interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 8.5 per annum, and accrues until the earlier of (i) repayment of the Super Biz Note in full, or (ii) the Maturity Date. 

In addition, in connection with the issuance of the Super Biz Note, during the period commencing January 2, 2025 and concluding on January 6, 2025, the Company will issue 98,438 shares of the Company s common stock to the Founders, valued at 336,000, based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the promissory note. 

The issuance of the Super Biz Note in exchange for the related accrued contingent consideration balance was accounted for as an extinguishment of the original liability due to the fact that the present value of the cash flows under the terms of Super Biz Note was determined to be at least 10 percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original obligation. As a result, a gain on extinguishment totaling 336,000 was recorded in the statement of operations, and credited to additional paid in capital (included in Other in the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity), for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of the fair value of the 98,438 shares of restricted stock (based on closing price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the Super Biz Note) to be issued, as described above. 

The default interest provision included in the Super Biz Note represents an embedded derivative with a fair value of 171,000 as of August 1, 2024, the date of issuance of the Super Biz Note. The fair value of the derivative liability is included in the September 30, 2024 balance sheet under the caption Promissory note contingent consideration, and is required to be marked to market at each balance sheet.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General 

Cash and cash equivalents totaled 0.3 million and 7.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented reflects the impact of operating, investing and financing cash flow related activities as described below. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred net losses, including significant noncash charges, as reflected in the summary condensed consolidated results of operation above, and had an accumulated deficit of 263.7 million as of September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 8.2 million. 

To date, our principal sources of capital used to fund our operations and growth have been the net proceeds received from equity and debt financings. We have and will continue to use significant capital for the growth and development of our business, and, as such, we expect to seek additional capital either from operations, or that may be available from future issuance(s) of common stock, preferred stock and / or debt financings, to fund our planned operations. Accordingly, our results of operations and the implementation of our long-term business strategies have been and could continue to be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control. The most recent global financial crisis caused by severe geopolitical conditions, including conflicts abroad, and the threat of other outbreaks or pandemics, have resulted in extreme volatility, disruptions and downward pressure on stock prices and trading volumes across the capital and credit markets in which we traditionally operate. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us, including limiting our ability to obtain additional funding from the capital and credit markets. In management s judgement, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern as contemplated by FASB ASC 205-40, Going Concern, ASC 205 ). 

Management s Plans 

In September 2024, the Company announced the iR Transaction as described above. 

On October 24, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with a certain accredited investor for the registered direct offering of an aggregate of 1,136,364 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Shares ), at a purchase price of 0.88 per Share (the Registered Direct Offering ). The Registered Direct Offering close on or about October 25, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in the Purchase Agreement, and resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately 1.0 million. 

On November 8, 2024 (the Effective Date ), the Company and its subsidiary, InPVP, LLC Subsidiary ), entered into a Business Loan and Security Agreement (the Agile Loan Agreement ), with Agile Capital Funding, LLC as collateral agent Collateral Agent ), and Agile Lending, LLC Agile ), pursuant to which the Company issued to Agile a Confessed Judgment Secured Promissory Note for an aggregate value of 1.85 million (the Agile Note ). Pursuant to the Agile Loan Agreement: (i) the Agile Note matures 28 weeks from the Effective Date; (ii) carries an aggregate total interest payment of approximately 0.78 million (the Applicable Rate ), and (iii) immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (as defined in the Agile Loan Agreement), interest shall accrue at a fixed per annum rate equal to the Applicable Rate plus five percent. The Company is required to repay all the obligations due under the Agile Loan Agreement and the Agile Note in 28 equal payments of 93,821.43, with the first payment being made to Agile on November 14, 2024, and every seven days thereafter until the Maturity Date. The proceeds received from the Agile Note will be used to fund general working capital needs. For more information on the Agile Loan Agreement and the Agile Note, refer to Note 8 of the accompanying financial statements. 

Management continues to explore alternatives for raising capital to facilitate our growth and execute our business strategy, including strategic partnerships and or other forms of equity or debt financings. We may continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions. To finance such strategic acquisitions, we may find it necessary to raise additional equity capital, incur debt, or both. Any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through issuances of equity or debt, or other external financing. However, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption periodically and such volatility and disruption may occur in the future. If we fail to obtain additional financing when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans which, in turn, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies.

Account Receivable Financing Facility 

The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Borrowers ), entered into a Financing and Security Agreement (the SLR Agreement with SLR Digital Finance, LLC Lender ), effective December 17, 2023 (the Facility Effective Date ). Pursuant to the SLR Agreement, Lender may, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make certain cash advances to the Company (each an Advance , and collectively, Advances ), against the face amounts of certain uncollected accounts receivable of the Borrowers on an account-by-account basis (each, a Financed Account , and collectively, the Accounts ), at a rate of 85 multiplied by the face value of such Account (the Advance Rate ), less any reserved funds and any other amounts due to Lender from Borrowers, up to a maximum aggregate Advance amount of 4,000,000 (the Maximum Amount )(the Advances on the Accounts is hereinafter, the Facility ). Upon receipt of any Advance, Borrowers will have assigned all of its rights in such receivables and all proceeds thereof. The proceeds received from the Facility are, and will be, used to fund general working capital needs. 

The SLR Agreement is effective for 24 months from the Facility Effective Date (the Term ), automatically extends for successive Terms (each, a Renewal Term ), and the Borrowers are obligated to pay the Lender an early termination fee in the event the SLR Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances prior to the end of any Term or Renewal Term, as more specifically set forth in the SLR Agreement. 

In connection with the Facility, the Company agreed to, among other things, (i) pay a finance fee equal to 2 of the Maximum Amount, payable in 24 equal monthly installments on the last day of each month of the Term until paid in full, (ii) pay a servicing fee equal to 0.30 multiplied by the actual average daily amount of Advances outstanding at the time of determination (the Outstanding Amount for the applicable month, on the last day of each calendar month during the Term (or so long as any obligations arising under the SLR Agreement are outstanding); (iii) be charged a monthly financing fee (the Financing Fee ), due upon receipt of full payment of a Financed Account by Lender, equal to 1/12 of (a) the prime rate plus 2 (the Facility Rate ), multiplied by (b) the amount of the Outstanding Amount; and (iv) utilize the facility such that the monthly average aggregate Advances outstanding is at 400,000 (the Minimum Utilization ). In the event that Borrower s monthly utilization is less than the applicable Minimum Utilization for any month, the Financing Fee for such month shall be calculated as if the applicable Minimum Utilization has been satisfied. 

Furthermore, the SLR Agreement imposes various restrictions on the activities of the Borrowers, including a prohibition on fundamental changes to the Company or its subsidiaries (including certain consolidations, mergers and sales and transfers of assets, and limitations on the ability of the Borrowers to grant liens upon their property or assets). The SLR Agreement includes standard Events of Default (as defined in the SLR Agreement), and provide that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, Lender may, among other things, immediately collect any obligation owing to Lender under the SLR Agreement, cease advancing money to the Borrowers, take possession of any collateral, and/or charge interest at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) 6 above the Facility Rate, and (ii) the highest default rate permitted by applicable law. 

As security for the full and prompt payment and performance of any obligations arising under the SLR Agreement, the Borrowers granted to Lender a continuing first priority security interest in all the assets of the Borrowers. The SLR Agreement also provides for customary provisions, including representations, warranties and covenants, indemnification, waiver of jury trial, arbitration, and the exercise of remedies upon a breach or default. 

Transfers of financial assets that do not qualify for sale accounting are reported as collateralized borrowings. Financing and servicing fees calculated with reference to amounts advanced under the AR Facility are included in interest expense. The commitment fee, based on the maximum facility amount and payable irrespective of drawdowns, is expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the AR Facility.

			 A portion of the proceeds received subsequent to September 30, 2024. Receivable totaling 300,000 included in additional paid in capital as of September 30, 2024. 

Use of net proceeds included working capital, general corporate purposes, and certain indebtedness (Series A Preferred only), including sales and marketing activities and product development. As disclosed at Note 5, in the event the Company consummated a subsequent equity financing during the term of the Notes, the Company was required, at the option of the Note Holders, to use 50 of the gross proceeds raised from such sale to redeem all or any portion of the Notes outstanding upon closing of such equity financing. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, 719,000 of the net proceeds from the Series A Offerings were utilized in connection with the redemption of the Notes. 

Equity Financing 

On August 21, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. (the Underwriter ), relating to the Company s public offering (the Common Stock Offering of 778,653 shares of its common stock, par value 0.001 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 67,500 shares of the Company s common stock, in lieu of the Company s common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants , and collectively with the Shares, the Firm Securities to certain investors. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted the Underwriters a 45-day option Option to purchase an additional 126,923 shares of the Company s common stock and/or Pre-Funded Warrants (the Option Securities , and together with the Firm Securities, the Securities ). On September 12, 2023, the Underwriter partially exercised its Option and purchased an additional 32,616 shares of common stock at a price of 2.60 per share. The issuance by the Company of the Option Securities resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately 84,800, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses payable by the Company. 

On August 23, 2023, the Company issued the Firm Securities and closed the Offering at a public price of 2.60 per share, and 2.58 per share underlying each Pre-Funded Warrant, for net proceeds to the Company of approximately 1.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

Table of Contents 

Each Pre-Funded Warrant had an exercise price per share of common stock equal to 0.001 per share. The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each Pre-Funded Warrant was subject to appropriate adjustments in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the common stock. Under the Pre-Funded Warrants, a holder would not be entitled to exercise any portion of any Pre-Funded Warrant that, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause: (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by such holder (together with its affiliates) to exceed 4.99 of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise; or (ii) the combined voting power of the Company s securities beneficially owned by such holder (together with its affiliates) to exceed 4.99 of the combined voting power of all of the Company s securities outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrant, which percentage may be changed at the holder s election to a higher or lower percentage not in excess of 9.99 upon 61 days notice to the Company. In addition, in certain circumstances, upon a fundamental transaction, a holder of Pre-Funded Warrants would be entitled to receive, upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that such holder would have received had they exercised the Pre-Funded Warrants immediately prior to the fundamental transaction. The Pre-Funded Warrants were fully exercised as of August 29, 2023. 

The Firm Securities were offered, issued, and sold pursuant to a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on Form S-3 (File No. 333-259347) (the Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated August 23, 2023, relating to the Securities (together with the accompanying base prospectus, dated September 7, 2021, the Prospectus Supplement ), filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act on August 23, 2023. 

Convertible Debt. On May 16, 2022, as summarized above and further described at Note 5, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with three institutional investors, providing for the sale and issuance of a new series of senior convertible notes in the aggregate original principal amount of 4,320,000, of which 8 is an original issue discount. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the Notes and related accrued interest totaled 719,000, which was subsequently paid in full during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures, nor do we have any committed lines of credit, other committed funding or long-term debt, and no guarantees. As of September 30, 2024 we maintain approximately 3,200 square feet of office space, 1,650 square feet of which is on a month-to-month basis, and 1,550 square feet of which is subject to a two-year lease, commencing on August 1, 2021. 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financial guarantees or other off-balance sheet commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder s equity or that are not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us. 

Contingencies 

Certain conditions may exist as of the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company s management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of these condensed consolidated statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that are considered critical may be found in the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023, as amended. In addition, refer to Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. The following accounting policies were identified during the current period, based on activities occurring during the current period, as critical and requiring significant judgments and estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company generates revenue from (i) innovative advertising including immersive game world and experience publishing and in-game media products, (ii) content and technology through the production and distribution of our own, advertiser and third-party content, and (iii) direct to consumer offers, including in-game items, e-commerce, game passes and digital collectibles. 

Revenue is recognized when the Company transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services and when the customer obtains control of the good or service. In this regard, revenue is recognized when: (i) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations; (ii) the entity can identify each party s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred; (iii) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; (iv) the contract has commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing, or amount of the entity s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and (v) it is probable that the entity will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. 

We make estimates and judgments when determining whether we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. We assess the collectability of receivables based on several factors, including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of our customers. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, amounts due are recognized when collectability becomes reasonably assured, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, which is generally upon receipt of cash for transactions where collectability may have been an issue. Management s estimates regarding collectability impact the actual revenue recognized each period and the timing of the recognition of revenue. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future collectability could differ from actual events and thus materially impact our financial position and results of operations. 

Depending on the complexity of the underlying revenue arrangement and related terms and conditions, significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required to determine each parties rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, each parties performance obligations, whether performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time, estimates of completion methodologies, the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, whether we are a principal or agent in the arrangement and the appropriate period or periods in which, or during which, the completion of the earnings process and transfer of control occurs. Depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements, if different judgments, assumptions and estimates are made regarding revenue arrangements in any specific period, our periodic financial results may be materially affected. 

Relaxed Ongoing Reporting Requirements 

Upon the completion of our initial public offering, we elected to report as an emerging growth company (as defined in the JOBS Act) under the reporting rules set forth under the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other Exchange Act reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies, including but not limited to: 

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

taking advantage of extensions of time to comply with certain new or revised financial accounting standards; 

being permitted to comply with reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and 

being exempt from the requirement to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

We are subject to ongoing public reporting requirements that are less rigorous than Exchange Act rules for companies that are not emerging growth companies, and our stockholders could receive less information than they might expect to receive from more mature public companies. 

We expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of any June 30 before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 

In the ordinary course of our business, we are not currently exposed to market risk of the sort that may arise from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, or that may otherwise arise from transactions in derivatives. 

ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, related to the accounting for the triggering of a down round feature related to preferred stock, in connection with the preparation of our consolidated interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Subsequently, we executed our remediation plan for such material weakness, as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, by, among other things, ensuring that financial statement preparation checklists utilized by the Company to identify non-standard and complex transactions disclosure requirements are completed and reviewed by resources with requisite knowledge in a timely manner for interim financial reporting purposes, to improve disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in these complex non-standard technical areas. As a result, we believe that the material weakness described above was remediated as of May 15, 2024, the filing date of our first quarter 2024 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, other than completion of the actions taken to remediate the material weakness which existed as of December 31, 2023, as described above.

In addition to the foregoing agreement to indemnify and reimburse, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses whatsoever (or actions or proceedings or investigations in respect thereof), joint or several (which shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, include, but not be limited to, all reasonable costs of defense and investigation and all reasonable attorneys fees, including appeals) to which any Indemnitee may become subject insofar as such costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon the claim of any person or entity that he or it is entitled to broker s or finder s fees from any Indemnitee in connection with the Offering, other than fees due to the Placement Agent.

23

(b) Aegis will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors, and each person, if any, who controls such entity within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against, and pay or reimburse any such person for, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses whatsoever (or actions, proceedings or investigations in respect thereof) to which the Company or any such person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, whether such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses shall result from any claim of the Company or by any third party, but only to the extent that such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are finally judicially determined to have resulted primarily from or as a result of (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Offering Materials made in reliance upon and in conformity with information contained in the Offering Materials relating to the Placement Agent, or an omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in either case, if made or omitted in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Placement Agent, specifically for use in the Offering Materials or (ii) any violations by the Placement Agent of the Act or state securities laws which does not result from a violation thereof by the Issuer, the Operating Company or any of their respective affiliates, the Placement Agent s willful misconduct or gross negligence.

The foregoing indemnity agreements are in addition to any liability which the Placement Agent may otherwise have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Placement Agent s indemnification obligation hereunder exceed the aggregate amount of the Agent Cash Fees received by the Placement Agent hereunder. 

24

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, claim, proceeding or investigation (the Action ), such indemnified party, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, will notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under this Section 8 unless the indemnifying party has been substantially prejudiced by such omission. The indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof subject to the provisions herein stated, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. The indemnified party will have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will not be at the expense of the indemnifying party if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of the Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, provided , however , that if the indemnified party shall be requested by the indemnifying party to participate in the defense thereof or shall have concluded in good faith and specifically notified the indemnifying party either that there may be specific defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or that such Action involves or could have a material adverse effect upon it with respect to matters beyond the scope of the indemnity agreements contained in this Agreement, then the counsel representing it, to the extent made necessary by such defenses, shall have the right to direct such defenses of such Action on its behalf and in such case the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel in connection with any such participation or defenses shall be paid by the indemnifying party. No settlement of any Action against an indemnified party will be made without the consent of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned in light of all factors of importance to such party, and no indemnifying party shall be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any such claim effected without such indemnifying party s consent. 

9. Contribution . To provide for just and equitable contribution, if: (i) an indemnified party makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8 hereof and it is finally determined, by a judgment, order or decree not subject to further appeal that such claims for indemnification may not be enforced, even though this Agreement expressly provides for indemnification in such case; or (ii) any indemnified or indemnifying party seeks contribution under the Act, the Exchange Act, or otherwise, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Agent Cash Fees received by the Placement Agent. The relative fault, in the case of an untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission will be determined by, among other things, whether such statement, alleged statement, omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Placement Agent, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, alleged statement, omission or alleged omission. The Company and the Placement Agent agree that it would be unjust and inequitable if the respective obligations of the Company and the Placement Agent for contribution were determined by pro rata allocation of the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses or by any other method or allocation that does not reflect the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9. No person guilty of a fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls the Placement Agent within the meaning of the Act will have the same rights to contribution as the Placement Agent, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act will have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions of this Section 9. Anything in this Section 9 to the contrary notwithstanding, no party will be liable for contribution with respect to the settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent. This Section 9 is intended to supersede, to the extent permitted by law, any right to contribution under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise available. 

25

(f) Before any termination by the Placement Agent under Section 10(a) or by the Company under Section 10(b) shall become effective, the terminating party shall give written notice to the other party of its intention to terminate the Offering, which shall set forth the specific grounds for the proposed termination (the Termination Notice ).
