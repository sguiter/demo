 ) million and million in principal balance of loans to another financial institution during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, that were accounted for as secured borrowings. As of June 30, 2023 the amortized cost of those loans recorded in loans held for investment in our balance sheet was million. of the loans were past due or on nonaccrual as of June 30, 2023 and we had charge-offs of these loans during the three or six months ended June 30, 2023. See Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings for additional information on transfers accounted for as secured borrowings. million. The fraud dated back to the origination of several loans to a customer in 2010. Management believes, on the advice of its counsel, its insurance broker and a third party forensic auditor, that the losses are recoverable under the Company s insurance policies and is working through the claims process. The Company has evaluated the effect of the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and believes the impact to prior years is immaterial to each respective period assessed. However, the Company s quantitative and qualitative assessments of the fraud losses on its projected 2023 annual earnings was expected to be material at the time the evaluation was performed as of June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Company made the decision to report the losses in the respective periods in which they were incurred in its future Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings by revising impacted periods beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of June 30, 2023. For all of its filings on and after June 30, 2023, the Company revised opening retained earnings of the earliest period presented for losses incurred in earlier periods and revised all prior periods presented in the filing for losses incurred related to the period. Accordingly, the Company has revised prior periods presented in this Form 10-Q/A to reflect the fraud losses in the respective period incurred, with any losses incurred prior to January 1, 2022 adjusted in the January 1, 2022 opening retained earnings balance as previously reported in the Company s restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The accounting matters underlying the Company s conclusion related to transfers of loans by the Company s subsidiary, Primis Bank, of approximately million (the Transferred Loans to another financial institution during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. As part of the Company s 2023 year-end reporting process in the first quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the transfer of the Transferred Loans from Primis Bank to the other financial institution did not qualify for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP and should have been accounted for as secured borrowings. The Company s management team then undertook extensive discussions with Forvis regarding the effect of the mischaracterization of the transfers on the Company s reported financial results, and ultimately determined that the Impacted Financial Statements should be restated. Additionally, during the 2023 annual independent audit of the Company by Forvis, the Company pursued a pre-clearance process with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC related accounting for the Consumer Program loan portfolio as more fully described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company received a non-objection from the SEC to the Company s accounting conclusions required to correct the prior accounting for the Consumer Program. As a result, in consultation with the Company s Audit Committee to its Board of Directors and its independent registered public accounting firm, Forvis, management determined that the corrections to the Consumer Program accounting was material to the financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, which are also being restated in this Form 10-Q/A.

Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost basis of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities and (iv) internal forecasts. As of June 30, 2023, Primis had an immaterial allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. The unrealized losses related to investment securities available-for-sale identified as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related impairment. Primis performs quantitative and qualitative analysis in this determination. As a result of the Company s analysis, none of the securities were deemed to require an allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2023 and

 1 Includes million related to loans collateralizing secured borrowings. 2 Includes million related to loans collateralizing secured borrowings. Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million and million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower s debt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual status if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.

Modifications Provided to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted, the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether the concession results in a modification that is accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan under U.S. GAAP. Although each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, loans modified as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically modified through reduction in interest rates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity.

 loans from our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio with an amortized cost basis of million, were modified for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. This modification resulted in reamortization of the balance of the notes over a 25 year period, while maintaining the original maturity dates of February and July 2027, respectively. Contractual payments for both notes, prior to modification, for the three month period would have totaled million. The modified loans had no payment delinquencies in the second quarter of 2023 and represents of our total owner occupied commercial real estate loans. An existing modification performed in the first quarter of 2023, and was comprised of loan with a million amortized cost, which will resume contractual payments in August 2023. This existing modification has had no payment delinquencies since its modification and accounts for only of our total 1-4 family residential loans. The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies certain loans by providing principal forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. If it is determined that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. At that time, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. Credit Quality Indicators Through its system of internal controls, Primis evaluates and segments loan portfolio credit quality using regulatory definitions for Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Special Mention loans are considered to be criticized. Substandard and Doubtful loans are considered to be classified. Special Mention loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position. Substandard loans may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Primis had loans classified as Doubtful at June 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022. In monitoring credit quality trends in the context of assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on loans, we monitor portfolio credit quality by the weighted-average risk grade of each class of loan.

Allowance For Credit Losses Loans The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but are not limited to (i) commercial real estate - owner occupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv) commercial, (v) agricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is necessary. For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of inputs: (i) probability of default, (ii) probability of attrition, (iii) loss given default and (iv) exposure at default. Internal data is supplemented by, but not replaced by, peer data when required, primarily to determine the probability of default input. The various pool-specific inputs may be adjusted for current macroeconomic assumptions.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures: Credit loss expense (recovery) ) Balance as of June 30, Commitments Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed expiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

 Current Economic Envir onment The U.S. economy expanded in the second quarter of 2023, with Real Gross Domestic Product growing by an annualized 2.4 . According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the rate of unemployment was relatively stable compared to year end at 3.5 in July 2023. The Federal Reserve (the Fed has now raised rates 525 bps in total since March of 2022, a pace that has not been experienced in more than 40 years. This rate level is continuing to put strong margin pressure on all banks, including Primis, as the cost of deposits is increasing while many loans are fixed due to borrowers locking in historic low rates in the past few years. Inflation, while beginning to show signs of moderating, remains higher than the Fed s long term target rate. This has resulted in the Fed continuing to raise borrowing rates in an attempt to get inflation to its 2 target rate. The path of future rate hikes by the Fed is uncertain as it indicated their rate decisions going forward will be data-dependent, which could result in additional increases in the second half of 2023. Further, on August 1, 2023, Fitch Ratings downgraded the United States of America's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating to 'AA+' from 'AAA', citing expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to 'AA' and 'AAA' rated peers over the last two decades that has manifested in repeated debt limit standoffs and last-minute resolutions. The full extent of the impact of these factors is uncertain and may have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, including the possibility of an economic recession in the near or mid-term. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Revised and Restated) Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2023 totaled 2.0 million, or 0.08 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to net income of 4.6 million, or 0.19 basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 totaled 6.4 million, or 0.26 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to 9.1 million, or 0.37 basic and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Total assets as of June 30, 2023 were 3.9 billion, an increase of 8.4 compared to December 31, 2022. Total cash and cash equivalents grew to 100.9 million, up from 77.9 million at December 31, 2022. Total loans, excluding Paycheck Protection Program PPP balances as of June 30, 2023, were 3.2 billion, an increase of 246.8 million, or 8.4 , from December 31, 2022. Total deposits were 3.3 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of 21.8 compared to December 31, 2022. Non-time deposits increased to 2.85 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of 588.3 million, or 26.0 , compared to December 31, 2022. The ratio of gross loans to deposits has declined to 95 as of June 30, 2023, from 108 at December 31, 2022. Net interest margin of 2.36 in the second quarter of 2023 was down from 3.32 in the second quarter of 2022. Allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.21 at June 30, 2023, compared to 1.17 at December 31, 2022. Recently announced cost savings initiative and structural changes to branch and digital deposit gathering is expected to reduce costs by an estimated 9.4 million per year and is expected to be fully implemented by October 2023. Reduction in branch count will push total deposits per branch to approximately 153 million compared to approximately 85 million per branch at the end of 2022. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company discovered an employee loan fraud with total exposure of approximately 2.5 million. The Company evaluated the effect of the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and believes the impact to prior years is immaterial to each respective period assessed. Regardless, the Company has revised prior periods to reflect the fraud losses in the respective period incurred instead of recording in the current period when we discovered the fraud because the losses were projected to have a material impact to the expected 2023 annual results at the time of the original assessment. Additional details are included in the Retained Earnings Revisions section of Note 1 Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q/A.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Revised and Restated) Net Income Three-Month Comparison. Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2023 totaled 2.0 million, or 0.08 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to net income of 4.6 million, or 0.19 basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The 143 decrease in net income during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was driven by higher noninterest expenses mainly from an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in the second quarter of 2023 related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage and Panacea. The decrease in net income was also attributable to higher data processing expense driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during 2023. We also experienced a 3.9 million increase in the provision for loan losses, a substantial amount of which was due to specific loans that are in the process of resolution and the remaining was driven by provisions on the Consumer Program portfolio. These decreases were partially offset by higher mortgage banking income and Consumer Program derivative income in the second quarter of 2023. Six-Month Comparison. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 totaled 6.4 million, or 0.26 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to 9.1 million, or 0.37 basic and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The 30 decrease in net income during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by higher noninterest expenses from an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense, higher data processing expense in the current year, and higher provision for credit losses. These expense increases were partially offset by higher mortgage banking and Consumer Program derivative income in 2023. Net Interest Income Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Three-Month Comparison. Net interest income was 23.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 24.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Primis net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was 2.36 , compared to 3.32 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net interest margin for three months ended June 30, 2023 was affected by excess cash balances that were not earning the higher rates of our loans combined with the climbing rates of our interest bearing deposits. Total income on interest-earning assets was 50.2 million and 28.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.07 and 3.82 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by higher rates on cash and loans in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 265 basis points to 3.10 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 0.45 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Interest and fees on loans totaled 41.5 million and 26.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, while average loans during the three months ended June 30, 2023 were 3.2 billion, compared to 2.5 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2022.

 Six-Month Comparison. Net interest income was 48.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 47.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Primis net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was 2.57 , compared to 3.13 for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Continued upward pressure on deposit account rates and consumer preferences shifting from non-interest bearing to higher rate products are impacting interest expense and net interest income for the Company and the industry as a whole. Net interest margin for the Company was further affected by excess cash balances, that are part of average other earning assets that earned lower rates compared to the rates earned by our loan portfolio. Total income on interest-earning assets was 94.4 million and 54.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.00 and 3.62 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by higher rates on cash and loans in 2023 compared to 2022. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 231 basis points to 2.75 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 0.44 for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Interest and fees on loans totaled 79.9 million and 51.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, while average loans during the six months ended June 30, 2023 were 3.1 billion, compared to 2.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022.

 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses is a current charge to earnings made in order to adjust the allowance for credit losses for current expected losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending, historical loan experience and other known internal and external factors affecting loan collectability. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by considering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management s judgment. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 of 4.3 million and 9.6 million, respectively, compared to a provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 of 0.4 million and 0.5 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, 1.3 million and 6.1 million, respectively, were due to charge-offs and additional reserve calculated in our normal reserve process for the Consumer Program portfolio. Excluding this provision amount, the provision for credit losses would have been 3.1 million and 3.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. We had charge-offs totaling 1.7

 million and 0.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 6.2 million and 0.2 million during six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were recoveries totaling 0.1 million and 0.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 0.6 million and 0.7 million during six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Consumer Program charge-offs were 1.5 million and 3.5 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and were 22 thousand and 122 thousand during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. A majority of the remaining charge-offs during the three and six months ended 2023 were due to three specific borrowers in which we determined portions of their loans were uncollectible. The Financial Condition Section of this MD A provides information on our loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest Income The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Three Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 1,457 1,442 15 Income from bank-owned life insurance 394 378 16 Mortgage banking income 5,198 593 4,605 Consumer Program derivative 1,758 (238) 1,996 Other noninterest income 130 217 (87) Total noninterest income 8,937 2,392 6,545 Noninterest income increased 274 to 8.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 2.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to 4.6 million of mortgage banking income and 2.0 million of Consumer Program derivative income in the second quarter of 2023.The mortgage banking income increase was due to a full quarter of activity in 2023 compared to only a month in the same period in 2022 after acquisition in May of 2022. The Consumer Program derivative income was comprised of 0.6 million of fair value adjustment gains and 1.2 million of income related to waived interest and credit loss reimbursements from the derivative counterparty under the Consumer Program agreement. The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Six Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 2,681 2,793 (112) Income from bank-owned life insurance 814 753 61 Mortgage banking income 9,513 593 8,920 Gain on sale of loans 51 51 Consumer Program derivative 13,201 (184) 13,385 Other noninterest income 347 581 (234) Total noninterest income 26,607 4,536 22,071

 Noninterest income increased 486 to 26.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 4.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to 13.4 million of Consumer Program derivative income and 8.9 million of higher mortgage banking income during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the mortgage banking income is related to the purchase of Primis Mortgage in May 2022 coupled with meaningful growth in the year since the purchase. Mortgage banking income includes fair value adjustments, origination income, and gains on sales of mortgage loans held for sale. The increase in the Consumer Program derivative was driven by 11.1 million in fair value adjustment gains on the derivative asset and 2.2 million of income related to waived interest and credit loss reimbursements from the derivative counterparty under the Consumer Program agreement. Noninterest Expense The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Three Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Salaries and benefits 15,283 10,573 4,710 Occupancy expenses 1,593 1,418 175 Furniture and equipment expenses 1,852 1,128 724 Amortization of core deposit intangible 318 341 (23) Virginia franchise tax expense 848 814 34 Data processing expense 2,828 1,293 1,535 Marketing expense 521 731 (210) Telephone and communication expense 416 366 50 Net loss on bank premises and equipment 620 (620) Professional fees 1,075 827 248 Miscellaneous lending expenses 568 104 464 Fraud losses 1,997 57 1,940 Other operating expenses 3,140 2,251 889 Total noninterest expenses 30,439 20,523 9,916 Noninterest expenses were 30.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 20.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The 48 increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to a 4.7 million increase in employee compensation in the second quarter of 2023 related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage and Panacea compared to the second quarter of 2022, along with costs related to the cost savings initiative announced in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2023 was also attributable to a 1.5 million increase in data processing expense driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during 2023. We also experienced an increase of 1.9 million in fraud losses during the second quarter of 2023 primarily related to a substantial increase in deposit account fraud, which was also seen across the industry during the quarter. Furniture and equipment expenses increased 0.7 million due in large part to write-downs of assets related to the cost savings initiative announced in the second quarter of 2023. A significant driver of the increase in other non-interest expenses were higher expenses related to Primis Mortgage in the second quarter of 2023. Other notable drivers of the increase in other operating expenses in the second quarter of 2023 included higher FDIC insurance costs due to the significant growth in deposits.

The 45 increase in noninterest expenses was primarily attributable to a 10.1 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense mainly related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage and Panacea in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in noninterest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was also driven by a 2.3 million increase in data processing expense in 2023 driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during the first and second quarter of 2023. We also experienced an increase of 2.3 million in fraud losses during the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily related to a substantial increase in deposit account fraud in the second quarter, which was also seen across the industry. Furniture and equipment expenses increased 1.2 million due to growth in the Bank, Primis Mortgage, and Panacea, and also due to write-downs of assets related to the cost savings initiative announced in the second quarter of 2023. Other expenses increased during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, largely driven by higher expenses related to Primis Mortgage and higher FDIC insurance costs in 2023. FINANCIAL CONDITION (Revised and Restated) Balance Sheet Overview Total assets were 3.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 3.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. Total cash and cash equivalents were 100.9 million as of June 30, 2023 and 77.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Investment securities decreased from 249.8 million as of December 31, 2022 to 235.5 million as of June 30, 2023. Total loans increased 8 , from 2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 to 3.2 billion at June 30, 2023. Total deposits were 3.3 billion at June 30, 2023, compared to 2.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and total equity was 390.4 million and 389.0 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Stockholder s equity increased 1.5 million from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in retained earnings driven by net income during the year partially offset by payment of common stock dividends and an increase in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s available-for-sale securities portfolio due to increases in market interest rates during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The Company has the intention to hold these securities until maturity or recovery of the value and does not anticipate realizing any losses on the investments.

Asset Quality While the impact of COVID-19 largely subsided in 2023, the residual effect of COVID-19 and its variants, as well as new risks emerging from geopolitical conflict, inflation, bank failures and the threat of a recession continue to cause 

 53 

Table of Contents 
 economic instability. Despite this economic uncertainty, our asset quality remained strong during the first and second quarter of 2023. We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections. We maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure occurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio management practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the value of the real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy in our market area, rising interest rates, historically high inflation, and recessionary concerns. Total calculated reserves increased by 4.0 million to 38.5 million at the end of June 30, 2023 compared to 34.5 million at December 31, 2022, driven by growth in the Consumer Program loan portfolio and secondarily due to the 244.4 million in overall loan growth experienced in 2023. The following table presents a comparison of nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 

June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Nonaccrual loans 25,290 35,484 Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest 1,714 3,361 Total nonperforming assets 27,004 38,845 SBA guaranteed amounts included in nonperforming loans 2,331 3,969 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 1.21 1.17 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 152.40 97.35 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 142.73 88.93 Nonaccrual to total loans 0.80 1.20 Nonperforming assets excluding SBA guaranteed loans to total assets 0.64 0.98 Nonaccrual loans decreased 29 to 25.3 million (excluding 0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at June 30, 2023, compared to 35.5 million (excluding 0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at December 31, 2022. A substantial portion of the Bank s nonperforming assets in previous periods were comprised of two relationships with a combined balance of approximately 27.0 million. A large residential property with a balance of approximately 8.0 million included in that total was sold in the second quarter of 2023. The other relationship, primarily consisting of assisted living facilities, is currently at the end of a receiver-managed marketing process with all three facilities under contract to close in the third quarter of 2023. When including the receipt of funds and removal of these loans, the Bank would have had approximately 5.0 million of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2023, an 86 decrease from year end. At June 30, 2023, our total substandard loans were 33.7 million compared to 41.0 million at December 31, 2022, an 18 decline. Included in the total substandard loans were SBA guarantees of 0.8 million in both periods. Special mention loans totaled 32.4 million at June 30, 2023 and 32.3 million at December 31, 2022. For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, two loans from our owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio with an amortized cost basis of 0.4 million, were modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. This modification 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 resulted in reamortization of the balance of the notes over a 25 year period, while maintaining the original maturity date of February and July 2027. Contractual payments for both notes, prior to modification, for the three month period would have totaled 0.03 million. This newly originated financial difficulty modification had no payment delinquencies in the second quarter and represents 0.09 of our total owner occupied commercial real estate loans . An existing modification performed in the first quarter of 2023, comprised of one loan with a 0.9 million amortized cost, which will resume contractual payments in August 2023. This existing modification has had no payment delinquencies since its modification and accounts for only 0.15 of our total 1-4 family residential loans. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio provides us with required liquidity and collateral to pledge secure public deposits, certain other deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, and repurchase agreements. We classify our investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt investment securities that Primis has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Our portfolio of available-for-sale securities currently contains a material amount of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments due to increases in market interest rates since the original purchase of many of these securities. We have the intention to hold these securities until maturity or recovery of the value and do not anticipate realizing any losses on the investments. Investment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled 235.5 million at June 30, 2023, a decrease of 6 from 249.8 million at December 31, 2022, primarily due to paydowns, maturities, and calls of the investments over the past six months. The following table sets forth a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value, and held-to-maturity investment securities are reported at amortized cost (in thousands).

 Deposits and Other Borrowings Deposits The market for deposits is competitive. We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, as well as nationally through advertising and online banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending, purchasing of investment securities and for other business purposes. Total deposits increased 22 to 3.3 billion at June 30, 2023 from 2.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in deposits from year-end was primarily driven by the substantial growth in the Bank s new digital deposit platform in the first and second quarter of 2023. The majority of the growth was in savings accounts with the remainder largely in NOW accounts. Savings accounts increased 184 from 245.7 million as of December 31, 2022 to 696.8 million at June 30, 2023. NOW accounts increased 32 from 617.7 million at December 31, 2022 to 817.7 million at June 30, 2023. Our deposits are diversified in type and by underlying customer and lack significant concentrations to any type of customer (i.e. commercial, consumer, government) or industry. Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance were 1.2 billion, or 35 of total deposits, at June 30, 2023. As further discussed below in Liquidity and Funds Management we took steps during the first six months of 2023 to bolster our available sources of liquidity and as of June 30, 2023, our total available sources of liquidity exceeds total uninsured deposits by 100 million. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and in responding to the threat of disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the effect of such retention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general economy and market rates of interest. For our deposit agreements with certain customers, we hold the collateral in a segregated custodial account. We are required to maintain adequate collateral levels. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, we will pledge additional securities. We closely monitor collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained, while mitigating the potential risk of over-collateralization. Other Borrowings We use other borrowed funds to support our liquidity needs and to temporarily satisfy our funding needs from increased loan demand and for other shorter term purposes. We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and interest rates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with purchases of FHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total FHLB borrowings were 0 and 325.0 million, respectively. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was a result of the deposit growth during the first quarter of 2023 that primarily funded our loan growth and supported other funding needs and allowing us to repay our FHLB advances. As of March 31, 2023, we had 580.8 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit. Other borrowings can consist of federal funds purchased, secured borrowings due to failed loan sales, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance in repo accounts was 3.9 million and 6.4 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We had secured borrowings of 20.6 million as of June 30, 2023 related to loan transfers to another financial institution during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 that did not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale under relevant 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 accounting guidance. These borrowings reflect the cash received for transferring the loans to the other financial institution and any unamortized sale premium and are secured by approximately the same amount of loans held for investment that are recorded in our balance sheet. We retained the servicing of the loans that were transferred and accordingly receive principal and interest from the borrower as contractually required and transfer the interest to the other financial institution net of our contractually agreed upon servicing fee. The loans transferred have an average maturity of approximately ten years which will be the time over which the principal balance of the loans in our balance sheet and secured borrowings will pay down, absent borrower prepayments. For additional information on secured borrowings refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q/A. Liquidity and Funds Management The objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund commitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits are not sufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including but not limited to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and institutional certificates of deposits. In addition, we maintain federal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks, totaling 65 million, and utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers, as needed. We prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and two year basis. These projections incorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate risk analyses. At June 30, 2023, we had substantial liquidity on the balance sheet with cash and equivalents of 100.9 million versus 77.9 million at December 31, 2022 largely due to the growth in digital platform deposits described above. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had pledged callable agency securities, residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of 4.6 million and 14.2 million, respectively, to customers who require collateral for overnight repurchase agreements and deposits. The balance in repo accounts at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 3.9 million and 6.5 million, respectively. We repaid our short-term FHLB advances of 325.0 million that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and matured in the first quarter of 2023. As a result, we have all of our FHLB capacity available for future liquidity needs. At June 30, 2023, Primis Bank had lendable collateral value in the form of residential 1-4 family mortgages, HELOCs, commercial mortgage loans, and investment securities supporting borrowing capacity of approximately 580.8 million from the FHLB. In June 2023, the Bank began participating in the Federal Reserve discount window borrowing program. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had borrowing capacity of 489.6 million within the program. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP in response to recent industry disruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged collateral in the form of U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets. Borrowing capacity under the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of the collateral. At June 30, 2023, we had securities available of 138.0 million for utilization with the BTFP, with no borrowings outstanding under the program at June 30, 2023. The Bank also utilizes institutional and brokered certificates of deposit to supplement customer funding. At June 30, 2023, we had 75.0 million of brokered deposits outstanding. We had remaining brokered CD capacity under internal policy of approximately 321.0 million.

 At June 30, 2023, we had 495.4 million of unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds, not all of which will ultimately be drawn. The amount of certificate of deposit accounts maturing in less than one year was 379.6 million as of June 30, 2023, including 75.0 million of brokered CDs. Management anticipates that funding requirements for these commitments can be met in the normal course. As of June 30, 2023, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of June 30, 2023, Primis has no material commitments for capital expenditures. Capital Resources Capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp. and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of June 30, 2023, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

 (1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level. 
 Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory authorities. Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines Basel III aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had a capital conservation buffer of 4.71 at June 30, 2023, which exceeded the 2.50 minimum requirement below which the regulators may impose limits on distributions. Primis Bank s capital position is consistent with being well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA.

 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Revised and Restated) We are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability Committee ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk. We use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk, and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using assumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. The following tables are based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 100 basis points, measured in 100 basis point increments) as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All changes are within our Asset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines.

Table of Contents 
 Our interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in the net interest income NII over a range of interest rate scenarios. NII depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are within our ALM Policy guidelines at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income As of June 30, 2023 Adjusted Net Interest Income Change in Interest Rates Change in Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base (dollar amounts in thousands) Up 400 101,999 (13,566) Up 300 104,695 (10,870) Up 200 107,389 (8,176) Up 100 112,004 (3,561) Base 115,565 Down 100 117,594 2,029 Down 200 117,636 2,071 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income As of December 31, 2022 Adjusted Net Interest Income Change in Interest Rates Change in Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base (dollar amounts in thousands) Up 400 108,514 (12,447) Up 300 111,127 (9,834) Up 200 113,730 (7,231) Up 100 117,811 (3,150) Base 120,961 Down 100 122,070 1,109 Down 200 120,687 (274) Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE and NII sensitivity requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE tables and NII tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII. Sensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches. ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (Restated) (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are not 

 61 

Table of Contents 
 effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. This conclusion was reached as a result of the continued remediation of previously identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting as further described in Item 9A in the restated 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A related to complex accounting arrangements and also due to the identification of an additional material weakness related to the transfer of certain loans to another financial institution during the six months ended June 30, 2023. Management identified the additional material weakness over the Company s internal controls over financial reporting for the six months ended June 30, 2023 related to accounting determinations for transfers of financial assets including lack of a formally designed process and procedure for evaluation of loan transfers. The existing procedures did not outline the process to be taken and individuals to be involved in assessment of the proper accounting for loan transfers and were not sufficient enough to facilitate a proper conclusion on loan transfer transactions. As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Amendment. The Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023, at the reasonable assurance level, because of the material weakness in internal controls, which were disclosed in the Company's restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022 (with respect to the Consumer Program) and Current Report on Form 8-K on March 1, 2024 (with respect to the loan transfers). Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in the Form 10-Q/A, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash-flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles Remediation Plans (i) Complex accounting arrangements 
 Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over the identification of complex agreements the Company enters into and ensuring the appropriate level of review of these agreements by an individual with the requisite accounting expertise. The Company is adding additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting to require appropriate levels of accounting management review of new transactions. Additionally, the Company will seek appropriate third-party accounting expertise when it determines a transaction contains complex arrangements that management does not have sufficient expertise to assess and conclude upon. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation efforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as soon as possible. (ii) Loan transfers Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over the identification of loan transfer transactions and management review of the transactions. The Company has added additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation efforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as soon as possible. The Company s remediation efforts include: created a specific control in its quarterly financial close process to facilitate the identification of loan transfers and trigger an accounting review; created a process to assess loan transfers in accordance with applicable accounting guidance; 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 established procedures to enable the accounting assessment in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and developed criteria that facilitates the decision process for use of outside legal counsel to assist in evaluating the legal isolation requirement. 
 The Company s actions are subject to ongoing executive management review and are also subject to audit committee oversight. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate the material weakness, or if in the future, the Company identifies further material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors on a timely basis, and its condensed consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Management may determine that additional measures are required to address control deficiencies, strengthen internal control over financial reporting, or it may determine to modify the remediation measures described above. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . As a result of the acquisition of Primis Mortgage, the Company is continuously working to integrate Primis Mortgage into its internal control over financial reporting process. Except for the changes in connection with this integration of Primis Mortgage and the material weaknesses noted above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Primis and Primis Bank are from time to time a party, as both plaintiff and defendant, to various claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Bank s business, including administrative and/or legal proceedings that may include employment-related claims, as well as claims of lender liability, breach of contract, and other similar lending-related claims. While the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time, the Bank s management presently believes that such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. There are no proceedings pending, or to management s knowledge, threatened, that represent a significant risk against Primis or Primis Bank as of June 30, 2023. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS (Restated) There were no changes to the risk factors that were previously disclosed in our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for the addition of the item below. Recent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. The recent bank failures and related negative media attention have generated significant market trading volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies and, in particular, regional, as well as community banks like the Company. These developments have negatively impacted customer confidence in regional and community banks, which could prompt customers to maintain their deposits with larger financial institutions. Further, competition for deposits has increased in recent periods, and the cost of funding has similarly increased, putting pressure on our net interest margin. If we were required to sell a portion of our securities portfolio to address liquidity needs, we may incur losses, including as a result of the negative impact of rising interest rates on the value of our securities portfolio, which could negatively affect our earnings and our capital. If we were required to raise additional capital in the current environment, any such capital raise may be on unfavorable terms, thereby negatively impacting book value and profitability. While we have taken actions to improve our funding, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful or sufficient in the event of sudden liquidity needs. We also anticipate increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations and otherwise and new regulations directed towards banks of similar size to Primis Bank, designed to address the recent negative developments in the banking industry, all of which may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our profitability. Among other 

 63 

Table of Contents 
 things, there may be an increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition, the level of uninsured deposits, losses embedded in the held-to-maturity portion of our securities portfolio, contingent liquidity, CRE composition and concentration, capital position and our general oversight and internal control structures regarding the foregoing. As a result, Primis Bank could face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators and the investor community.
