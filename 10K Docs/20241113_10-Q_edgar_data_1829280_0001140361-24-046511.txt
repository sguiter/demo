On July 31, 2024, the Company was informed by one of its information vendors that effective December 31, 2024, the vendor will no longer include certain data within the
 information products it licenses to the Company. The vendor stated this was due to clarifications and updates to the licensing relationship between the vendor and one of its data suppliers. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on
 its contractual relationship with the vendor and any impact on customer performance commitments and the availability of alternate sources of comparable data. There can be no assurance that alternate sources of comparable data can be obtained, and if
 so, on terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those under its existing agreement.

On September 23, 2024, the Company was informed by one of its information vendors that it was exercising the right to terminate the agreement with the Company effective September
 25, 2024, based on restrictions imposed by the information vendor s upstream licensor. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of 542,389 included in cost of revenues during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, representing previously
 recorded charges under the contract that will not be paid. The Company continues to evaluate any impact on customer performance commitments and the availability of alternate sources of comparable data.

Effective February 10, 2023, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President and Class II member of the Board of Directors resigned. In connection with the resignation, the Company entered into a
 separation agreement providing for, among other things, (i) salary continuation for 12 months and (ii) accelerated vesting of 106,656 unvested restricted shares of the Company common stock. Separation expenses for the

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the Company has provided a non-GAAP measure, which is defined as financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The non-GAAP financial measure provided herein is earnings before interest, taxes, non-cash and other items Adjusted EBITDA ), which should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as
 an alternative for, net income or loss calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP (referred to below as net loss ).

Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as an additional measure of the Company s performance for purposes of business decision-making, including developing budgets, managing expenditures and
 evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help management identify additional trends in the Company s financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net loss.
 In addition, management may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some employees in order to evaluate the Company s performance. Management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the
 excluded items, particularly those items that are recurring in nature. In order to compensate for those limitations, management also reviews the specific items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, but included in net loss, as well as trends in
 those items contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in their analysis of the Company s results for reasons similar to those believed by management. Additionally,
 Adjusted EBITDA helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions. As more fully described below, management believes that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together
 with a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between the Company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different effective income tax rates and tax attributes, different
 capitalized asset values and/or different forms of employee compensation. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as a substitute for comparisons based on net (loss) income. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors should be aware
 that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding U.S. GAAP
 measures provided by each company under applicable SEC rules.

The following is an explanation of the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA but included in net loss from continuing operations:

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is a non-cash expense relating to capital expenditures and intangible assets arising from acquisitions that
 are expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. The Company excludes depreciation and amortization expense from Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that (i) the amount of such expenses in
 any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of the business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired
 tangible and intangible assets. Accordingly, management believes that this exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. Investors should note that the use of tangible and
 intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation and should also note that such expense will recur in future periods.

32 

Table of Contents 

Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. Management believes that
 excluding the effect of stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons in the Company s operating performance because (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific
 period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection
 with acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense includes certain separation expenses related to the vesting of stock options. Effective February 10, 2023, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President and Class II member of the Board
 of Directors resigned. In connection with the resignation, the Company entered into a separation agreement providing for, among other things, accelerated vesting of 106,656 unvested restricted shares of the Company common stock. Stock based
 compensation expense for 2023 includes 349,832 related to the accelerated vesting of stock, which is recognized in separation expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. These expenses were incurred during the three
 months ended March 31, 2023, and there were no additional related expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Management believes that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and
 investors in making meaningful comparisons between the Company s operating performance and the operating performance of other companies that may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their
 stock-based compensation. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating
 results in future periods. Investors should also note that such expenses will recur in the future.

Interest Expense. Interest expense is associated with the convertible notes entered into on September 1, 2021 in the amount of 24,000,000. The Notes are due on September 1,
 2025, and accrue interest at an annual rate of 3.5 . Management excludes interest expense from Adjusted EBITDA (i) because it is not directly attributable to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, its exclusion assists
 management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures. Investors should note that interest
 expense associated with the Notes will recur in future periods.

Interest and Investment Income. Interest and Investment income is associated with the level of marketable debt
 securities and other interest-bearing accounts in which the Company invests. Interest and investment income can vary over time due to changes in interest rates and level of investments. Management excludes interest and investment income from
 Adjusted EBITDA (i) because these items are not directly attributable to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance
 and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures. Investors should note that interest income will recur in future periods.

33 

Table of Contents 

Other Items. The Company engages in other activities and transactions that can impact net income (loss). In the periods reported, these other items included (i) change in fair
 value of warrant liability relating to warrants assumed in the acquisition of Helix; (ii) gain on sale of investment relating to the sale of a minority equity interest; and (iii) gain on debt redemption which relates to a gain on the early
 retirement of a portion of the convertible notes (for further discussion, refer to Note 10 Warrant Liability and Note 11 Convertible Notes to the financial statements). Management excludes these other items from Adjusted EBITDA because management believes these activities or transactions are not directly attributable
 to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. Investors should note that some of these other items may recur in
 future periods.

Severance expenses. Effective February 10, 2023, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President and Class II member of the Board of Directors resigned. In connection with the
 resignation, the Company entered into a separation agreement providing for, among other things, (i) salary continuation for twelve months and (ii) accelerated vesting of 106,656 unvested restricted shares of the Company common stock.
 Severance expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes 250,000 related to the salary continuation. Management excludes these other items from Adjusted EBITDA because management believes
 these costs are not recurring and not directly attributable to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. In
 addition, the Company records normal course of business severance expenses in the operating expense line item related to its employees activities.

Litigation related expenses. Management excludes litigation expenses that are extraordinary in nature and are unrelated to the Company s
 day-to-day business operations. The nature of these expenses is primarily related to direct and incremental third-party legal expenses associated with such litigation, which pertains to entities acquired in the Helix merger, see Item 3 Legal
 Proceedings and Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements for further information.

Strategic review related expenses. Management excludes certain professional expenses that are
 extraordinary in nature and are unrelated to the Company s day-to-day business operations. The nature of these expenses is primarily related to a strategic review of the Company s operations. 

Contract termination impacts. Management excludes certain expenses that are extraordinary in nature and are unrelated to the Company s day-to-day business operations. The nature
 of these expenses is primarily related to the impact of an adjustment related to the cancellation of an inbound information contract. On September 23, 2024, the Company was informed by one of its information vendors that it was exercising the
 right to terminate the agreement with the Company effective September 25, 2024, based on restrictions imposed by the information vendor s upstream licensor. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of 542,389 during the quarter ended
 September 30, 2024, representing previously recorded charges under the contract that will not be paid.

Income tax (benefit) expense. Management excludes the income tax (benefit) expense from Adjusted EBITDA (i) because management believes that the income tax (benefit) expense is
 not directly attributable to the underlying performance of business operations and, accordingly, its exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and
 investors in making comparisons to companies with different tax attributes.

Limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures

There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures
 provided by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent
 limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which items are adjusted to calculate non-GAAP financial measures. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a U.S. GAAP basis as
 well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing U.S. GAAP measures in the Company s public disclosures.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management encourages investors and others
 to review the Company s financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business and to view non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

The following table reconciles the specific items excluded from U.S. GAAP metrics in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods shown below:

 The decrease is primarily due to lower revenues and higher cost of sales, partially offset by other decreases in operating expenses discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, the Company s operations have been financed primarily from cash proceeds received from equity issuances and the issuance of the Notes. On February 10, 2023, the Company sold BioTrack
 for 30,000,000 consisting of 20,000,000 in cash at closing and twelve unconditional monthly payments aggregating 10,000,000 thereafter. On July 21, 2023, the Company sold a minority equity interest in a customer for cash proceeds of 5,805,858 and future contingent earnout payments aggregating up to 3,600,000 in 2025 and 2026. These transactions have provided additional cash and liquidity to the Company. As of September

30, 2024 , the Company s balance of cash and marketable securities aggregated 49,357,888 and outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Notes, due September 1, 2025, aggregated 24,370,509 . The Company expects to continue to fund its operations and potential future acquisitions through a combination of cash flow generated from operating activities, available cash and marketable securities,
 debt financing and/or additional equity issuances.

 ended September 30, 2024 compared to cas h provided by operating activities of 1,387,350 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .
 This primarily is the result of a gain recognized on a non-recurring sale of investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 5,725,164 decrease in the gain recognized is partially offset by
 changes in working capital accounts related to the timing of cash flows from operations.

Net Cash Used In Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of 730,177 increased by 3,091,229 for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 2,361,052 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This

is primarily the result of the impact of the reductions of sale proceeds from the sale of an investment and discontinued operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by changes in net additions to marketable securities. 

Net Cash Used In Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of 1,138,037 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 30,046 compared to cash used in financing activities of 1,107,991 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The

 increase was primarily due to the repurchase of stock offset by reductions in tax payments for vested restricted stock units and redemptions of convertible notes. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements that have prepared in
 accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that several accounting policies are important to understanding historical and future performance. The Company refers to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require the
 Company to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimates are made, and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the
 estimates and judgments. The Company bases the estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
 judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Critical accounting policies and estimates are further discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as filed with the
 SEC on March 29, 2024 . There have been no changes to these policies and estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 , Income
 Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 requires additional disclosures related to rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and other disclosures. Under ASU 2023-09,
 for each annual period presented, public entities are required to (1) disclose specific categories in the tabular rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU
 2023-09 requires all reporting entities to disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes as well as the amount of income taxes paid by individual jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective
 for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and can be applied on a prospective basis with an option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
 evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 improve
 reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update require public companies to disclose on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses
 that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. In
 addition, the amendment requires that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets currently required in interim periods and require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the
 CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU
 2023-07 on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. This amendment will go into effect for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years
 beginning after December 15, 2024. 

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 , Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation
 Disclosures Topic 220 ): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses . This guidance requires additional disclosure of certain
 amounts included in the expense captions presented on the Statement of Operations as well as disclosures about selling expenses. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with the option for retrospective application, for annual periods beginning
 after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 on its
 condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.

JOBS Act

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company. As an emerging
 growth company, the Company is electing to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards.

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, the Company is not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on its system
 of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,
 (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial
 statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median
 employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until the fifth anniversary of the business combination or until the Company no longer meet the requirements for being an emerging growth company, whichever occurs first.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
 amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer (who is also
 the Company s principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (who is also the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) under
 the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
 of September 30, 2024 , which is the end of the three-month period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The Company identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as disclosed in Item 9A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 , as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer therefore concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 remain ineffective to the extent of the material weaknesses identified.

We have implemented several processes and control procedures in 2023, including those outlined below, to remediate the deficiencies noted above and from the prior year.

We currently are assessing and improving the operating effectiveness of these controls to ensure they will operate at an acceptable level of assurance.

We implemented a new ERP system in 2023 and are currently establishing and testing appropriate logical access and other controls regarding the system. We may implement additional systems to improve
 our internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, the divestiture of BioTrack in February 2023 has resulted in a less complex control environment which, coupled with the implementation and effective operation of new entity level,
 financial reporting, treasury, accounts payable and payroll controls, has resulted in a conclusion that our previously identified material weaknesses related to (1) lack of segregation of duties over the cash, accounts payable, payroll and financial
 reporting transaction classes; and (2) evidence of formalization surrounding internal controls and the financial close process are fully remediated.

We have contracted an outside consulting firm to assist in the overall evaluation and documentation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We are
 implementing newly designed controls and testing their operating effectiveness.

We believe these actions, when complete, will remediate the control weaknesses. However, the weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient
 period of time for management to test the results for operating effectiveness. Once implemented, we intend to continue periodic testing and reporting of the internal controls to ensure continuity of compliance.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Except for the items described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule
 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. 

Legal Proceedings

From time to time we may be involved in claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. For any matters where management currently believes it is probable that we will incur a loss and that
 the probable loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we record reserves in our condensed consolidated financial statements based on our best estimates of such loss. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to either the
 probable outcome or the amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly and time consuming and it can divert management s attention from important
 business matters and initiatives, negatively impacting our overall operations. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently have any pending litigation to which we are a party or to which our
 property is subject that we believe to be material.
