Results
of Operation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company started to sell its network equipment through Zhejiang Toumi and generated revenue
of 2,059, with cost of goods sold of 1,658. The Company generated revenue of 3,178 by selling furniture, with a total cost of goods
sold of 2,872 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company has discontinued its furniture sales business in August
2024, following a management change and a shift in business strategy. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred operating expenses of 8,545 and 8,095, respectively. For the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of 8,229 and 7,846, respectively. The operating expenses
and net loss are comparable for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Results
of Operation for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated revenue of 2,059 by selling its network equipment through Zhejiang Toumi,
with cost of goods sold of 1,658. The Company generated revenue of 3,178 by selling furniture, with a total cost of goods sold of 2,872
during the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred operating expenses of 57,396 and 24,895, respectively. The increase
was attributable to increased professional fees resulting from the change of control of the Company that occurred in April 2024, compared
with the same period of last year. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of 57,057 and
 24,626, respectively. The net loss increased due to the rise in operating expenses. 

Equity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 510,108 and 453,051, respectively. As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash of 370 and working capital deficit of 52,047. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash of 8,761 and a working capital deficit
of 97,392. The reduction in the working capital deficit was primarily due to the forgiveness of loans by shareholders upon change in
control. 

Going
Concern Assessment 

The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated
deficit and other adverse key financial ratios. 

Management s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely
basis, obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and the President of the Company to eliminate inefficiencies
in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient
to fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue
as a going concern. 

13 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are
based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The
critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide
useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition.

performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that as
of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely alerting
them to material information relating to Landbay Inc. required to be included in our Exchange Act filings. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)
of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
