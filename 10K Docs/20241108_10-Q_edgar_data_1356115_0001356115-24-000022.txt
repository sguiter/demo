 This quarterly report (this "Quarterly Report") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements relating to our liquidity and capital resources, our performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Furthermore, all of the statements regarding future financial performance (including market conditions and demographics) are forward-looking statements.

 Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. 
 
 Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, liquidity or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 
 Unfavorable changes in economic conditions and their effects on the real estate industry generally and our operations and financial condition, including inflation, rising or high interest rates, tightening monetary policy or recession, which may limit our ability to access funding and generate returns for shareholders; 
 
 Our loans and investments expose us to risks similar to and associated with real estate investments generally; 
 
 Commercial real estate-related investments that are secured, directly or indirectly, by real property are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us; 
 
 Risks associated with the ownership of real estate, including dependence on tenants and compliance with laws and regulations related to ownership of real property; 
 
 Risks associated with our investment in diverse issuers, industries and investment forms and classes, both in real estate and in non-real estate sectors, including common equity, preferred equity, options or other derivatives, short sale contracts, secured loans of securities, reverse repurchase agreements, structured finance securities, below investment grade senior loans, bonds, convertible instruments, joint ventures, and emerging markets; 
 
 Fluctuations in interest rate and credit spreads, could reduce our ability to generate income on our loans and other investments, which could lead to a significant decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments; 
 
 The use of leverage to finance our investments; 
 
 Risks associated with our loans and investments in debt instruments including, senior loans, mezzanine loans, collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs"), and structured finance securities; 
 
 Our loans and investments are concentrated in terms of type of interest, geography, asset types, industry and sponsors and may continue to be so in the future;

 On July 1, 2022 (the Deregistration Date ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC issued an order pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act declaring that the Company has ceased to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act (the Deregistration Order ). The issuance of the Deregistration Order enabled the Company to proceed with full implementation of its new business mandate to operate as a diversified REIT that focuses primarily on investing in various commercial real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to equity, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity (the Business Change ). 
 The Company is externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors X, L.P. (the Adviser ), through an agreement dated July 1, 2022, amended on October 25, 2022, April 11, 2023 and July 22, 2024 (the Advisory Agreement ), by and among the Company and the Adviser for an initial term that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. The Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of the Company and provides investment management services. The Company had no employees as of September 30, 2024 . All of the Company s investment decisions are made by the Adviser, subject to general oversight by the Adviser s investment committee and our board of trustees (the Board ). The Adviser is wholly owned by NexPoint Advisors, L.P. (the Sponsor or NexPoint ). 
 As a diversified REIT, the Company s primary investment objective is to provide both current income and capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve this objective through the Business Change. Target underlying property types primarily include, but are not limited to, single-family rentals, multifamily, self-storage, life science, office, industrial, hospitality, net lease and retail. The Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities.

 units of NexPoint Hospitality Trust NHT (the NHT Units to NREP. The Purchase Agreement was funded in part by cash of million provided to NREP by the Company that was allocated for the sale of the NHT Units. Then on April 19, 2024, the Company, NexPoint Real Estate Opportunities, LLC ("NREO"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and NREP entered into an Assignment of Interests Agreement whereby NREP distributed, assigned, conveyed, transferred, set over, and delivered to NREO its right to purchase the NHT Units under the Purchase Agreement and all of its rights, title and interest in, to and under the NHT Units, including all voting, consent and financial rights, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances (the NHT Acquisition ). As a result, the Company owned of the outstanding NHT Units and was determined to hold the controlling financial interest in NHT and as a result consolidated NHT. The NHT Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations . 
 Because the Company does not wholly own NHT, the Company recognized a noncontrolling interest NCI of million, which was recorded at fair value when the controlling financial interest was acquired. The Company also recorded an unrealized gain on its previously held interest in NHT of million.

 The Company s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual current and deferred effective tax rates, adjusted for discrete items. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were ) and ) , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were ) and ) , respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to our REIT operations generally not being subject to federal income taxes. 
 The Company recognizes its tax positions and evaluates them using a two-step process. First, the Company determines whether a tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, the Company will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 The Company had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2023, 2022 and 2021 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject. When applicable, the Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on its Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 million of the NHT segment's floating rate mortgage and mezzanine indebtedness at a weighted average rate of . 
 To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, the NHT segment incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the NHT segment s own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the NHT segment s derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the NHT segment and its counterparties. The Company has determined that the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to the NHT segment's derivative contracts, which determination was based on the fair value of each individual contract, was not significant to the overall valuation. Additionally, in the case of interest rate caps, the NHT segment has no performance obligation, so no credit valuation adjustment is necessary. As a result, all of the NHT segment s derivatives held as of September 30, 2024 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Changes in fair value of the interest rate caps are recorded directly as interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, NHT recorded ) million, and million, respectively, in interest expense related to changes in the fair value of interest rate caps.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included herein and with our 2023 Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this report and "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Portfolio consisted primarily of debt and equity investments in the single-family rental, self-storage, office, hospitality, life science and multifamily sectors. The company has two reportable segments, NXDT and NHT. NXDT represents the Company's primary reportable segment and represents a significant majority of the Company's consolidated portfolio (the "NXDT Portfolio"). The NXDT reportable segment is the legacy reportable segment and is focused on investing in various commercial real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to, equity, mortgage, debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity. The NHT reportable segment represents a minority of the Company's consolidated portfolio (the "NHT Portfolio") and operations and is focused on acquiring additional U.S. located hospitality assets that meet its investment objectives and criteria and seeking to own, renovate and operate its existing portfolio of income-producing hotel properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP. The OP GP is the sole general partner of the OP and is owned 100 by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, there were 2,000 OP Units outstanding, of which 100 were owned by us. 
 On July 1, 2022, or the Deregistration Date, the SEC issued an order pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act declaring that the Company has ceased to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act (the "Deregistration Order"). The issuance of the Deregistration Order enabled the Company to proceed with full implementation of its new business mandate to operate as a diversified REIT that focuses primarily on investing in various commercial real estate property types and across the capital structure, including but not limited to, equity, mortgage, debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity (the "Business Change"). 
 As a diversified REIT, the Company s primary investment objective is to provide both current income and capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve this objective through the Business Change. Target underlying property types primarily include, but are not limited to, single-family rentals, multifamily, self-storage, life science, office, industrial, hospitality, net lease and retail. The Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities. We are externally managed by the Adviser through the Advisory Agreement, by and among the Company and the Adviser. The Advisory Agreement was dated July 1, 2022, and amended on October 25, 2022, April 11, 2023 and July 22, 2024, for an initial three-year term that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. The Adviser is wholly owned by our Sponsor. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through one or more TRS entities and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. 
 The high rate environment and ongoing economic uncertainty, has limited credit availability to commercial real estate. Less available and more expensive debt capital has had pronounced effects on the capital markets, making property acquisitions and other investments harder to finance. Similar factors also impact the timing of and proceeds generated from asset sales and our ability to obtain debt capital. 
 On October 15, 2021, Marc S. Kirschner, as litigation trustee of a litigation subtrust formed in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of Highland, a former affiliate of our Sponsor, filed a lawsuit (the "Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit") against various persons and entities, including our Sponsor and James Dondero. On March 24, 2023, the litigation trustee 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 filed a motion for leave to stay the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit, which was granted by the bankruptcy court on April 4, 2023. Per the court s order, the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit is stayed until any party provides 30 days notice of the intent to resume the adversary proceeding, with all pending deadlines extended for a period of time commensurate with the length of the stay. As of the date of this filing, the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit continues to be stayed. In addition, on February 8, 2023, UBS Securities and its affiliate (collectively UBS filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York against Mr. Dondero and a number of entities currently or previously affiliated with Mr. Dondero, seeking to collect on 1.3 billion in judgments UBS obtained against entities that were managed indirectly by Highland (the "UBS Lawsuit"). Neither the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit nor the UBS Lawsuit include claims related to our business or our assets. Our Sponsor and Mr. Dondero have informed us they believe the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit has no merit and Mr. Dondero has informed us he believes the UBS Lawsuit has no merit; we have been advised that the defendants named in each of the lawsuits intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We do not expect the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit or the UBS Lawsuit will have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Macroeconomic trends, including increases in or high inflation and rising or high interest rates, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inflation could have an adverse impact on our operating expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental and other revenue. There is no guarantee we will be able to mitigate the impact of rising or high inflation. In response to high inflation, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to combat inflation and restore price stability. In addition, to the extent our exposure to increases in or high interest rates on any of our debt is not eliminated through interest rate swaps and interest rate protection agreements, such increases or elevated rates will result in higher debt service costs which will adversely affect our cash flows. We cannot make assurances that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. Such future constraints could increase our borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments, which could slow or deter future growth.

 Other income. Other income was approximately 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 1.2 million. The increase between the periods was attributed to the NHT consolidation. 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses were 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 9.1 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the NHT consolidation. 
 Property management fees. Property management fees were 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 0.4 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the NHT consolidation. 
 Real estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 0.6 million. Real estate taxes and insurance expenses consist primarily of expenses from our investment in Cityplace Tower. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the consolidation of NHT. 
 Advisory and administrative fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred administrative fees and advisory fees of 10.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred administrative fees and advisory fees of 8.7 million, inclusive of 2.0 million in expenses that were waived and cannot be recouped by the Adviser. The Expense Cap expired on June 30, 2023. The increase between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributed to the addition of fees paid to the NHT Adviser pursuant to the NHT Advisory Agreement from the NHT Acquisition and the expiration of the Expense Cap. 
 Property general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 2.3 million. The increase between the periods is primarily attributed to the NHT consolidation. 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 3.4 million. The increase between periods was primarily due to an increase in accounting and audit fees. 
 Conversion expenses. Conversion expenses were 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 1.4 million.

 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 0.5 million . Due to the Business Change, the fair value of our real estate properties as of July 1, 2022 became the new cost basis for the Company. This change reset the depreciable basis of our properties as well as caused the recognition of new intangible lease assets. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the NHT consolidation. 
 Impairment loss. Impairment loss was 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 6.1 million. The increase between the periods was due to an increase in impairment charges relating to Plano Homewood Suites and Las Colinas Homewood Suites. 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 20.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 9.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the NHT consolidation.

 Equity in income (losses) of unconsolidated ventures . Equity in losses of unconsolidated ventures was (0.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately (0.6) million. The decrease between periods was primarily due to a decrease in net income at Marriot Uptown. 
 Income tax expense (benefit) . The Company has recorded income tax expense (benefit) of (1.6) million associated with the TRSs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.4 million associated with the TRSs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is partially offset by the annual change in valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset of 0.2 million for a net expense of 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
 Change in unrealized gains (losses) . Unrealized gains (losses) from our investments accounted for at fair value was 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (89.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 91.8 million . The gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were largely driven by redemptions of the legacy CLO positions, which generated realized losses and a positive change in unrealized, mark-to-market gains on NSP common equity of 5.3 million, VB OP Units of 2.4 million, offset by mark-to-market losses on IQHQ LP interests of 22.2 million. The losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on common units of NSP common equity of 34.2 million, mark-to-market losses on NHT common stock of 18.8 million, and losses on VB OP Units of 26.1 million. 
 Realized gains (losses) . Realized gains (losses) were (21.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (0.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately (21.2) million. The losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by realized losses on the legacy CLOs of 22.8 million. The losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by realized losses on the sale of equities of 1.3 million. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measurements 
 Consolidated Net Operating Income and Same Store Net Operating Income 
 Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties between segments and to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) to add back (1) interest expense, (2) advisory fees and administrative fees, (3) the impact of depreciation and amortization, (4) corporate general and administrative expenses, (5) income tax expenses, (6) conversion expenses, (7) non-operating property investment revenue, (8) realized and change in unrealized gains (losses) generated from non-real estate investments, (9) equity in income (losses) of unconsolidated equity method ventures, and (10) impairment loss. 
 The cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital, which may have changed or may change in the future. Corporate general and administrative expenses, advisory fees and administrative fees, conversion expenses, and income tax expenses are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property. Depreciation and amortization expenses and impairment loss are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Equity in income (losses) of unconsolidated equity method ventures are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the properties. Non-operating property investment revenue and realized and change in unrealized gains (losses) from non-real estate investments are eliminated as they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the properties. We believe that eliminating these items from net income (loss) is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, interest expense, advisory fees and administrative fees, conversion expenses, income tax expenses, depreciation and amortization 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 expense, non-operating property investment revenue and realized and change in unrealized gains and losses generated from non-real estate investments, equity in income or losses of unconsolidated equity method ventures, and impairment loss, all of which may be material values. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income, which further limits its usefulness. 
 NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in Results of Operations regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. 
 Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do. 
 We define Same Store NOI as NOI for our properties that are comparable between periods and that are stabilized. Please see below for a discussion of properties included as Same Store (defined below). We view Same Store NOI as an important measure of the operating performance of our properties because it allows us to compare operating results of properties owned for the entirety of the current and comparable periods and therefore eliminates variations caused by acquisitions or dispositions from the beginning of the compared period to the end of the current period.

 Consolidated Same Store Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Same Store properties were approximately 55.2 leased with a weighted average monthly effective occupied rent per square foot of 1.16, compared to 75.7 leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per square foot of 1.21 as of September 30, 2023. For our Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Revenues 
 Rental Income . Rental income was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses . Property operating expenses were 126.2 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 84.8 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 41.4 thousand or 48.8 . The majority of the increase between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is related to an increase in repair and maintenance fees. 
 Real estate taxes and insurance . Real estate taxes and insurance costs were 211.3 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 223.3 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 12.0 thousand or 5.4 . The majority of the decrease between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is related to a decrease in the property tax budget. 
 Property management fees . Property management fees were 57.8 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 55.3 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 2.5 thousand, or 5.5 . The increase between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is related to an increase in rental revenue, which the management fee is calculated off of. 
 Property general and administrative expenses . Property general and administrative expenses were 55.0 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52.8 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 2.2 thousand, or 3.8 . The majority of the increase between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is related to an increase in professional fees. 
 Consolidated FFO and AFFO 
 We believe that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations FFO ), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT and adjusted funds from operations AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. 
 Since the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income (loss), as defined by GAAP. We compute FFO attributable to common shareholders as net income (loss), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, plus impairment losses and realized gains (losses). Our calculation of FFO differs slightly from NAREIT's definition of FFO because we exclude realized gains (losses). We believe the exclusion of realized gains (losses) is appropriate because these realized gains (losses) are not related to our real estate properties. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) before adjusting for amounts attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in NHT and we show the combined amounts attributable to such non-controlling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common shareholders. 
 AFFO makes certain adjustments to FFO in order to arrive at a more refined measure of the operating performance of our Portfolio. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. AFFO adjusts FFO to remove items such as equity based compensation expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 in connection with obtaining long-term debt financing, non-controlling interests (as described above) related to these items, and change in unrealized gains (losses). We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities. 
 We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than we do. 
 The following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

 The three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 FFO was (1.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (63.2) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 61.5 million. The change in our FFO between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to the redemptions of the CLO positions, which reclassified the change in unrealized to realized gains (losses) of approximately 22.8 million. 
 AFFO was (1.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (2.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 0.7 million. The change in our AFFO between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates an increase in revenue from the NHT consolidation. 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 FFO was (3.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (89.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 86.0 million. The change in our FFO between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to the redemptions of the CLO positions, which reclassified the change in unrealized to realized gains (losses) of approximately 22.8 million. 
 AFFO was (7.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (3.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately (4.7) million. The change in our AFFO between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to the redemptions of the CLO positions, which reclassified the change in unrealized to realized gains (losses) of approximately 22.8 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for debt maturities, operating expenses and other expenditures including: 
 capital expenditures to continue the ongoing development of Cityplace Tower; 
 capital expenditures necessary to maintain the NHT hotel properties; 
 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see Obligations and Commitments below); 
 recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our properties; 
 distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT; 
 income taxes for taxable income generated by TRS entities; 
 acquisition of additional properties or investments; 
 advisory and administrative fees payable to our Adviser; 
 general and administrative expenses; 
 reimbursements to our Adviser; and 
 property management fees. 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through our investment income, existing cash balance and, if necessary, future debt or equity issuances. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 8.5 million of cash available to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of September 30, 2024 , we also had 34.9 million of restricted cash held 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 in reserve by the lender on the Cityplace debt. These reserves include escrows for property taxes and insurance, reserves for tenant improvements as well as required excess collateral. As of September 30, 2024 , we also had 0.5 million of restricted cash held in reserve by the lender on the NexBank Revolver. These reserves are to be used for future interest payments on the debt facility. As of September 30, 2024, we also had 9.3 million of restricted cash reserves associated with the NHT segment for brand-mandated Performance Improvement Plan PIPs and furniture, fixtures and equipment upgrades arising from the execution of the Company s franchise agreement and future insurance and property tax expenses. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional properties, make additional accretive investments pursuant to our investment strategy, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings, and property and non-real estate asset dispositions. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity, market perceptions about us and restrictions on sales of properties under the Code. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources. 
 In addition to our ongoing renovation of Cityplace, our other properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. We estimate an additional 190 million to 210 million of capital expenditures to complete the Cityplace renovation. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments, or expansions of our properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents selected data from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (7,550) (18,474) Net cash provided by investing activities 18,460 15,991 Net cash used in financing activities (10,839) (8,332) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 71 (10,815) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 53,169 48,649 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 53,240 37,834 
 Cash flows from operating activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was (7.6) million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of (18.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly attributable to a decrease in income taxes payable, life settlement premiums and accounts payable. 
 Cash flows from investing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 18.5 million, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 16.0 million for the nine 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to the net cash acquired from the NHT Acquisition during the period. 
 Cash flows from financing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was (10.8) million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of (8.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from financing activities was due to a decrease in proceeds received from credit facilities, which was partially offset by a decrease in cash payments for dividends to common shareholders. 
 
 Debt 
 Mortgage Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated subsidiaries had aggregate mortgage debt outstanding to third parties of approximately 140.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of 8.28 . See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 We intend to invest in additional real estate investments as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common shares or other securities or investment and property dispositions. 
 Although we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common shares or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. 
 Furthermore, following the completion of our renovation and development programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels. 
 Cityplace Debt 
 On May 8, 2023, we received lender consent to defer the maturity of the Cityplace debt to September 8, 2023. Also on May 8, 2023, the parties to the loan agreement agreed to convert the index upon which the interest rate is based to one-month SOFR effective as of the first interest period beginning on or after May 8, 2023. On September 8, 2023, the lender agreed to defer the maturity of the Cityplace debt by six months to March 8, 2024. On March 8, 2024, the lender agreed to defer the maturity of the Cityplace debt by twelve months to March 8, 2025. The purpose of the deferral was to allow for continued discussions around refinancing the debt. Management recognizes that finding an alternative source of funding is necessary to repay the debt by the maturity date. Management believes that there is sufficient time before the maturity date and that the Company has sufficient access to capital to ensure the Company is able to meet its obligations as they become due. 
 Credit Facility 
 On January 8, 2021, the Company entered into a 30.0 million credit facility ("Credit Facility") with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and drew the full balance. On October 20, 2023, Raymond James Bank, N.A. agreed to amend the terms of the Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the maturity date to October 6, 2025 and increased the credit limit to 20 million. On October 23, 2023, the Company drew 6.0 million of the available balance. On November 20, 2023, the Company drew the remaining 13.0 million of the available balance. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Facility bore interest at the one-month SOFR plus 4.25 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid down 6.0 million on the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of 14.0 million. For additional information regarding our Credit Facility, see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 The Credit Facility will mature on October 7, 2025 and is subject to monthly amortization payments through the maturity date. We believe we will have adequate liquidity to pay these obligations when they come due.

 The PC B Loan and the Note A Loan and Note B Loan contain customary representations, warranties, and events of default, which require NHT to comply with affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 30, 2024, NHT is in compliance with all debt covenants. 
 The NHT OP also entered into several convertible notes with affiliates of the NHT Adviser since January 8, 2019. The fixed rate notes have rates ranging from 1.82 to 7.50 (which were market interest rates at the time of their issuance) while outstanding and mature in 20 years from their date of issuance. As of September 30, 2024, the net carrying amount of the convertible notes due to affiliates of the NHT Adviser was 50.2 million.

 Income Taxes 
 I. Canadian mutual fund status 
 NHT is a mutual fund trust pursuant to the Tax Act. Under current tax legislation, a mutual fund trust that is not a SIFT pursuant to the Tax Act is entitled to deduct distributions of taxable income such that it is not liable to pay Canadian income taxes provided that its taxable income is fully distributed to unitholders. NHT intends to qualify as a mutual fund trust that is not a SIFT and to make distributions not less than the amount necessary to ensure that NHT will not be liable to pay Canadian income taxes. 
 II. U.S REIT Status 
 We anticipate that we will continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. However, we can give no assurance that we will maintain REIT qualification. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable income , as defined by the Code, to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. The Company has recorded a current income tax expense of 1.0 million associated with the TRSs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is largely driven by income from the Company s legacy CLO investments and investments in debt instruments not secured by mortgages on real property. The tax expense is decreased by the annual change in valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset of 0.2 million for a net expense of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, that is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
 If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income (loss) and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain 
 72 

Table of Contents 

 Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable REIT requirements. 
 We evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. As of September 30, 2024 and to our knowledge, we have no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time. 
 We recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 We had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of September 30, 2024. We and our subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which our subsidiaries and we are subject. When applicable, we recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 
 Dividends 
 We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common shares. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common shares out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities. 
 We will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per common share, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, investments held through our TRSs, book/tax differences on income derived from partnerships, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared a dividend on our common shares of 0.15 per share which was paid on September 30, 2024 to shareholders of record on August 15, 2024. Our Board declared a dividend on our Series A Preferred Shares of 0.34375 per share which was paid on September 30, 2024, to shareholders of record on September 23, 2024. We expect that dividends on our common shares, when, if and as declared by our Board, will be declared on a quarterly basis. 
 The purpose of paying the elective stock dividend partially in shares and partially in cash is to conserve cash for additional investments at the Company. The Company may revert to paying the dividend solely in cash at some point in the future when cash flow from operations supports such a cash dividend. However, there can be no assurance that cash flow from operations will be able to support a cash dividend in the future. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had the following off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. 
 See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , for further discussion of our accounting estimates and policies. 
 Valuation of Level 3 Fair Valued Investments 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 42.0 of the total assets owned by the Company are comprised of fair valued level 3 investments. The Company elected the fair-value option in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 825-10-10. On an annual basis, the Company hires independent third-party valuation firms to provide updated fair values for subsequent measurement absent a readily available market price. The valuation is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, Fair Value of Derivatives and Financial Instruments , for further discussion of our valuation techniques of level 3 investments. The necessary inputs for these valuations includes a variety of valuation techniques and unobservable inputs. These inputs are subject to assumptions and estimates. As a result, the determination of fair value is uncertain because it involves subjective judgments and estimates that are unobservable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the unrealized gains (loss) related to the change in fair value of level 3 investments 
 74 

Table of Contents 

 is (16.4) million and 2.2 million, respectively. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding the valuation of level 3 fair valued investments. 
 Purchase Price Allocation 
 Upon acquisition of a property considered to be an asset acquisition, the purchase price and related acquisition costs total consideration are allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets based on relative fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. Acquisition costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 805. 
 The allocation of total consideration, which is determined using inputs that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established by FASB ASC 820 (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements), is based on management s estimate of the property s as-if vacant fair value and is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. If any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value, which is estimated using inputs that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. 
 Impairment 
 Real estate assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The key inputs into our impairment analysis include, but are not limited to, the holding period, net operating income, and capitalization rates. In such cases, we will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value. The Company s impairment analysis identifies and evaluates events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of a real estate investment may not be recoverable, including determining the period the Company will hold the rental property, net operating income, and the estimated capitalization rate for each respective real estate investment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded approximately 1.0 million of impairment charges on real estate assets held and used, which are included in Impairment loss on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company did not record any impairment charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Held for Sale 
 The Company periodically classifies real estate assets as held for sale when certain criteria are met in accordance with U.S. GAAP. At that time, the Company presents the net real estate assets and the liabilities associated with the real estate held for sale separately in its consolidated balance sheet, and the Company ceases recording depreciation and amortization expense related to that property. Real estate held for sale is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were one and zero properties classified as held for sale, respectively. In addition to the net real estate assets, the consolidated balance sheets also includes approximately 0.05 million and 0 million of accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets, and approximately 0.4 million and 0 million of accounts payable, real estate taxes payable, security deposits, prepaid rents, and other accrued liabilities related to assets held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded approximately 5.1 million of losses on real estate held for sale, which are included in Impairment loss on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company did not record any losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Inflation 
 The real estate market has not been directly affected by inflation in the past several years due to increases in rents nationwide. Our lease terms are generally for a period of one year or more and rental rates reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. 
 Inflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to combat inflation and restore price stability. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges.

 Inflation has had a significant impact in the regions in which the NHT segment holds properties, causing a decrease in the willingness of the general population to travel and reduced occupancy, the effect of which may continue to impact NHT s operations. 
 Implications of being a Smaller Reporting Company 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are a "smaller reporting company" as defined in the Exchange Act, and may elect to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Management is not aware of any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, nor are we aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by government agencies. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. 
 NHT is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and NHT can change its financing strategy or leverage policies without consent of its unitholders, including the Company. 
 As a result of the NHT Acquisition, as of April 19, 2024, the Company owned 53.65 of the outstanding NHT Units and was determined to hold the controlling financial interest in NHT and consolidates NHT under applicable accounting rules. 
 Currently, NHT is governed by a board of trustees that is separate from the Company s Board of Trustees and the day-to-day operations of NHT are conducted by Aimbridge Hospitality Holdings, LLC (the Manager ), subject to oversight of the NHT board of trustees and the NHT Adviser. None of the foregoing are required to consult or receive consent of the NHT unitholders, including the Company, before changing NHT s financing strategy or leverage policies with respect to originations, growth, operation, capitalization and distributions, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile than that of the Company s existing investment portfolio or of a portfolio comprised of NHT s target investments. 
 As a unitholder in NHT, the Company generally has the ability to exercise rights of a unitholder to change the members of the board of trustees so as to affect changes at the management and operational level, however, the ability of the Company to affect changes at NHT s management and operational level could require significant costs and resources and be limited because NHT is listed on the TSXV. In order to change the members of NHT s board of trustees, the Company would have to exercise its rights as unitholder to call a special meeting, remove the existing trustees and nominate and elect new trustees in compliance with NHT s organizational documents. Because NHT is listed on the TSXV, there would also be filings and mailings to all unitholders required in connection with a special meeting of NHT and the nominees for trustee would need to comply with TSXV listing requirements, including independence standards, that may limit the Company s ability to actual affect changes at NHT s management and operational level. 
 NHT is also externally managed by the NHT Adviser pursuant to the NHT Advisory Agreement, which can only be terminated by NHT (i) upon a breach of the NHT Advisory Agreement by the NHT Adviser, after 60 days' written notice without payment of a termination fee (provided that no such notice shall be required in the event of fraud, misappropriation of funds, gross negligence, general assignment for the benefit of creditors or bankruptcy of the NHT Adviser), (ii) upon a "Cause Event" (as defined in the NHT Advisory Agreement) or (iii) for convenience on 180 days' written notice. In the event of termination for convenience or non-renewal of the NHT Advisory Agreement, the NHT Adviser will be entitled to compensation equal to three times the advisory fee, paid to the NHT Adviser over the last 12 months subject to a cap at 7.5 of the combined equity value of NHT and the NHT OP on a consolidated basis as of the date the NHT Advisory Agreement is terminated. 
 NHT relies on the NHT Adviser s expertise in identifying acquisition opportunities, transaction execution, administrative services and asset management and hotel operations management capabilities. Consequently, NHT s ability to achieve its investment objectives depends in large part on the NHT Adviser and its ability to advise NHT. This means that NHT s investments are dependent upon the NHT Adviser s business contacts within the U.S. lodging sector, its ability to successfully hire, train, supervise and manage personnel that have strong knowledge of real estate and the hotel industry in particular and its ability to operate its business in a manner that supports NHT. If NHT were to lose the services provided by the Adviser or its key personnel or if the NHT Adviser or Manager fails to perform its obligations under its agreements with NHT, NHT s investments and growth prospects may decline, and, as a result of the accounting 
 77 

Table of Contents 

 requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024, the Company s investments and growth prospects may also decline. 
 In addition, for NHT to qualify as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is not permitted to operate or manage any of the hotel properties. As a result, certain of NHT s TRSs have entered into hotel management agreements with the Manager to operate the hotel properties. For this reason, NHT is unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of the hotel properties, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage pricing, and certain similar matters. Although NHT consults with the Manager with respect to strategic business plans, the Manager is under no obligation to implement any of NHT s recommendations with respect to these matters. 
 Changes in NHT s investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies with respect to investments, originations, acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions could adversely affect NHT s business, results of operations and financial conditions and, as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024, the Company s results of operations and financial condition. Further, the ability of the Company to affect changes at NHT s management and operational level are limited by TSXV listing requirements and existing agreements with the NHT Adviser and the Manager that could require significant resources and costs to change. 
 Risk Factors Related to the Hotel and Lodging Industry 
 The Company s hotel properties may be adversely affected by various risks common to the hospitality and lodging industry. 
 All real property investments are subject to a degree of risk and uncertainty and are affected by various factors, including general economic conditions and local real estate markets. The business of the NHT segment may be adversely affected by various operating risks common to the hotel industry, including competition; over-building; dependence on business travel and tourism; changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices or interest rates; availability and cost of capital necessary to fund investments, capital expenditures and service interest, principal or other debt obligations; changes in operating costs, shortages of labor, risks of unionization of labor, increases in the costs of food and liquor; receipt and/or maintenance of licenses and permits with local authorities; relationships with brand franchisors; the ability of other lodging alternatives to attract and retain customers; changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics, and building structure and building system, health, or hygiene issues rendering properties uninhabitable on a temporary or long term basis. Any of these factors could limit or reduce the prices charged for NHT's products or services and, as a result, any of these factors can reduce NHT's profits and limit opportunities for growth. A decrease in NHT s profitability could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024. 
 The hotel industry is cyclical and changes in economic conditions, consumer behavior and the travel and tourism industries may impact the demand for the Company s hotel properties. 
 The hotel industry is cyclical. Macroeconomic and other factors beyond NHT s control can reduce demand for lodging products and services, including demand for rooms at properties owned and managed by the Company. These factors include changes and volatility in general economic conditions, including: the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy and financial markets; changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers; decreased corporate budgets and spending; low consumer confidence; depressed housing prices; financial condition of the airline and other transportation-related industries and its impact on travel; oil prices and travel costs; and cyclical over-building in the hotel ownership industry. These factors can adversely affect individual properties, particular regions or the NHT segment s business as a whole. Any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand, or the rates NHT s properties are able to charge for rooms or services or the prices at which NHT is able to sell any hotel property, which could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024. 
 Advances in technology and the growing use of online travel agencies may lead to increased costs and competition and lead to changes in consumer behavior. 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 The hotel industry may be affected by advances in technology. Consumers growing use of internet travel intermediaries OTAs and alternative lodging marketplaces may adversely affect NHT s profitability. NHT s hotel guest rooms may be booked through OTAs such as Expedia.com, Travelocity.com, Hotels.com, etc. As guest bookings through OTAs increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates and other significant contract concessions from the Company. Moreover, OTAs attempt to influence consumer choice behavior by increasing the visibility and importance of price, reviews and general indicators of quality (descriptors such as four-star lakeside hotel at the expense of brand identification on their websites and mobile applications. OTAs attract consumers by offering innovation, ease of use platforms, multiple travel products, membership programs, the ability to package travel products across different suppliers (such as car rental, guest room booking, activities tickets etc.) in one transaction, and other marketing techniques. OTAs hope that consumers will eventually develop loyalties to their online reservation system rather than to the brands under which hotel properties are franchised. The increasing reliance of consumers on online intermediaries and the continued expansion in technologies may negatively impact the strength of NHT s partner brands, traditional distribution platforms and profit margins. 
 Advances in technology have made alternative lodging accommodations a direct source of competition to the hotel industry. Alternative lodging marketplaces, such as Airbnb and VRBO, operate websites and mobile applications that market available furnished, privately-owned residential properties, including homes, condominiums and vacation homes, that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. The influx of these lodging accommodations traditionally not available to consumers and the increased acceptance of these options by consumers may lead to a reduction in demand for conventional hotel guest rooms and to an increase in supply of lodging alternatives. If the use of alternative lodging marketplaces significantly increases, particularly among NHT s key customer and location segments, its profitability may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024. 
 The NHT segment faces competition from other hotels and alternative lodging providers within the immediate vicinity of and in the broader geographic region where NHT s hotels may be located. 
 The lodging sector is highly competitive. NHT faces competition from a number of sources, including from Airbnb and from other hotels located in the immediate vicinity of and in the broader geographic areas where NHT s hotels are and may be located. NHT s hotel properties compete on the basis of location, room rates, quality, service levels, reputation and reservations systems, among many factors. NHT also faces competition from alternative lodging options such as Airbnb that have and may continue to add guest accommodations that compete with hotel inventory. OTAs may capture a greater share of guest bookings, which would have a negative impact on the strength of brands and their distribution platforms, while also adding to NHT s expenses in the form of fees to the OTAs. Such competition may reduce occupancy rates and revenues of NHT and could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Increases in the cost to NHT of acquiring hotel properties may adversely affect the ability of NHT to acquire such properties on favorable terms and may otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024. 
 The hotel industry is subject to seasonal changes, which may cause fluctuations in room revenues, occupancy levels, room rates and operating expenses in particular hotels. 
 The seasonality of the hotel industry could have a material adverse effect on NHT. The hotel industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenues. NHT s earnings may be adversely affected by factors outside NHT s control, including weather conditions and poor economic factors in certain markets in which NHT operates. This seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in room revenues, occupancy levels, room rates and operating expenses in particular hotels. NHT can provide no assurances that cash flows will be sufficient to offset any shortfalls that occur as a result of these fluctuations. A decrease in cash flows in the NHT segment could adversely affect NHT s results of operations and, as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024, the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risk Factors Related to the Business of NHT 
 All of the hotels owned by NHT are operated pursuant to franchise agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands and changes in the market perception of such brands may impact the desirability of NHT s hotels to consumers. 
 The NHT segment operates all of its hotels pursuant to franchise or license agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands. NHT s management believes that building brand value is critical to increased demand and the strengthening 
 79 

Table of Contents 

 of customer loyalty. All of the hotels in the NHT segment utilize brands owned by Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt. Consequently, if market recognition or the positive perception of Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt is reduced or compromised, the goodwill associated with the Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt-branded hotels in the NHT Portfolio may be adversely affected. Franchise agreements contain specific standards for, and restrictions and limitations on, the operation and maintenance of NHT s hotels in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor system. NHT may be required to incur costs to comply with these standards and these standards could potentially conflict with NHT s ability to create specific business plans tailored to each property and to each market. Failure to comply with these brand standards may result in termination of the applicable franchise or license agreement. Upon any such termination, NHT would be required to rebrand the hotel, which could result in substantial relicensing or rebranding costs, a decline in the value of the hotel, the loss of marketing support and participation in guest loyalty programs, and harm NHT s relationship with the franchisor, impeding NHT s ability to operate other hotels under the same brand. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on NHT and, as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024, the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 As part of its hotel business, NHT and its franchise partners are required to collect and maintain certain information about hotel employees and customers, which subjects us to risks associated with cybersecurity breaches and compliance with privacy regulations. 
 NHT, through the independent contractors affiliated with the Manager, and its franchise partners are required to collect and maintain personal information about hotel employees and, through third-party providers, collect information about customers in connection with the processing of credit and debt transactions and as part of certain of NHT s marketing programs. The collection and use of such information is regulated in the U.S. at the federal and state levels and in Canada at the federal and provincial levels, and the regulatory environment in these and other jurisdictions related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. At the same time, NHT will rely increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding customer or hotel employee information on NHT s behalf. If the security of NHT s, its franchise partners or third party providers information systems used to store or process such information is compromised, or if NHT or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, NHT or its franchise partners could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect NHT s financial performance and the Company s results of operations and financial conditions. The brand reputations of NHT s franchise partners could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair revenues or the ability to attract and retain qualified hotel personnel. 
 Privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as ransomware, and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. The security measures put in place by NHT or its franchise partners cannot provide absolute security, and NHT and its franchise partners information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to similar or other criminal cyber-attacks or data security incidents, including, ransom of data, such as, without limitation, resident and/or employee information, due to employee error, malfeasance, or other vulnerabilities. Any such incident could compromise NHT s or such franchise partner s networks, and the information stored by NHT or such franchise partner could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost, or stolen, resulting in fraud, including wire fraud related to NHT s assets, or other harm. Moreover, if a data security incident or breach affects NHT s systems or such franchise partner s systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, NHT s or such franchise partner s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and NHT may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, including, without limitation, loss related to the fact that agreements with such franchise partners or such franchise partner s financial condition, may not allow NHT to recover all costs related to a cyber breach for which they alone or they and NHT should be jointly responsible for, which could result in a material adverse effect on NHT s business, results of operations and financial condition and, as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024, the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 In the future, the Company and its franchise partners may expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Despite these steps, there can be no assurance that NHT or its franchise partners will not suffer a data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on NHT s systems or the systems of its franchise partners, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. Further, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as phishing and other forms of human engineering, are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change frequently; accordingly, NHT and its franchise partners may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.

 Fixed Costs and Capital Expenditures 
 As a matter of conducting business in the ordinary course, certain significant expenditures, including property taxes, maintenance costs, mortgage payments, insurance costs, and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property regardless of whether a property is producing sufficient income to pay such expenses. In order to retain desirable hotel destinations and to generate adequate revenue over the long term, NHT must maintain or, in some cases, improve a property s condition to meet market demand. These maintenance and improvement costs may be significant and may be costs NHT is unable to pass on to its hotel guests. NHT is also subject to utility and property tax risk relating to increased costs that NHT may experience as a result of higher resource prices as well as its exposure to significant increases in property taxes. There is a risk that property taxes may be raised as a result of revaluations of properties and their adherent tax rates. In some instances, enhancements to properties may result in significant increases in property assessments following a revaluation. Additionally, utility expenses, mainly consisting of natural gas and electricity service charges, have previously been subject to considerable price fluctuations. NHT may incur general liability related to guests on its properties for which it is found negligent, or for claims that are otherwise not fully covered by insurance. Any significant increase in these resource costs may have an adverse effect on NHT s business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations and ability to make distributions to NHT s unitholders, and, as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024, the Company s cash flow results of operations and financial condition. 
 Litigation Risks 
 In the normal course of NHT s operations, whether directly or indirectly, it may become involved in, named as a party to, or the subject of various legal proceedings, including regulatory proceedings, tax proceedings, and legal actions relating to personal injuries, property damage, property taxes, land rights, the environment, and contract disputes. The outcome with respect to outstanding, pending, or future proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and may be determined in a manner adverse to NHT and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on NHT s assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if NHT prevails in any such legal proceeding, the proceedings could be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of management and key personnel from NHT s business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on NHT s business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations, and, as a result of the accounting requirement that the Company consolidate NHT as of April 19, 2024, the Company s cash flow results of operations and financial condition. 
 Litigation at the Property Level 
 The acquisition, ownership, and disposition of real property carry certain specific litigation risks. Litigation may be commenced with respect to a property acquired by NHT or its subsidiaries in relation to activities that took place prior to NHT s acquisition of such property. In addition, at the time of disposition of an individual property, a potential buyer may claim that it should have been afforded the opportunity to purchase the asset or alternatively that such buyer should be awarded due diligence expenses incurred or damages for misrepresentation relating to disclosures made, if such buyer is passed over in favor of another as part of NHT s efforts to maximize sale proceeds. Similarly, successful buyers may later sue NHT under various damage theories, including those sounding in tort, for losses associated with latent defects or other problems not uncovered in due diligence. 
 Limitations on Sale 
 NHT may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. No assurance can be given that NHT will have funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements. In acquiring a property, NHT may agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict it from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property or debt or other contracts that are not prepayable or terminable and must be assumed by a buyer. These provisions would restrict NHT s ability to sell a property. These factors and any others that would impede NHT s ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of its properties could significantly affect NHT s financial condition and operating results and decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to NHT s unitholders. Additionally, franchisors need to approve replacement franchisees upon a sale and there is no assurance NHT will be able to locate buyers who are approved franchisees. 
 Tax-Related Risk Factors 
 81 

Table of Contents 

 Canadian Tax Risks 
 a. NHT s taxable status on its worldwide income in both Canada and the U.S. could affect the amount of funds it has available for distribution NHT is resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act and is treated as a domestic corporation in the U.S. under the Code. As a result, NHT is generally taxable on its worldwide income in both Canada and the U.S. However, in both jurisdictions, NHT generally will not be subject to tax on the portion of its income that it distributes to its unitholder (subject to certain limitations and exceptions). Management of the Company is of the view that the status of NHT as taxable in both Canada and the U.S. is not likely to give rise to any material adverse consequences in the future as it is not anticipated that NHT will be subject to material income tax in either Canada or the U.S. Nevertheless, NHT s status as taxable on its worldwide income in both Canada and the U.S. could, in certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on the Company and investors. As a result of NHT being resident in both Canada and the U.S., withholding taxes of both Canada and the U.S. will be relevant to distributions by NHT and could result in double taxation to certain investors in NHT and other consequences. 
 b. There can be no assurance that Canadian federal income tax laws respecting mutual fund trusts will not be changed in a way that adversely affects NHT NHT intends to qualify as a unit trust and a mutual fund trust for purposes of the Tax Act. There can be no assurance that Canadian federal income tax laws and the administrative policies and practices of the Canada Revenue Agency ("CRA") respecting the treatment of mutual fund trusts will not be changed in a manner that adversely affects NHT and the Company. Should NHT cease to qualify as a mutual fund trust under the Tax Act, current Canadian income tax considerations could be materially and adversely different in certain respects. 
 c. If the rules applicable to SIFTS were to apply to NHT, they could affect the amount of funds available to NHT for distribution The rules applicable to SIFTs (the SIFT Rules will apply to a trust that is a SIFT. NHT will not be considered to be a SIFT in respect of a particular taxable year and, accordingly, will not be subject to the SIFT Rules in that year, if it does not own any non-portfolio property and does not carry on business in Canada in that year. NHT has not and does not currently intend to own any non-portfolio property nor carry on a business in Canada. 
 If the SIFT Rules were to apply to NHT, they could adversely affect the marketability of investments in NHT, and the amount of cash available for distribution and the after-tax return to investors in NHT (including the Company). 
 d. NHT may realize foreign accrual property income for purposes of the Tax Act Any foreign actual property income FAPI earned directly or indirectly by any controlled foreign affiliate of NHT must be included in computing the income of NHT for the fiscal year of NHT in which the taxation year of such controlled foreign affiliate ends (including in accordance with the stub-period FAPI rules), subject to a deduction for grossed-up foreign actual tax FAT as computed in accordance with the Tax Act. It is not anticipated that the deduction for grossed-up FAT will materially offset any FAPI realized by NHT, and accordingly, any FAPI realized generally will increase the allocation of income by NHT to investors. In addition, as FAPI generally must be computed in accordance with Part I of the Tax Act as though the controlled foreign affiliate were a resident of Canada (subject to the detailed rules contained in the Tax Act), income or transactions may be taxed differently under foreign tax rules as compared to the FAPI rules and, accordingly, may result in additional income being allocated to investors. For example, certain transactions that do not give rise to taxable income under the Code may still give rise to FAPI for purposes of the Tax Act. If the rules applicable to SIFTS were to apply to NHT, they could affect the amount of funds available to NHT for distribution. The rules applicable to SIFTs (the SIFT Rules will apply to a trust that is a SIFT. NHT will not be considered to be a SIFT in respect of a particular taxable year and, accordingly, will not be subject to the SIFT Rules in that year, if it does not own any non-portfolio property and does not carry on business in Canada in that year. NHT has not and does not currently intend to own any non-portfolio property nor carry on a business in Canada. 
 e. Canadian withholding tax may apply to non-Canadian Investor s The Tax Act may impose additional withholding or other taxes on distributions made by NHT to investors in NHT (including the Company) who are non-residents of Canada for the purposes of the Tax Act. These taxes and any reduction thereof under a tax treaty between Canada and another country may change from time to time. 
 f. Income or gains may be realized by NHT as a result of currency fluctuations For purposes of the Tax Act, NHT generally is required to compute its Canadian tax results, including any FAPI earned, using Canadian 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 currency. Where an amount that is relevant in computing a taxpayer s Canadian tax results is expressed in a currency other than Canadian currency, such amount must be converted into Canadian dollars using the appropriate exchange rate determined in accordance with the detailed rules in the Tax Act in that regard. As a result, NHT may realize gains and losses for tax purposes and FAPI by virtue of the fluctuation of the value of foreign currencies relative to Canadian dollars. 
 g. Changes in Canadian tax laws could impact NHT and its investors There can be no assurance that Canadian federal income tax laws, the judicial interpretation thereof, the terms of any treaty, or the administrative practices and policies of the CRA and the Department of Finance (Canada) will not be changed in a manner that adversely affects NHT or investors in NHT (including the Company). Any such change could increase the amount of tax payable by NHT or its affiliates or could otherwise adversely affect investors in NHT by reducing the amount available to pay distributions or changing the tax treatment applicable to investors in respect of such distributions. 
 h. NHT may be subject to a tax on repurchases of equity Recent amendments to the Tax Act impose a tax on certain repurchases of equity (the Equity Repurchase Rules ), effective for transactions that occur after 2023. Under the Equity Repurchase Rules, NHT will generally be subject to a 2 tax on the value of NHT s equity repurchases (i.e., redemptions) in a taxation year (net of cash subscriptions received by NHT in that taxation year). If NHT is subject to tax under the Equity Repurchase Rules, the after-tax return to its investors could be reduced. 
 U.S. Tax Risks 
 There is limited guidance relating to the application of Section 7874 of the Code and if NHT were deemed a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, NHT would fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, causing adverse tax consequences NHT relies on Section 7874 of the Code to be classified as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an entity taxed as a corporation is generally considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Under U.S. federal income tax law, an entity which is organized under the laws of Canada would generally be classified as a non-U.S. entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception to this general rule under which a non-U.S. incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These rules are complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application. If NHT were deemed to be a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, NHT would fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, and the intended benefits of the structure would not be achieved. This would result in adverse tax consequences. Additionally, NHT could not re-elect to qualify as a REIT. If NHT did not qualify as a REIT, that could also materially adversely affect the Company s REIT status.
