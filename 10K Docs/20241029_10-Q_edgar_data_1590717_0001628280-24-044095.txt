 Recent macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation (including higher supply costs), elevated interest rates and related changes to consumer spending, including, but not limited to, causing individuals to delay or defer moves to seniors housing, has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our tenants ability to meet some of their financial

 obligations to us. Higher interest rates have also increased our costs of capital to finance acquisitions and increased our borrowing costs. We continue to monitor changes in the interest rate environment and the effect of changing rates on our business. In addition, current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting market volatility may adversely impact our ability to sell properties on acceptable terms, if at all, which could result in additional impairment charges. 
 As a result of the above factors, our tenants are continuing to experience elevated operating costs at their facilities. At a portfolio wide level, occupancy levels at our seniors housing facilities, comprising our ALFs and ILFs, continue to remain below occupancy levels at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within our SNFs, occupancy levels have continued to improve since their trough in January 2021 and have reached or exceeded occupancy levels prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, for most of our tenants. 
 As a result of impacts experienced by our operators since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and due to recent market trends and uncertainties, the ability of some of our tenants and borrowers to meet their financial obligations to us in full has been negatively impacted. From time to time in the past, we have taken actions to reposition one or more properties with a replacement tenant or sell the property and, in certain cases, we have also restructured tenants long-term obligations. See Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale and Asset Sales below. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 98.7 of contractual rents and interest due from our operators and borrowers excluding cash deposits. In the event our tenants or borrowers are unable to satisfy their obligations to us and we are unable to effect these actions on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place, our rental and interest income would be adversely impacted and we may incur additional expenses or obligations and be required to recognize additional impairment charges or fair value adjustments. 
 
 Regulatory Updates 
 On October 13, 2023, California Senate Bill No. 525 SB 525 was signed into law, requiring a substantial increase in the minimum wage for workers operating in certain health care facilities. As a result of SB 525, certain health care facilities (including licensed skilled nursing facilities) operating in California are required to increase the wages of their covered health care employees to at least 21 per hour, which was initially required to be effective from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026, 22 or 23 per hour (depending on facility type) from June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2028, and 25 per hour after June 1, 2028. After the initial implementation was delayed by the Governor of California in June 2024, SB 525 went into effect on October 16, 2024. 
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS issued a final rule on July 31, 2024, updating Medicare payment policies and rates for SNFs for fiscal year 2025. This update includes a 4.2 increase in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs, totaling approximately 1.4 billion. These increases are expected to partially offset some of our tenants higher operating costs. 
 On April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections at nursing homes in order to establish comprehensive nurse staffing requirements. The rule consists of three core staffing requirements: (1) overall minimum standard of 3.48 total nurse staff hours per resident day; (2) minimum nurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses and 2.45 hours of care from a certified nurse s aid per resident per day; and (3) a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rule includes a staggered implementation approach for which CMS will publish additional details on compliance as the implementation dates approach. The rule also includes possible waivers and temporary hardship exemptions for select facilities, however no funding for the additional staff will be provided. We are currently evaluating the impact of the rule, but believe the unfunded mandate to increase staff may have a material and adverse impact on the financial condition of our tenants.

 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 
 On October 29, 2024, in connection with a joint venture arrangement (the Tennessee JV between the Operating Partnership and an unaffiliated third party, the Operating Partnership became bound by the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Tennessee JV has agreed to acquire 31 skilled nursing facilities (the Tennessee SNF Facilities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 500 million, exclusive of transaction costs. In connection with the Tennessee JV s acquisition of the Tennessee SNF Facilities, the Operating Partnership is expected to contribute approximately 442 million toward the aggregate purchase price to the Tennessee JV and, in exchange, the Operating Partnership will own 100 of the preferred equity ownership interests in the Tennessee JV representing 92.5 of the total investment and 50 of the common ownership interests in the Tennessee JV representing 3.75 of the total investment. The Tennessee SNF Facilities consist of a total of 3,290 licensed beds, with 30 of the facilities located in Tennessee and one in Alabama. We contributed 8.5 million to the Tennessee JV, which was used to partially fund the earnest money deposit under the Purchase Agreement. 
 Completion of the Tennessee JV s acquisition of the Tennessee SNF Facilities is subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in two phases during December 2024. At closing, the Tennessee SNF Facilities are anticipated to be operated by affiliates of PACS Group, Inc. (twelve facilities), The Ensign Group (nine facilities), and Links Healthcare Group (seven facilities), who are all current tenants of ours, as well as one new operator relationship (three facilities), under long-term master leases. Three of Ensign s nine facilities will be acquired by Ensign s real estate subsidiary with the remaining six to be included in a new master lease. Initial annual base rent to the Tennessee JV relating to the Tennessee SNF Facilities is expected to aggregate approximately 44.4 million.

 At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock 
 On August 29, 2024, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to 750.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common stock through an at-the-market equity offering program (the New ATM Program and terminated our previous 500.0 million at-the-market equity offering program (together, with all previous at-the-market equity offering programs, the Previous ATM Programs and together with the New ATM Program, the ATM Program ). In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, the ATM Program also provides for the ability to enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an ATM forward contract with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under the ATM Program. 
 In the event we enter into an ATM forward contract to sell shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program, we would expect to fully physically settle forward equity sales by delivery of shares of common stock to the forward purchaser and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates, which are typically a one-year term, at our discretion, prior to the final settlement date, at which time we would expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares sold on a forward basis multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we would expect to receive upon physical settlement would be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser s stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends through the settlement. 
 The following tables summarize the ATM Program activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share amounts).

 Asset Sales and Held for Sale Reclassifications 
 We periodically reassess our investments and tenant relationships, and from time to time we have selectively disposed of certain facilities or investments, or terminated tenant relationships, and we expect to continue making such reassessments and, where appropriate, taking such actions. We classify our real estate investments as held for sale when the applicable criteria have been met, which includes a formal plan to sell the properties that is expected to be completed within one year, among other criteria. Upon designation as held for sale, we cease depreciation and record the investment at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell, which could result in an impairment of the real estate investments held for sale, if necessary. 
 On August 30, 2024, we completed the sale of a portfolio of 11 SNFs located in Iowa and Georgia, leased to affiliates of Arboreta Healthcare, Inc., as shown in the table below.

 To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors. 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating and interest expenses directly associated with our properties, including: 
 interest expense and scheduled debt maturities on outstanding indebtedness; 
 general and administrative expenses; 
 dividend plans; 
 operating lease obligations; and 
 capital expenditures for improvements to our properties. 
 Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions and other investments (including mortgage and mezzanine loan originations), capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to invest in and/or develop additional healthcare and seniors housing properties as suitable opportunities arise and so long as adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in and/or development of properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, borrowings available to us under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to our ATM Program or additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions and refinancing of existing mortgage loans. 
 We believe that our expected operating cash flow from rent collections and interest payments on our other real estate related investments, together with our cash balance, available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) and availability under the ATM Program will be sufficient to meet ongoing debt service requirements, dividend plans, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other needs for at least the next 12 months. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. While we may from time to time sell properties as part of our hold / investment strategy on an investment-by-investment basis, we currently do not expect to sell any of our properties to meet liquidity needs. Our quarterly cash dividend and any failure of our operators to pay rent or of our borrowers to make interest or principal payments may impact our available capital resources. 
 We have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expires in February 2026 and at or prior to such time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. The shelf registration statement allows us or certain of our subsidiaries, as applicable, to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units and debt securities through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, in one or more offerings on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering. On August 29, 2024, we entered into the New ATM Program. In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more ATM forward contracts with sales agents for the sale of shares of our common stock under

 the ATM Program. See At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock for information regarding activity under the ATM Program. 
 Although we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all debt covenants on our outstanding indebtedness. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents selected data from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 169,043 112,096 Net cash used in investing activities (828,087) (232,305) Net cash provided by financing activities 741,698 110,516 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 82,654 (9,693) Cash and cash equivalents as of the beginning of period 294,448 13,178 Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of period 377,102 3,485 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating cash inflows are derived primarily from the rental payments received under our lease agreements, including as a result of new investments, and interest payments on our other real estate related investments. Operating cash outflows consist primarily of interest expense on our borrowings and general and administrative expenses. The net increase of 56.9 million in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in rental income received, an increase in interest income received on our other real estate related investments, and a decrease in cash paid for interest expense, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for general and administrative expense. 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of 777.1 million in acquisitions of real estate, investment in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and escrow deposits for potential acquisitions of real estate, 52.0 million in preferred equity investments and 4.2 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate, partially offset by 5.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of real estate and 0.1 million in principal payments received on other loans receivable. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of 253.3 million in acquisitions of real estate, investment in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and escrow deposits for potential acquisitions of real estate and 9.1 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate, partially offset by 15.7 million of principal payments received from our other real estate related investments and other loans receivable and 14.5 million in net proceeds from real estate sales. 
 Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily comprised of 1.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, 75.0 million in proceeds from a secured borrowing and 1.2 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a 200.0 million prepayment of the Term Loan, 122.4 million in dividends paid, a 75.0 million payment on the secured borrowing, a 2.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock, and 0.4 million payment on extinguishment of debt and deferred financing costs. Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily comprised of 319.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and 1.1 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by 125.0 million in net payments under our Revolving Facility, 83.1 million in dividends paid and a 1.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock.

 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include: 
 3.875 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028 
 On June 17, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, CTR Partnership, L.P. (the Operating Partnership ), and its wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust Capital Corp. (together with the Operating Partnership, the Issuers ), completed a private offering of 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 Senior Notes due 2028 (the Notes ). The Notes mature on June 30, 2028. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.875 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, commencing on December 30, 2021. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and all of our subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that guarantee obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture governing the Notes. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Notes. 
 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan 
 On December 16, 2022, we, together with certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the Second Amended Credit Agreement ). The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and the obligations thereunder are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries. The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates our amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the Prior Credit Agreement provided for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of 600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10 of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10 of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the Term Loan and together with the Revolving Facility, the Second Amended Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. 
 On October 10, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association (the First Amendment ). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received. 
 On September 19, 2024 (the Prepayment Date ), we prepaid all 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan. The Term Loan was prepaid at the principal amount of the Term Loan, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the Prepayment Date. During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.3 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of the Term Loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at our sole discretion, two six-month extension options. Prior to prepayment, the Term Loan had a maturity date of February 8, 2026. 
 The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operat ing Partnership s option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10 to 0.55 per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10 to 1.55 per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership s election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan were, at the Operating Partnership s option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50 to 1.20 per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50 to 2.20 per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership s election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15 to 0.35 per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (unless we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125 to 0.30 per annum based off the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt).

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Second Amended Credit Agreement. 
 Capital Expenditures and Earn-Out Payments for Real Estate 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had committed to fund expansions, construction, capital improvements and ESG incentives, which provides eligible triple-net tenants with monetary inducements to make sustainable improvements to our properties, at certain triple-net leased facilities totaling 14.8 million, of which 7.2 million is subject to rent increase at the time of funding. We expect to fund the capital expenditures in the next one to two years. As of September 30, 2024, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement which provided for an earn-out obligation of up to 10.0 million for one SNF in Virginia which was acquired during 2024. The earn-out is available, contingent on the operator achieving certain thresholds per the agreement, beginning in October 2025 through October 2026. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further i nformation regarding our obligation to finance certain capital expenditures under our triple-net leases. 
 Dividend Plans 
 We are required to pay dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and we expect to make quarterly dividend payments in cash with the annual dividend amount no less than 90 of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. See Note 8, Equity, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a summary of the cash dividends per share of our common stock declared by our board of directors for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification, as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Ope rations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, for further information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate indebtedness. 
 Our Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of 600.0 million from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. 
 The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Company s option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10 to 0.55 per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10 to 1.55 per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership s election if the Company obtains certain specified i nvestment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). As of September 30, 2024 , we had no bor rowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan was prepaid. 
 An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquis ition by us more costly as well as increase the costs of our variable rate debt obligations. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. Increased 
 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 inflation may also have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. 
 We may, in the future, manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. However, the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities, which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had no swap agreements to hedge our interest rate risks. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
