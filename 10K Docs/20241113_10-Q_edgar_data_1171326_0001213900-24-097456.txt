NOTE 

Entrepreneur Universe
Bright Group, a Nevada corporation EUBG or the Company ), is not a Chinese operating company but a Nevada
holding company. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, EUBG conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries
in Hong Kong and in the People s Republic of China PRC or China ). Therefore our shareholders will not
directly hold any equity interests in our Chinese operating subsidiaries. Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise,
when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Form 10-Q ), the terms we, us, and our 
refer to EUBG and its consolidated subsidiaries, or any one or more of them as the context may require, HK subsidiary refers
to Entrepreneurship World Technology Holding Group Company Limited, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a Hong Kong limited company, and PRC
subsidiary refers to Xi an Yunchuang Space Information Technology Co., Ltd., f/k/a Entrepreneurship World Consultants Limited,
a wholly-foreign owned Chinese subsidiary of HK subsidiary. EUBG is a holding company for its operating subsidiaries. 

We currently do not,
and we do not plan to use variable interest entities VIE to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations.
We do not have any contractual arrangements between the holding company, the HK subsidiary, and the PRC subsidiary. EUBG is a Nevada holding
company and does not have any substantive operations other than directly or indirectly holding the equity interest in our operating subsidiaries
in Hong Kong and China. Therefore our shareholders will not directly hold any equity interests in our Chinese operating subsidiaries.
Our holding company structure involves unique risks to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our corporate structure,
which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock, including that
it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. 

To the extent you make
any investment in our Company, it will be in EUBG, our holding company in Nevada, and not in our operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong or
in China. Because substantially all of our operations are conducted in China through our PRC subsidiary, the PRC government may exercise
significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may exert more supervision over our operations, which could
have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock. The PRC government could also significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to list and/or remain listed on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, and to offer future securities
to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

There are significant
legal and operational risks associated with being in and conducting a substantial portion of our operations in mainland China. PRC laws
and regulations governing our current business operations and corporate structure are sometimes vague and uncertain, and we face the risk
that changes in the PRC laws, regulations and policies, including how those laws, regulations and policies will be interpreted or implemented
could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC which would likely result in a material change
in our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock, including that it could cause the value of such securities to
significantly decline or become worthless. Furthermore, these risks may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer our securities to investors in the future. 

Recently, the PRC government
has sought to exert more oversight and supervision over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China based
issuers. For example, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation
of business operations in China, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based
companies listed overseas using a VIE structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts
in anti-monopoly enforcement. We may be subject to regulations relating to overseas securities offering and listing of China-based companies,
including pursuant to the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law issued by the PRC government
authorities, which called for enhanced oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by Chinese
companies, and proposed measures such as the construction of regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based
overseas-listed companies; the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies and the
supporting guidelines issued by China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC ), which regulate overseas securities offering
and listing activities by China-based companies; the Regulations on Network Data Security Management (the Network Data Regulation issued by the State Council of China on September 24, 2024 and will be effective on January 1, 2025, which requires, among other things,
where network data processing activities carried out by a network data processor affect or may affect national security, national security
review shall be conducted in accordance with the relevant provisions issued by the state. ; the Revised Cybersecurity Review Measures,
jointly issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC, and
several other administrations, which require, among other things, that a network platform operator holding over one million users 
personal information must apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before any public offering or listing
outside of Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. Any future action by the PRC government expanding the categories of industries and companies
whose foreign securities offerings are subject to government review could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

ii 

As of the date of this filing, our operating subsidiaries have not
been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the Cyberspace Administrative of China (the CAC based on the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) and the Network Data Regulation, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning,
sanctions in such respect or any regulatory objections to this registration of our shares of common stock with the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC ). However, it is still uncertain what existing or new laws or regulations will be modified or promulgated,
or the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operations or our ability to accept
foreign investments and list on a U.S. exchange. If we are subject to such a probe or if we are required to comply with stepped-up supervisory
requirements, valuable time from our management and money may be expended in complying and/or responding to the probe and requirements,
thus diverting valuable resources and attention away from our operations. This may, in turn, negatively impact our operations. 

As advised by our PRC
legal counsel, we need to file with the CSRC within three business days after our application for overseas listing in a new capital market
is submitted. As of the date of this filing, nor have we, or our subsidiaries, applied for or received any denial for the registration
of our shares of common stock with the SEC. However, The General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According
to Law, or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen
the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies.
Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents
of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters. The Opinions
and any related implementing rules to be enacted may subject us to compliance requirement in the future. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC
issued the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies and five supporting guidelines
which became effective on March 31, 2023. Thus, we are required to file with the CSRC within three business days after our application
for overseas listing in a new capital market is submitted. Failure to perform our filing obligations may result in penalties imposed on
the Company and responsible officers. In addition, we shall report to the CSRC upon occurrence of certain material events after our listing
on the stock exchange outside of Chinese Mainland, including change of control, investigations or sanctions imposed by overseas securities
regulatory authorities, change of listing status or transfer of listing segment, and voluntary or mandatory delisting. Given the current
regulatory environment in the PRC, we are still subject to the uncertainty of interpretation and enforcement of the rules and regulations
in the PRC, which can change quickly with little advance notice, and any future actions of the PRC authorities. We cannot assure you that
relevant PRC government agencies would reach the same conclusion as we do or as advised by our PRC legal counsel. However, (i) if we inadvertently
concluded that no other permissions, approvals or filings are required, or (ii) if the CSRC, the CAC or other regulatory PRC agencies
later promulgate new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals or finish other procedures to issue the Company s common stock
to foreign investors, and we are unable to obtain a waiver of such requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such
a waiver, then we may not be able to issue our shares. In addition, any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such requirements
could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our securities. 

The PRC laws and regulations
and government policy changes rapidly on digital training. For our digital training related services, we worked with Beida Jade Bird Vocational
Education Jade Bird which was an authorized licensee of China National Personal Talent Training Network CNPTTN ),
a PRC regulatory agency for the talent training. Jade Bird was in charge of its training courses, and the Company was authorized by Jade
Bird as its sole training related administrator of the key opinion leader (KOL) training courses and to coordinate the digital training
related services to individual clients who were interested in becoming KOL conducting live-broadcasting business through social media.
The Company provided training related services, to these individual clients who subscribed courses, in arranging the examination, following
up certificate issuance processes, addressing clients concerns, etc. On March 22, 2022, the PRC subsidiary learned that Jade Bird
suspended its service after receiving a notice from CNPTTN and that until further notice CNPTTN has suspended all recruitment services
using its CNPTTN s name. As a result of CNPTTN s suspension, on March 22, 2022, our PRC subsidiary has also suspended its
digital training related services with Jade Bird. As it is highly unlikely that such digital training services by the Company will resume
in the foreseeable future, the Company has refunded all advance payments made by clients who were unable to receive such training-related
services. If we were to resume KOL related training services in the future, laws and regulations and the CNPTTN may require our PRC subsidiary
to meet additional requirements or obtain additional approvals, licenses or permits to conduct KOL training related business. If our PRC
subsidiary is unable to meet the relevant requirements or obtain the relevant approvals, licenses or permits, our PRC subsidiary may not
be able to continue to conduct the KOL training related business. As of the date of this report, there is no further notice from CNPTTN
and the service is still being suspended. Other than the above, we and our subsidiaries are currently not required to obtain permission
from any of the PRC authorities to operate its principal business. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies would reach
the same conclusion as we do. If (i) we inadvertently concluded that such permissions or approvals are not required, or (ii) the relevant
regulatory PRC agencies later promulgate new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals to operate our business, and we are unable
to obtain approval or a waiver of such approval requirements, any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval requirement
could have a material adverse effect on our business operation and the trading price of our securities. 

iii 

Although we concluded that we and our subsidiaries are currently not
required to obtain any specified permissions from any of the PRC central or local government and that we have not received any denial
to registration on the OTC market or to conduct our current business operations, if (x) we inadvertently conclude that such approvals
are not required when they are, (y) we do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals if and when required, or (z) changes in
applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations relating to our business or industry which would require us to obtain approvals in the
future, our operations, financial conditions, and results of operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, and the value
of the Company s common stock could significantly decline or become worthless. 

On July 7, 2022, the
CAC promulgated the Measures for the Security Assessment for Cross-border Transfer of Data (the Security Assessment measures ),
which came into effect on September 1, 2022. The Security Assessment measures stipulates that data processors which provide data cross-border
and have one of the following circumstances, should apply the security assessment to the national network information department through
the provincial branches of network information department: (A) data processors to provide important data cross-border; (B) operators of
critical information infrastructure and data processors handling personal information of more than 1 million people to provide personal
information cross-border;(C) data processors which provide cross-border a cumulative total of 100,000 people s personal information
or 10,000 people s sensitive personal information since January 1 of the previous year; (D) other situations requiring application
for the security assessment regarding providing data cross-border as stipulated by the state Internet information department. As of the
date of this filing, the PRC subsidiary has not provided any important data or personal data to any offshore institutions or individuals,
so the PRC subsidiary does not need to apply for a security assessment at this stage. However, if we need to provide data to offshore
institutions or individuals in the future and fall into the situations which should apply for the security assessment, we might not pass
the security assessment. 

In December 2020, the
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA ), was signed into law as part of a continued regulatory focus in the United
States on access to audit and other information currently protected by national law. The HFCAA states if the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject
to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the
SEC shall prohibit securities from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the U.S.
Following the filing of our Form 10 for fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which was audited by Centurion ZD CPA Co. CZD
CPA ), an audit firm headquartered in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction that the PCAOB has determined that the PCAOB is unable to conduct
inspections or investigate auditors, the SEC added us to its list of Commission-Identified Issuers identified under HFCAA. In December
2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act AHFCAA was signed into law, which amended the HFCAA to
shorten the three-year period to two years. 

On September 7, 2022,
the Company dismissed CZD CPA and appointed Prager Metis CPAs, LLC PragerMetis as the Company s independent auditor
for the fiscal year end December 31, 2022. Our current auditors, PragerMetis, is located at Hackensack, New Jersey, and has been inspected
by the PCAOB. We expect that this will satisfy the PCAOB inspection requirements for the audit of our consolidated financial statements,
subject to compliance with SEC and other requirements prior to the two-year deadline of the AHFCAA. 

iv 

Further, on August 26,
2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and the Ministry of Finance
of the PRC, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered
in Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect
and investigate audit firms in the People s Republic of China (PRC) for the first time in history, in 2022. Therefore, on December
15, 2022, the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. 

EUBG is permitted to
transfer cash as a loan and/or capital contribution to the HK subsidiary for its operations and the HK subsidiary is permitted to transfer
cash as a loan and/or capital contribution to the PRC subsidiary for capital investment and company operations. For instance, the PRC
subsidiary will use the cash for their daily business operations. However, under existing PRC regulations, any loans made to our PRC subsidiaries
shall not exceed a statutory limit, and shall be filed with PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange SAFE or its local
bureau. Additionally, any capital contributions the HK subsidiary make to the PRC subsidiary shall be filed with the local commerce department.
The PRC subsidiary is the main operating company to earn revenue. The HK subsidiary is also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong SAR
to provide funding to EUBG through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. Current PRC laws require that
dividends be paid only out of the profit for the year calculated according to PRC accounting principles, which differ from the generally
accepted accounting principles in other jurisdictions. In addition, PRC laws also require a foreign-invested enterprise to set aside at
least 10 of its after-tax profits, if any, to fund its statutory reserves, until the aggregate amount reaches 50 of its registered capital.
In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may, at its discretion, allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting
principles to enterprise expansion funds, staff welfare, and bonus funds. Those reserve funds are not available for distribution as cash
dividends. The PRC government s control of foreign currency conversion may limit our foreign exchange transactions. Under existing
PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE.
However, approval from SAFE, or registration with SAFE or other appropriate departments is required where RMB shall be converted into
foreign currency and be remitted out of the PRC. Failure to comply with the above regulations may result in liability under PRC laws for
evasion of foreign exchange controls. 

As of the date of this filing, our PRC subsidiary has distributed 12.9
million (net of withholding tax at 1,4 million charged at a rate of 10 of the declared dividend) to its holding parent, which is our
HK subsidiary. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with the above regulations in all respects in the future. If we
fail to comply with the above regulations, our ability to transfer cash and distribute earnings may be negatively affected, which could
materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. Since EUBG, the Nevada holding company,
is not the direct parent company of the PRC subsidiary, EUBG and the PRC subsidiary cannot make transfers to each other. On August 26,
2024, EUBG s board of directors declared a special one-time cash dividend of 0.0013 per share of EUBG s common stock, totaling
approximately 2.2 million, paid on or about September 12, 2024 to shareholders of record as of August 30, 2024. Other than as previously
described, no cash transfer or transfer of other assets (including dividends and distribution) have occurred among EUBG, our Nevada holding
company, and either of its subsidiaries, our HK subsidiary or our PRC subsidiary. 

The PRC government has
significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political
and societal goals. To the extent that the cash and assets of our business are in our PRC subsidiary and/or Hong Kong subsidiary, such
cash or assets may not be available to fund our operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to the potential
intervention by the PRC government to impose restrictions and limitations over our ability or our subsidiaries ability to transfer
cash or assets. Any such influence on our business operations or action to exert more oversight and supervision over the cash or assets
of our subsidiaries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock,
or significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of
such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. 

On September 1, 2021,
our PRC subsidiary adopted a written Monetary and Cash Fund Management System Cash Management Policy for its operations
in China and Hong Kong. The Cash Management Policy covers cash, bank deposits and other monetary funds owned by the PRC subsidiary and
Hong Kong subsidiary and includes procedures on receiving funds, depositing funds, transferring funds and proper documentation and recording
of cash. We adopted the Cash Management Policy in order to provide a process and guidance on collecting, accounting for, and safeguarding
all cash and cash equivalents of our PRC subsidiary and Hong Kong subsidiary, including 1) checking the latest regulation requirements
between China and Hong Kong; and 2) seeking approval from EUBG s chief executive officer in order to transfer funds from our PRC
subsidiary to our HK subsidiary. EUBG does not have a cash management policy. 

For detailed discussions
on such risks, please see the section captioned Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report 
or Form 10-K ), filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 

EUBG is a holding company for its operating subsidiaries that provide
marketing consultancy services and sourcing and marketing services in China. While substantially all of our operations are located in
China, we currently do not, and we do not plan to use variable interest entities to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based
operations. However, because our operations are in China and our major shareholders are located in China, there is always a risk that
the Chinese government may exert certain supervision over the operations of any company with any level of operations in China, including
its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept
foreign investment. If any or all of the foregoing were to occur, it could, in turn, result in a material change in the Company s
operations and/or the value of its common stock and/or significantly limit or completely hinder its ability to offer or continue to offer
securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

Segment and Related
Information 

We operate as a single
reportable segment provision of consulting, sourcing and marketing services in China .

Revenue and cost of
revenue 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of 1,670,203, which represents a decrease of 44,583 or 2.6 as
compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was mainly attributed to our consultation services in connection with a
client engaged in live streaming business which dropped by 455,815. However, this decrease was partly offset by a 411,053 increase
in our other consultation services. 

Cost of revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 was 179,352, which represented an increase of 65,312 or 57.3 as compared to the same period in
the prior year. The increase in cost of revenue is mainly due to the introduction of a new service provider. 

Profit margin for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 was 89.3 , which represents a decrease of 4.1 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
It indicates that the additional consultancy costs and labor costs involved in the cost of revenue outweighed the slight increase in revenue,
resulting in a lower profit margin. 

As a result of the above,
the gross profit was 1,490,851 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represented a decrease of 109,895 or 4.1 as compared
to the same period in the prior year.

fees, payroll expenses and consultancy fees. 

Total other income, net

ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net other income of 52,317, which represented a difference of 42,870 or 453.8 as compared to
the same period in the prior year. Our net other income mainly consisted of bank interest income, exchange rate differences and sundry
income. The difference is primarily attributed to the unrealized exchange gain recorded as a result of the appreciation of the RMB against
the HKD.

During the three months
ended September 30, 2024, we incurred income tax expense of 414,212, which represented a decrease of 65,323 or 13.6 as compared to

tax incurred in Hong Kong.

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of 4,194,477, which represents a decrease of 403,187 or 8.8 as compared to the same
period in the prior year. The decrease was mainly attributed to our consultation services in connection with a client engaged in live

our other consultation services. 

Cost of revenue for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 510,490, which represented an increase of 173,315 or 51.4 as compared to the same period in
the prior year. The increase in cost of revenue is mainly due to the introduction of a new service provider and the salary adjustments
for certain employees. 

Profit margin for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 87.8 , which represents a decrease of 4.8 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
It indicates that the additional consultancy costs and labor costs involved in the cost of revenue outweighed the slight increase in revenue,
resulting in a lower profit margin. 

As a result of the above,

to the same period in the prior year.

same period in the prior year. Our net other income mainly consisted of bank interest income, exchange rate differences and sundry income.
The slight difference is primarily attributed to certain sundry income recorded in the last year that did not recur in the current period
and the lower of unrealized exchange loss recorded as a result of the depreciation of the RMB against the HKD in the current period. 

Income tax expense 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we incurred income tax expense of 997,621, which represented a decrease of 230,052 or 18.7 as compared to

outflow arising from deferred tax adjustment was 4,277 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash inflow of 129,523
as compared to the same period in the prior year. The difference was mainly due to our PRC subsidiary generated net profits of 1,425,578
and 1,863,074 respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; while the PRC subsidiary distributed dividends of
RMB20,000,000 (equivalent to 2,782,570) to our Hong Kong subsidiary in current year, representing double the amount compared to the
same period in the prior year. 

Cash inflow of trade
receivables was 17,942 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash outflow of 437,017 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The changes in cash flow from trade receivables were primarily attributed to the changes in the consultation business.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in the consultation business compared to the previous period end resulted in
a lower trade receivables balance and a cash inflow of 17,942. On the other hand, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the consultation
business experienced significant growth compared to the previous period end, leading to a higher trade receivables balance and a cash
outflow of 437,017. 

Cash outflow of other receivables and prepayments was 111,519 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash inflow of 30,257 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change
in cash flow of 141,776 was primarily due to prepayments for a consulting service for market research totaling 78,083 and professional
fees of 60,000 as of September 30, 2024. 

Cash outflow of tax payables
was 54,072 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash inflow of 301,211 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. Our tax payables consist of the Enterprise Income Tax charged in China, which is accrued on a quarterly basis and settled in the
subsequent quarter. The changes in cash flow from tax payables were primarily influenced by the income tax provision and income tax paid
during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income tax provision was 719,168 less than the income tax paid of
 912,369, leading to the cash outflow of 54,072. Conversely, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the income tax provision was
 951,312 exceeded the income tax paid of 650,101, resulting the cash inflow of 301,211.

Cash flows used in
investing activities 

No cash movement of investing activities was resulted
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due
to purchase of property, plant and equipment. 

Cash flows used in
financing activities 

The cash used in financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to dividends paid of 2,211,536 to the shareholders. The cash used in
financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to repayment to a director for the amount advanced by a director. 

Future Capital Requirements 

We believe that our ability
to generate cash from operations are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for at least the next 12
months. Our ability to generate adequate cash from operations in the future, however, will depend on, among other things, our ability
to successfully implement our business strategies while continuing to tightly control our expenses, and to manage the impact of changes
to the PRC regulatory environment. We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those strategies and cost control
initiatives, or successfully adjust to any changes to PRC laws and regulations impacting our business. In addition, changes in our operating
plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, interest rate increases, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional
debt or equity financing in future periods. We can give no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Additional
equity financing could be dilutive to holders of the Company s common stock; debt financing, if available, could impose additional
cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions.

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company is a smaller
reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the
period covered by this Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the 1934 Act). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024,
our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 

The Company determined
that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below as of September 30, 2024. 

1. 
 We did not maintain appropriate cash controls We had not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on our bank accounts. However, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated in part by the fact that we had introduced certain cash management policies. 

2. 
 We did not implement appropriate information technology controls We were retaining copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of our data or off-site storage of the data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

3. 
 We currently lack sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. 

4. 
 We do not have adequate written policies and procedures Due to lack of adequate written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, we did not establish a formal process to close our books monthly and account for all transactions in a timely manner. 

Accordingly, we concluded
that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls. 

Due to our small size
and the early stage of our business, segregation of duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. We have limited
capital resources and have given priority in the use of those resources to our business development efforts. As a result, we have not
been able to take steps to improve our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. However,
we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. Once our operations grow and become
more complex, our Board of Directors will take steps to remediate these material weaknesses as soon as practicable: 

1. 
 We plan to formalize and provide training, on certain policies, including cash control. 

2. 
 We plan, as funding permits, to engage a third-party consultant to help evaluate and improve the design of appropriate information technology controls. 

3. 
 We plan, as funding permits, to appoint additional personnel with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience to assist with the preparation of our financial reporting. 

4. 
 Prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions, in a timely manner. 

Despite the material
weaknesses and deficiencies reported above, our management believes that our financial statements included in this report fairly present
in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that this report
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light
of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report. 

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than as described
above, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed quarter ended September
30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we
may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. To the
best knowledge of management, there are no material legal proceedings pending against the Company. 

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our
common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks set forth in the section captioned Risk Factors 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, before making an
investment decision. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that
case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section
captioned Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking
