 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 (Unaudited) 

 . The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). 
 The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company s formation, the initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering ), which is described below, identifying a target Company for a Business Combination and working to consummate a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating
 income in the form of interest income from the investments held in the Trust Account (as defined below). 
 The registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering (the IPO Registration Statement was declared effective on September 30, 2021. On October 5, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of units (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the Public Shares ), generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 3. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of units (the Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to Marblegate Acquisition LLC (the Sponsor and Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor ), generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. 
 Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of of underwriting fees, net of reimbursement, of deferred underwriting fees, of other offering costs (including for the fair value of the private warrants included in the Private Placement Units, and of offering costs) and for the fair value of the Founder Shares attributable to certain anchor investors (see Note 5). 
 Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on October 5, 2021, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account ), located in the United States and held in cash items or invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of
 the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s stockholders, as described below. 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 
 The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least either prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. 

or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 
 The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial
 Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 
 On December 7, 2022, the Company filed an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the First Extension Amendment ). The First Extension Amendment extended the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from January 5, 2023, to July 5, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors. In connection with the First Extension Amendment, stockholders holding shares of the Company s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately million (approximately per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company had Public Shares outstanding. 
 On June 27, 2023, the Company filed a second amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Second Extension Amendment ). The Second Extension Amendment extended the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination for an additional six (6) months, from July 5, 2023 to January 5, 2024, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors. In connection with the Second Extension Amendment, stockholders holding shares of the Company s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately million (approximately per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company had Public Shares outstanding. 
 On June 28, 2023, in connection with the Second Extension Amendment, the Sponsor converted shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock (the Founder Conversion ), which represented of the outstanding shares of the Company s Class A common stock as of the date of the conversion. 
 On December 19, 2023, the Company filed a third amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Third Extension Amendment ). The Third Extension Amendment extended the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination for an additional nine (9) months, from January 5, 2024 to October 5, 2024, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors. In connection with the Third Extension Amendment, stockholders holding Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately million (approximately per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company had Public Shares outstanding. 
 On September 10, 2024, the Company filed a fourth amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Fourth Extension Amendment ). The Fourth Extension Amendment extends the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from October 5, 2024, to April 5, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors. In connection with the Fourth Extension Amendment, stockholders holding Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately million (approximately per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company has Public Shares outstanding. 

of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 
 The Sponsor and Cantor have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Private Placement Units (the Private Placement Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than . 
 In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
 The anchor investors will not be entitled to (i) redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares held by them in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (iii) rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period). 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. In April 2024, the Treasury issued proposed regulations providing guidance with respect to the excise tax. Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Under the proposed regulations, liquidating distributions made by special purpose acquisition companies are exempt from the excise tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with the Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax depending on a number of factors. Because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming stockholders, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not yet been determined. The obligation of the Company to pay any excise tax could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete the Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete the Business Combination.

shares of Common Stock elected to redeem their shares in connection with the Second Extension Amendment. As a result, was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. On December 19, 2023, holders of shares of Common Stock elected to redeem their shares in connection with the Third Extension Amendment. As a result, was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. On September 10, 2024, holders of shares of common stock elected to redeem their shares in connection with the Fourth Extension Amendment. As a result, was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. 
 Management has evaluated the requirements of the IR Act and the Company s operations and has determined that is required to be recorded as a liability, which remained outstanding on the Company s balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. This liability will be reevaluated and remeasured at the end of each quarterly period. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. These regulations provided that the filing and payment deadline for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 would be October 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this obligation. Any amount of such excise tax not paid in full will be subject to additional interest and penalties which are currently estimated at interest per annum and a underpayment penalty per month or portion of a month up to of the total liability for any amount that is unpaid from November 1, 2024 until paid in full. 
 Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024 the Company had in its operating bank accounts, in the Trust Account held in an interest-bearing demand deposit account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its common stock in connection therewith and an adjusted working capital deficit of which excludes franchise and income taxes payable as such amounts can be paid from the interest earned in the Trust Account. As of September 30, 2024, of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company s tax obligations. 
 Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination and/or any other related activities. 
 The Company may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs Working Capital Loans ). Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. In instances of working capital deficits, the Sponsor has agreed to fund cash shortfalls up to . On June 30, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note to a member of the Sponsor for a working capital loan for which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate amount of (see Note 5).

 Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until April 5, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors), to consummate a Business Combination.

If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date and an extension has not been requested by the Sponsor and approved by the Company s stockholders, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity issue and the mandatory liquidation raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be required to liquidate after April 5, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors). The Company intends to continue to seek to complete a Business Combination, such as the DePalma Business Combination (as defined in Note 6), before the mandatory liquidation date.

Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless. 
 In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per share of Class A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares or Private Placement Units (or underlying securities) held by the Sponsor or its affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the market value of Class A common stock (the Market Value is below per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.

 Since the Company s registration statement became effective on September 30, 2021, it was required to complete an initial business combination by no later than September 30, 2024. The Rule also provides that failure to comply with this requirement will result in the Listing Qualifications Department issuing a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist the Company s securities. The Listing Qualifications Department has advised the Company that its securities would be subject to delisting unless the Company timely requests a hearing before an independent Hearings Panel (the Panel ). Accordingly, the Company has timely requested a hearing, which is currently scheduled for November 19, 2024. The hearing request will stay any suspension or delisting action pending the completion of the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. There can be no assurance that the hearing before the Panel will be successful.

The Conversion Shares will be identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Private Placement Units. The Conversion Shares are entitled to the registration rights set forth in the October 2024 Note.

For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s final prospectus for its initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on April 1, 2024. The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov . Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 10, 2020 for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the remaining proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted new rules and regulations for special purpose acquisition companies SPACs ), which became effective on July 1, 2024 (the 2024 SPAC Rules ). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC sponsors and related persons; (ii) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions; (iii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iv) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions; and (v) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. Recent Developments On October 1, 2024, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that the Company was not in compliance with Listing Rule IM-5101-2 (the Rule ), which requires that a SPAC complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with its initial public offering. Since the Company s registration statement became effective on September 30, 2021, it was required to complete an initial business combination by no later than September 30, 2024. The Rule also provides that failure to comply with this requirement will result in the Listing Qualifications Department issuing a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist the Company s securities. The Listing Qualifications Department has advised the Company that its securities would be subject to delisting unless the Company timely requests a hearing before an independent Hearings Panel (the Panel ). Accordingly, the Company has timely requested a hearing, which is currently scheduled for November 19, 2024. The hearing request will stay any suspension or delisting action pending the completion of the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. There can be no assurance that the hearing before the Panel will be successful. On October 22, 2024, we issued a promissory note (the October 2024 Note in the principal amount of up to 250,000 to Marblegate Special Opportunities Master Fund, L.P., a member of the Company s sponsor Marblegate SOMF ). The October 2024 Note was issued in connection with advances Marblegate SOMF has made, and may make in the future, to the Company for working capital expenses. The October 2024 Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. At the election of Marblegate SOMF, all or a portion of the unpaid principal amount of the October 2024 Note may be converted into shares of Class A common stock of the Company (the Conversion Shares ), equal to: (x) the portion of the principal amount of the October 2024 Note being converted, divided by (y) 10.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. The Conversion Shares will be identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the units issued by the Company to its sponsor and the representative of the underwriters in a private placement in connection with the Company s Initial Public Offering. The Conversion Shares are entitled to the registration rights set forth in the October 2024 Note.

Extension of Combination Period We originally had up to 15 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or until January 5, 2023 (the Combination Period ), to consummate an initial Business Combination. However, at our special meeting in lieu of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders held on December 2, 2022 First Extension Meeting ), our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the end of the Combination Period from January 5, 2023 to July 5, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors). In connection with the First Extension Meeting, stockholders holding 28,989,609 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company s trust account (the Trust Account ). As a result, approximately 293.5 million (approximately 10.12 per public share) was removed from the Trust Account and paid to such holders on December 2, 2022. On June 27, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the Second Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s stockholders approved a second amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination by an additional six (6) months, from July 5, 2023 to January 5, 2024, or such earlier date as determined by the board. In connection with the Second Extension Meeting, stockholders holding 244,327 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately 2.5 million (approximately 10.29 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders on July 4, 2023. On December 19, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the Third Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s stockholders approved a third amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination for an additional nine (9) months, from January 5, 2024 to October 5, 2024, or such earlier date as determined by the board. In connection with the Third Extension Meeting, stockholders holding 128,459 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately 1.4 million (approximately 10.62 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders on December 22, 2023. Following redemptions and as of December 31, 2023, the Company has 637,605 public shares outstanding. On September 10, 2024, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the Fourth Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s stockholders approved a fourth amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from October 5, 2024 to April 5, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors (the Fourth Extension Amendment ). In connection with the Fourth Extension Amendment, stockholders holding 268,726 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately 2.9 million (approximately 10.90 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company has 368,879 public shares outstanding.

Founder Conversion On June 28, 2023, we issued 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock to the Sponsor, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of Class B common stock held by the Sponsor (the Founder Conversion ). The 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the Founder Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the shares of Class B common stock before the Founder Conversion, including, among others, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial Business Combination; consequently, the shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the Founder Conversion are not registered under the Securities Act and remain unregistered until registration is demanded by the Sponsor pursuant to a letter agreement we entered into with our Sponsor, officers and directors. Following the Founder Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the extensions, (i) there were 4,368,879 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding and 6,303,333 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding, and (ii) the Sponsor held 96.5 of the outstanding shares of common stock. DePalma Business Combination On February 14, 2023, we entered into a Business Combination agreement (as it may be amended or restated from time to time, the DePalma Business Combination Agreement ), with Marblegate Asset Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Marblegate ), Marblegate Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation New MAC ), MAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New MAC Merger Sub ), DePalma Acquisition I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company DePalma I ), and DePalma Acquisition II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company DePalma II, and together with DePalma I, DePalma ), pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to combine with DePalma in a series of transactions that will result in New MAC becoming a publicly-traded company whose shares are expected to trade on The Nasdaq Global Market (the DePalma Business Combination ). Pursuant to the DePalma Business Combination Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, among other things: 

(i) 
 immediately prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the DePalma Business Combination Agreement, New MAC and DePalma will effect a series of reorganization transactions, resulting in DePalma becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of New MAC; 

(ii) 
 Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of New MAC, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the DePalma Business Combination Agreement (the DePalma Merger and 

(iii) 
 upon the effectiveness of the DePalma Merger (the Effective Time ), (x) each share of Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share consideration allocable to each share of our common stock (the Company Per Share Consideration (y) each share of Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Company Per Share Consideration, and (z) each warrant of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive one warrant of New MAC, with New MAC assuming our obligations under the existing warrant agreement. The Business Combination is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 following the receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals and the fulfilment of other customary closing conditions. For a full description of the DePalma Business Combination Agreement and the proposed DePalma Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business in the 2023 Annual Report. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from December 10, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments held in the Trust Account established for the benefit of our public stockholders with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company Continental acting as trustee. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence and other expenses in connection with searching for and completing a Business Combination. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 565,795, which consists of operating costs of 604,684 and provision for income tax of 32,101, offset by interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of 69,716 and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,274. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 885,983, which consists of operating and formation costs of 960,044, provision for income taxes of 20,299 and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 9,100, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 103,460. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 1,712,708, which consists of change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 8,100, operating costs of 1,859,846 and provision for income tax of 62,635, offset by interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of 217,873. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 4,399,048, which consists of operating and formation costs of 4,655,422, provision for income taxes of 60,141 and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 15,470, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 331,985. Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions,

declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, political events such as the U.S. 2024 presidential and congressional elections, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern On October 5, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 30,000,000 units, generating gross proceeds of 300,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 910,000 private placement units at a price of 10.00 per private placement unit in the private placement, generating gross proceeds of 9,100,000. Following the Initial Public Offering and the private placement, a total of 301,500,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 42,630,587 in Initial Public Offering related costs, including 6,000,000 of underwriting fees, 15,000,000 of deferred underwriting fees, net of reimbursement, 1,015,137 of other offering costs including 509,600 for the fair value of the private placement warrants included in the private placement units, and 505,537 of offering costs, and 20,615,450 for the fair value of the Founder Shares attributable to certain anchor investors. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 914,690. Net loss of 1,712,708 was affected by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 217,873 and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 8,100. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 1,007,791 of cash from operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 2,284,473. Net loss of 4,399,048 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 331,985 and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 15,470. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 2,431,090 of cash from operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 4,028,377 (including 321,143 of interest income) consisting of investments in money market funds. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not withdraw any interest income from the Trust Account to pay franchise and income taxes or in connection with redemptions. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. In November 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank, with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and private placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 96,701 outside of the Trust Account. We have used and intend to continue to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to complete a Business Combination, such as the DePalma Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us working capital loans, as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay any working capital loans. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay any working capital loans but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. On June 30, 2022, we issued a promissory note (the 2022 Promissory Note to Marblegate SOMF, for a working capital loan for which we may borrow up to the principal sum of 600,000. On July 1, 2022, February 2, 2023 and February 8, 2023, we borrowed 200,000, 200,000 and 200,000 under the 2022 Promissory Note, respectively. On February 13, 2023, the Company issued an additional promissory note (the 2023 Promissory Note to Marblegate SOMF in the amount of 1,100,000. On July 20, 2023, the Company issued an additional promissory note (the July 2023 Note to Marblegate SOMF in the amount of 500,000. On December 21, 2023, the Company issued another promissory note in the principal amount of up to 450,000 to Marblegate SOMF (the December 2023 Promissory Note ). On April 11, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note (the April 2024 Promissory Note in the principal amount of up to 240,000 to Marblegate SOMF. On July 18, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note (the July 2024 Note in the principal amount of up to 255,000 to Marblegate SOMF. On October 22, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note (the October 2024 Note in the principal amount of up to 250,000 to Marblegate SOMF. Each of the 2022 Promissory Note, the 2023 Promissory Note, the July 2023 Note, the December 2023 Promissory Note, the April 2024 Promissory Note the July 2024 Note and the October 2024 Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. At the election of the payee, all or a portion of the unpaid principal amount of the note may be converted into Conversion Shares, equal to: (x) the portion of the principal amount of the note being converted, divided by (y) 10.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. The Conversion Shares will be identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the units issued by the Company to its Sponsor and the representative of the underwriters in a private placement in connection with the Company s Initial Public Offering. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, including the DePalma Business Combination, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 3,070,000 and 2,225,000 are outstanding on the working capital loans, respectively. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. We will likely need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Our officers, directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet our working capital needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable

terms, if at all. If we are unable to complete the Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU Topic 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, we have until April 5, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors), to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date and an extension has not been requested by the Sponsor and approved by our stockholders, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity issue and the mandatory liquidation raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be required to liquidate after April 5, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors). We intend to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement pay the Sponsor a total of up to 10,000 per month for secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on September 30, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 5.0 of the gross proceeds of the initial 30,000,000 units sold in the Initial Public Offering, or 15,000,000. The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On August 11, 2023, the Company entered into a fee reduction agreement with the underwriters whereby the underwriters agreed to forfeit 12,000,000 of the aggregate 15,000,000 deferred fee contingent upon the consummation of the DePalma Business Combination. The reduced deferred fee of 3,000,000 shall be payable on the consummation of the DePalma Business Combination, as contemplated by the underwriting agreement. If the contemplated DePalma Business Combination is not completed, and the Company completes a Business Combination with another target, the deferred underwriting fee due would then revert to the original amount of 15,000,000. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Warrant Liabilities We account for the warrants issued in connection with our Initial Public Offering in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC Topic 815-40-15-7D, Derivatives and Hedging ), under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, we classify the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until the private placement warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in our statements of operations. Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A common stock (including Class A common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of our condensed balance sheets. Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock Net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating loss per share. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Recent Accounting Standards In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current principal executive officer and principal financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this report. For additional risks relating to our operations, other than as set forth below, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our (i) final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering, (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, (iii) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 14, 2024, and (iv) Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as filed with the SEC on August 26, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. For risks related to DePalma and the DePalma Business Combination, please see the registration statement in connection with the DePalma Business Combination once filed. We have received notice from Nasdaq stating that the Company is not in compliance with Listing Rule IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with its initial public offering. If we cannot regain compliance, our securities will be subject to delisting and the liquidity and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected. On October 1, 2024, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with Listing Rule IM-5101-2 (the Rule ), which requires that a special purpose acquisition company SPAC complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with its initial public offering. Since the Company s registration statement became effective on September 30, 2021, it was required to complete an initial business combination by no later than September 30, 2024. The Rule also provides that failure to comply with this requirement will result in the Listing Qualifications Department issuing a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist the Company s securities. The Listing Qualifications Department has advised the Company that its securities would be subject to delisting unless the Company timely requests a hearing before an independent Hearings Panel (the Panel ). Accordingly, the Company has timely requested a hearing, which is currently scheduled for November 19, 2024. The hearing request will stay any suspension or delisting action pending the completion of the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. There can be no assurance that the hearing before the Panel will be successful. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

appearing to be less attractive to potential target companies than an exchange listed SPAC; 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our securities; 

a determination that our Class A common stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, if our securities are delisted from Nasdaq, offers and sales of our securities by us may be subject to state securities regulation and additional compliance costs.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Use of Proceeds For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering and private placement, see Part II, Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2021. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and private placement as described in the IPO Registration Statement. The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time. Issuer Purchases of Securities On September 10, 2024, we held the Fourth Extension Meeting, at which the Company s stockholders approved the Fourth Extension Amendment, which extended the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from October 5, 2024 to April 5, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors. In connection with the Fourth Extension Amendment, stockholders holding 268,726 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately 2.9 million (approximately 10.90 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. The following table contains monthly information about the repurchases of our equity securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024:
