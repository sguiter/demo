The Company will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than (so that it does not then become subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Articles of Association will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Articles of Association (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. If the Company has not completed a Business Combination within from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering) (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not

Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

In connection with the initial business combination, the Company may enter into a shareholders agreement or other arrangements with the shareholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of this offering. The Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a -for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, of the sum of (i) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon completion of the Initial Public Offering, plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, plus (iii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business Combination (including securities issued or issuable pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements the Company may enter into prior to or following consummation of this offering but excluding the forward purchase warrants), excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of working capital loans, minus (iv) the number of Class A ordinary shares redeemed by public shareholders; provided that such conversion of founder shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. warrants outstanding, including Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC, and will use its best efforts to have declared effective within business days following the closing of its Business Combination, a registration statement covering the issuance of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

 Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants: in whole and not in part; at a price of per Public Warrant; upon a minimum of prior written notice of redemption, or the - day redemption period to each warrant holder; and if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and for certain issuances of ordinary shares and equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the completion of the initial business combination as described elsewhere in this prospectus) (which is referred to as the Reference Value for any trading days within a - trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 The Company will not redeem the Public Warrants for cash unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the -day redemption period or the Company has elected to require the exercise of the public warrants on a cashless basis. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, it may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, the Company may redeem warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption as described above, the Company will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise such warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value (as defined below) of the shares of Class A ordinary shares over the exercise price of the public warrants by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value means the volume weighted average price of the Class A ordinary shares as reported during the (10) trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holder of the public warrants or its securities broker or intermediary. The Private Placement Warrants is identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable, except as described above, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.

 The following table presents information about the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on August 29, 2024, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: Equity: Fair value of Public Warrants for Class A ordinary shares subject to redemption allocation 3 The over-allotment option was accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 815-40 and was presented within liabilities on the balance sheet. The over-allotment option liability is measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of over-allotment option liability in the statement of operations. Upon the partially exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters on September 26, 2024, the Company recorded unrealized gain on change in fair value of over-allotment liability. The Company used a Black-Scholes model to value the over-allotment option. The over-allotment option liability was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs inherent in pricing models are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary share based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the option. The expected life of the option is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The key inputs into the Black-Scholes model were as follows at initial measurement of the over-allotment option: Expected term (years) Expected volatility Exercise price Fair value of over-allotment Unit The following table provides a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Change in fair value of over-allotment option liability ) Partially exercise of over-allotment option at September 26, 2024 ) Forfeiture of over-allotment option at September 26, 2024 )

Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on May 9, 2024 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from May 9, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering (the IPO ), described below, and after closing of the IPO, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 711,859, which consisted of change on over-allotment liability of 221,227 and interest earned on cash held in Trust Account of 675,282, partially offset by general and administrative cost of 184,650. For the period from May 9, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, we had net income of 658,680, which consisted of change on over-allotment liability of 221,227 and interest earned on cash held in Trust Account of 675,282, partially offset by general administrative cost of 237,829.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of shares of Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, by the Sponsor and loans from the Sponsor. On August 29, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 150,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of an aggregate of 11,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 5,500,000. On September 26, 2024, the underwriters purchased an additional 300,000 Units pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment Option. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of 3,000,000. In connection with the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 120,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of 0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of 60,000. Following the Initial Public Offering, the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Units, a total of 153,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 7,395,804 in transaction costs, consisting of 2,660,000 of cash underwriting fee (net of 400,000 underwriters reimbursement), 4,257,000 of deferred underwriting fee, and 478,804 of other offering costs. For the period from May 9, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 259,843. Net income of 658,680 was affected by interest earned on cash held in Trust Account of 675,282, payment of formation costs through promissory note of 58,059 and change in fair value of over-allotment liability of 221,227. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 80,073 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 153,675,282 (including 675,282 of interest income). We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2,128,294 for working capital purpose. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 2,000,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of 0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to an affiliate of the Sponsor 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the management team. We began incurring these fees on August 23, 2024 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from May 9, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 26,000 in administrative support services fee, respectively, of which such amount is included in due to related party in the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheet. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On September 26, 2024, the underwriters purchased an additional 300,000 Units pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option. The underwriters have forfeited the remaining option to purchase the 1,950,000 Units. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates: Derivative Financial Instruments The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the condensed statement of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the condensed balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The underwriters over-allotment option is deemed to be a freestanding financial instrument indexed on the contingently redeemable shares and was accounted for as a liability pursuant to ASC 480.

 Warrant Instruments The Company accounts for the Public and Private Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Accordingly, the Company evaluated and classified the warrant instruments under equity treatment at their assigned values. The fair value of Public Warrants was determined using Monte Carlo Simulation Model. The Public Warrants have been classified within shareholders deficit and will not require remeasurement after issuance. The key inputs used in the valuation of the Public Warrants are as follows: 

August 29, 2024 Underlying share price 10.00 Exercise price 11.50 Term (years) 6.0 Risk-free rate 3.7 Volatility 3.3 De-SPAC probability with market adjustment 20.0 Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our final prospectus for its Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for its Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. On August 29, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Units, generating gross proceeds of 150,000,000. Clear Street Cohen Company Capital Markets acted as joint book-running manager of the Initial Public Offering. The securities in the offering were registered under the Securities Act on registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-280385). The Securities and Exchange Commission declared the registration statements effective on August 23, 2024. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of an aggregate of 11,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 5,500,000. Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. On September 26, 2024, the underwriters purchased an additional 300,000 Units pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment Option. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of 3,000,000. In connection with the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 120,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of 0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of 60,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Warrants are not transferable, assignable or salable until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Of the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering, the partial exercise of the over-allotment option and the Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate of 153,000,000 was placed in the Trust Account. Transaction costs incurred amounted to 7,395,804, consisting of 2,660,000 of cash underwriting fee (net of 400,000 underwriters reimbursement), 4,257,000 of deferred underwriting fee, and 478,804 of other offering costs.
