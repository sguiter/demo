 Discounts to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. Premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized to first call date. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. If at any point the Company believes PIK interest or dividends are not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest or dividends will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest income. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.

 from the date it first became effective, and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (1) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities, and (2) the vote of a majority of the Company s directors who are not interested persons of the Company, of the Adviser or of any of their respective affiliates, as defined in the 1940 Act. On May 6, 2024, the Board approved the continuation of the Administration Agreement. The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on days written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, or by the vote of the Board or by the Adviser. 
 No person who is an officer, director, or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to the Company s Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company). Directors who are not affiliated with the Adviser receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred expenses of approximately million and million, respectively, for costs and expenses reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred expenses of approximately million and million, respectively, for costs and expenses reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. 
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for managing the Company s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring its investments, and monitoring its portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 The Adviser s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. 
 Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for from the date it first became effective, and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, by a majority of independent directors. On May 6, 2024, the Board approved the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment. In accordance with the 1940 Act, without payment of any penalty, the Company may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser upon days written notice. The decision to terminate the agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the shareholders holding a majority (as defined under the 1940 Act) of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock or the Adviser. In addition, without payment of any penalty, the Adviser may generally terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement upon days written notice and, in certain circumstances, the Adviser may only be able to terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement upon days written notice. 
 From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by the Company to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and the Company will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on its behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser a base management fee and may also pay to it certain incentive fees. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the Company s shareholders. 
 The management fee is currently payable quarterly in arrears. The management fee is payable at an annual rate of (x) of the Company s average gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) that is above an asset coverage ratio of calculated in accordance with Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act and (y) of the Company s average gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) that is below an asset coverage ratio of calculated in accordance with Section 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, in each case, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The management fee for any partial month or quarter, as the case may be, will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant calendar months or quarters, as the case may be.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

 million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, management fees were million and million, respectively. 
 The incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and a portion is based on the Company s capital gains. The portion of the incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears commencing with the first calendar quarter following the Listing Date, and equals of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of a quarterly hurdle rate, until the Adviser has received of the total pre-incentive fee net investment income for that calendar quarter and, for pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of quarterly, of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income for that calendar quarter. 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears, equals of cumulative realized capital gains from the Listing Date to the end of each calendar year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the Listing Date to the end of each calendar year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for prior periods. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, including Section 205 thereof. 
 While the Investment Advisory Agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, as required by U.S. GAAP, the Company accrues capital gains incentive fees on unrealized gains. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to the Adviser if the Company s entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though the Adviser is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million and million of performance based incentive fees based on net investment income, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred million and million of performance based incentive fees based on net investment income, respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not accrue capital gains based incentive fees. 
 The Company is seeking shareholder approval of a Fourth Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement (the "New Investment Advisory Agreement"). The New Investment Advisory Agreement would adjust the calculation of the incentive fee based on income to exclude any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or discount to interest income resulting solely from the purchase accounting for any purchase premium or discount paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger, such as the purchase premium or discount to NAV to be paid for shares of OBDE common stock in the Mergers and the calculation of the incentive fee based on capital gains will be adjusted to exclude realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation resulting solely from the purchase accounting for any purchase premium or discount paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger, including the Mergers. 
 For more information about the New Investment Advisory Agreement see the Company's joint proxy statement and prospectus filed with the SEC on October 21, 2024. 
 Affiliated Transactions 
 The Company may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with its affiliates without prior approval of the directors who are not interested persons, and in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. The Company, the Adviser and certain of their affiliates have been granted an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the Order by the SEC for the Company to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain affiliates in a manner consistent with the Company s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such Order, the Company generally is permitted to co-invest with certain of its affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching by the Company or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s shareholders and is consistent with its investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by its affiliates would not disadvantage the Company, and the Company s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which its affiliates are investing and (4) the proposed investment by the Company would not benefit the Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Order permits the Company to participate in follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds, if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company.

 The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing Level 3 debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to its total enterprise value, and the rights and remedies of the Company s investment within the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 When the debtor is not performing or when there is insufficient value to cover the investment, the Company may utilize a net recovery approach to determine the fair value of debt investments in subject companies. A net recovery analysis typically consists of two steps. First, the total enterprise value for the subject company is estimated using standard valuation approaches, most commonly the market approach. Second, the fair value for each investment in the subject company is then estimated by allocating the subject company s total enterprise value to the outstanding securities in the capital structure based upon various factors, including seniority, preferences, and other features if deemed relevant to each security in the capital structure. 
 Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 debt investments primarily include current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. For the Company s Level 3 equity investments, a market approach, based on comparable financial performance multiples such as publicly-traded company and comparable market transaction multiples of revenues, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), or some combination thereof and comparable market transactions typically would be used.

 Dividend Reinvestment 
 With respect to distributions, the Company has adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. If newly issued shares are used to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a shareholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, we will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii) 95 of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed net asset value per share). If shares are purchased in the open market to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the cash dividend payable to such shareholder by the weighted average price per share for all shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market in connection with the dividend. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.

 Overview 
 Blue Owl Capital Corporation (the Company , we , us or our is a Maryland corporation formed on October 15, 2015. We were formed primarily to originate and make loans to, and make debt and equity investments in, U.S. middle market companies. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company s common equity. Our investment objective is to generate current income, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. 
 We are managed by Blue Owl Credit Advisors LLC the Adviser or our Adviser ). The Adviser is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), an indirect affiliate of Blue Owl Capital Inc. ("Blue Owl") (NYSE: OWL) and part of Blue Owl s Credit platform, which focuses on direct lending. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors the Board or our Board ), the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. The Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 On July 22, 2019, we closed our initial public offering IPO and our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE on July 18, 2019. Since July 6, 2023, our common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol "OBDC." 
 The Adviser also serves as investment adviser to Blue Owl Capital Corporation II and Blue Owl Credit Income Corp. 
 Blue Owl consists of three investment platforms: (1) Credit, which focuses on direct lending, (2) GP Strategic Capital, which focuses on acquiring equity stakes in and providing debt financing to institutional alternative asset managers, and (3) Real Estate, which focuses on triple net lease real estate strategies and real estate credit. Blue Owl s Credit platform is comprised of the Adviser, Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors LLC OTCA ), Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors II LLC OTCA II ), Blue Owl Credit Private Fund Advisors LLC OPFA and Blue Owl Diversified Credit Advisors LLC ODCA and together with the Adviser, OTCA, OTCA II, and OPFA, the Blue Owl Credit Advisers ), which also are registered investment advisers. As of September 30, 2024, the Adviser and its affiliates had 128.44 billion of assets under management across Blue Owl s Credit platform. 
 The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of the Adviser and the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. The Investment Team is led by Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer and is supported by certain members of the Adviser's senior executive team and Blue Owl s Credit platform s investment committees. Blue Owl s Credit platform has four investment committees each of which focuses on a specific investment strategy (Diversified Lending, Technology Lending, First Lien Lending and Opportunistic Lending). Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz, Craig W. Packer and Alexis Maged sit on each of Blue Owl s Credit platform s investment committees. In addition to Messers. Ostrover, Lipschultz, Packer and Maged, the Diversified Lending Investment Committee is comprised of Patrick Linnemann, Meenal Mehta and Logan Nicholson. We consider the individuals on the Diversified Lending Investment Committee to be our portfolio managers.The Investment Team, under the Diversified Lending Investment Committee's supervision, sources investment opportunities, conducts research, performs due diligence on potential investments, structures our investments and will monitor our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. 
 The Diversified Lending Investment Committee meets regularly to consider our investments, direct our strategic initiatives and supervise the actions taken by the Adviser on our behalf. In addition, the Diversified Lending Investment Committee reviews and determines whether to make prospective investments (including approving parameters or guidelines pursuant to which investments in broadly syndicated loans may be bought and sold), structures financings and monitors the performance of the investment portfolio. Each investment opportunity requires the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies may require the Diversified Lending Investment Committee's approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the portfolio company was made. In addition, temporary investments, such as those in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, may require approval by the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. The compensation packages of certain Diversified Lending Investment Committee members from the Adviser include various combinations of discretionary bonuses and variable incentive compensation based primarily on performance for services provided and may include shares of Blue Owl. 
 124 

We may be prohibited under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We, our Adviser and certain affiliates have been granted an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the Order by the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to the Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit our Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. 
 In addition, the Order permits us to continue to co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. 
 The Blue Owl Credit Advisers investment allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities over time between us and other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the Order, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of the business development companies BDCs ), private funds and separately managed accounts managed by the Blue Owl Credit Advisers (collectively, the Blue Owl Credit Clients and/or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the Order and that have an investment objective similar to ours. 
 On April 27, 2016, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending LLC makes loans to borrowers headquartered in California. From time to time we may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate our normal course of business. 
 Certain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a regulated investment company RIC for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as: 
 the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets , as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; 
 source of income limitations; 
 asset diversification requirements; and 
 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90 of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. 
 Pending Merger with Blue Owl Capital Corporation III 
 On August 7, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Blue Owl Capital Corporation III, a Maryland corporation OBDE ), Cardinal Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of OBDC Merger Sub ), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Adviser, and ODCA, investment adviser to OBDE.

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of September 30, 2024, 96.3 of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly. 
 Our investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and any alternative reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends. Generally, because our portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, we expect our earnings to benefit from a prolonged higher rate environment. 
 Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. 
 Dividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies. 
 Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, the incentive fee, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating expenses. The management fee and incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments. 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear our allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iii) all other costs and expenses of its operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to: 
 the cost of our organization and offerings; 
 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 
 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; 
 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; 
 127 

debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 
 costs of hedging; 
 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 
 transfer agent and custodial fees; 
 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 
 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; 
 federal, state and local taxes; 
 independent directors fees and expenses including certain travel expenses; 
 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; 
 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 
 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 
 research and market data; 
 fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 
 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 
 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; 
 costs of winding up; 
 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; 
 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and 
 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. 
 We expect, but cannot assure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods. 
 Leverage 
 The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. Generally, our total borrowings are limited so that we cannot incur additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt securities, if such additional indebtedness would cause our asset coverage ratio to fall below 200 or 150 , if certain requirements are met. This means that generally, 1 for every 1 of investor equity (or, if certain conditions are met, we can borrow up to 2 for every 1 of investor equity). In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing, and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our debt outstanding. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities. On June 8, 2020, we received shareholder approval for the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, effective on June 9, 2020, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities was reduced from 200 to 150 . Our current target leverage ratio is 0.90x-1.25x. 
 Market Trends 
 We believe the middle-market lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Limited Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. The middle-market is a large addressable market. According to GE Capital s National Center for the Middle Market Mid-Year 2024 Middle Market Indicator, there are approximately 200,000 U.S. middle-market companies, which have approximately 48 million aggregate employees. Moreover, the U.S. middle-market accounts for one-third of private sector gross domestic product GDP ). GE defines U.S. middle-market companies as those between 10 million and 1 billion in annual revenue, which we believe has significant overlap with our definition of U.S. middle-market companies. We believe U.S. middle-market companies will continue to require access to debt capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. We believe that regulatory and structural factors, industry consolidation and general risk aversion, limit the amount of traditional financing available to U.S. middle-market companies. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of 
 128 

lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans and high yield securities for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of market participants that are willing to hold meaningful amounts of certain middle-market loans. As a result, we believe our ability to minimize syndication risk for a company seeking financing by being able to hold its loans without having to syndicate them, coupled with reduced capacity of traditional lenders to serve the middle-market, present an attractive opportunity to invest in middle-market companies. 
 Capital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void in U.S. Middle Market Finance Left by Banks . Access to underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets is challenging for middle-market companies due to loan issue size and liquidity. For example, high yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors, such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds ETFs who, among other things, are focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities initial investment decision. Syndicated loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and tenor, otherwise known as flex , to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Furthermore, banks are generally reluctant to underwrite middle-market loans because the arrangement fees they may earn on the placement of the debt generally are not sufficient to meet the banks return hurdles. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets, and we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis. In addition, our Adviser has teams focused on both liquid credit and private credit and these teams are able to collaborate with respect to syndicated loans. 
 Secular Trends Supporting Growth for Private Credit. We believe that periods of market volatility, such as the current period of market volatility caused, in part, by uncertainty regarding inflation and interest rates, and current geopolitical conditions, have accentuated the advantages of private credit. The availability of capital in the liquid credit market is highly sensitive to market conditions whereas we believe private lending has proven to be a stable and reliable source of capital through periods of volatility. We believe the opportunity set for private credit will continue to expand even as the public markets remain open. Financial sponsors and companies today are familiar with direct lending and have seen firsthand the strong value proposition that a private solution can offer. Scale, certainty of execution and flexibility all provide borrowers with a compelling alternative to the syndicated and high yield markets. Based on our experience, there is an emerging trend where higher quality credits that have traditionally been issuers in the syndicated and high yield markets are increasingly seeking private solutions independent of credit market conditions. In our view, this is supported by financial sponsors wanting to work with collaborative financing partners that have scale and breadth of capabilities. We believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms broadly, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be 2.7 trillion as of December 31, 2023, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that private equity sponsors will continue to pursue acquisitions and leverage their equity investments with secured loans provided by companies such as us. 
 Attractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. We believe the directly negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender-protective change of control provisions. Additionally, we believe BDC managers expertise in credit selection and ability to manage through credit cycles has generally resulted in BDCs experiencing lower loss rates than U.S. commercial banks through credit cycles. Further, we believe that historical middle-market default rates have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the larger market capitalization, broadly distributed market, leading to lower cumulative losses. Lastly, we believe that in the current environment, lenders with available capital may be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as the economy reopens and may be able to achieve improved economic spreads and documentation terms. 
 Conservative Capital Structures. Following the global credit crisis, which we define broadly as occurring between mid-2007 and mid-2009, lenders have generally required borrowers to maintain more equity as a percentage of their total capitalization, specifically to protect lenders during economic downturns. With more conservative capital structures, U.S. middle-market companies have exhibited higher levels of cash flows available to service their debt. In addition, U.S. middle-market companies often are characterized by simpler capital structures than larger borrowers, which facilitates a streamlined underwriting process and, when necessary, restructuring process. 

129 

Attractive Opportunities in Investments in Loans. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities. We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. We believe that debt issues with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer s security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer s assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default. 
 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 75.9 first lien senior secured debt investments (of which 51.0 we consider to be unitranche debt investments (including last out portions of such loans)), 5.4 second lien senior secured debt investments, 2.3 unsecured debt investments, 2.9 preferred equity investments, 10.6 common equity investments and 2.9 joint ventures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 11.0 and 11.1 , respectively, and our weighted average yield of accruing debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 11.5 and 11.6 , respectively. Refer to our weighted average yields and interest rates table for more information on our calculation of weighted average yields. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average spread of total debt investments was 6.4 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 219 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of 13.45 billion. As of September 30, 2024 we had net leverage of 1.23x debt-to-equity, which is within our target range. 
 In the current lending environment, public loan markets have remained active while merger and acquisition activity remains below historical levels; however, our platform continues to find attractive investment opportunities for deployment, predominantly in first lien originations. In addition, a large portion of our originations across the platform this quarter were deployed into existing borrowers as part of add-on transactions. 
 The credit quality of our portfolio has been consistent. We continue to focus on investing in industries we view as recession resistant and that we are familiar with, including service-oriented sectors such as software and healthcare, all of which serve diversified and durable end markets. Blue Owl serves as the administrative agent on many of our investments and the majority of our investments are supported by sophisticated financial sponsors who provide operational and financial resources. Our borrowers have a weighted average EBITDA of 197 million and we believe this scale contributes to the durability of our borrowers and their ability to adapt to different economic environments. In addition, Blue Owl continues to invest in, and is often the lead lender or administrative agent on, transactions in excess of 1 billion in size, which gives us the ability to structure the terms of such deals to maximize deal economics and credit protection. 
 Many of the companies in which we invest are continuing to see modest growth in both revenues and EBITDA. However, in the event of further geopolitical, economic and financial market instability, in the U.S. and elsewhere, it is possible that the results of some of the middle-market companies similar to those in which we invest could be challenged. While we are not seeing signs of an overall, broad deterioration in our results or those of our portfolio companies at this time, there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our future results. 
 We also continue to invest in Credit SLF and specialty financing portfolio companies, including Wingspire Capital Holdings LLC Wingspire ), Fifth Season Investments LLC Fifth Season ), LSI Financing DAC 1 LSI Financing ), and AAM Series 1.1 Rail and Domestic Intermodal Feeder, LLC and AAM Series 2.1 Aviation Feeder, LLC (collectively, Amergin AssetCo ). In the future we may invest through additional specialty finance portfolio companies, joint ventures, partnerships or other special purpose vehicles. These companies may use our capital to support acquisitions which could continue to lead to increased dividend income supported by well-diversified underlying portfolios. See Specialty Financing Portfolio Companies and Joint Ventures.

 (1) For non-stated rate income producing investments, computed based on (a) the dividend or interest income earned for the respective trailing twelve months ended on the measurement date, divided by (b) the ending fair value. In instances where historical dividend or interest income data is not available or not representative for the trailing twelve months ended, the dividend or interest income is annualized. 
 The weighted average yield of our accruing debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders but, rather, relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. 
 Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 
 review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
 An investment will be placed on the Adviser's credit watch list when select events occur and will only be removed from the watch list with oversight of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee and/or other Blue Owl agent. Once an investment is on the credit watch list, the Adviser works with the borrower to resolve any financial stress through amendments, waivers or other alternatives. If a borrower defaults on its payment obligations, the Adviser's focus shifts to capital recovery. If an investment needs to be restructured, the Adviser s workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio 
 134 

investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 Investment Rating Description 1 Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable; 
 2 Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2; 
 3 Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition; 
 4 Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due); and 
 5 Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 Our Adviser rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 The Adviser has built out its portfolio management team to include workout experts who closely monitor our portfolio companies and who, on at least a quarterly basis, assess each portfolio company s operational and liquidity exposure and outlook to understand and mitigate risks; and, on at least a monthly basis, evaluates existing and newly identified situations where operating results are deviating from expectations. As part of its monitoring process, the Adviser focuses on projected liquidity needs and where warranted, re-underwriting credits and evaluating downside and liquidation scenarios. 
 The Adviser focuses on downside protection by leveraging existing rights available under our credit documents; however, for investments that are significantly underperforming or which may need to be restructured, the Adviser s workout team partners with the Investment Team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. As of September 30, 2024, only five of our portfolio companies are on non-accrual. Our annual gain/loss ratio is approximately (0.19) .

 135 

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. For the period ended September 30, 2024, our net asset value per share decreased, primarily driven by decreases in the fair value of certain debt investments.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income increased to 406.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 399.0 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to an increase in dividend income, partially offset by a decrease in the yield of our debt investment portfolio from 11.8 to 11.0 period over period. Fees received from unscheduled paydowns increased to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.9 million for the same period in prior year due to an increase in repayment activity for the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, payment-in-kind income represented 13.5 and 12.7 of investment income, respectively. Dividend income increased to 46.8 million from 41.4 million in the prior period, primarily due to an increase in dividends earned from our controlled, affiliated and non-controlled, affiliated equity investments. Other income increased period over period due to an increase in incremental fee income, which are fees that are generally available to us as a result of closing investments and normally paid at the time of closing. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income increased to 1,202.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,170.9 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to an increase in dividend income and an increase in prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns (which are non-recurring in nature), partially offset by a decrease in the yield of our debt investment portfolio from 11.8 to 11.0 period over period. Fees received from unscheduled paydowns increased 
 147 

to 27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.9 million for the same period in prior year due to an increase in repayment activity for the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, payment-in-kind income represented 13.3 and 13.4 of investment income, respectively. Dividend income increased to 148.0 million from 119.7 million in the prior period, primarily due to an increase in dividends earned from our controlled, affiliated and non-controlled, affiliated equity investments. Other income increased period over period due to an increase in incremental fee income, which are fees that are generally available to us as a result of closing investments and normally paid at the time of closing. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total expenses increased for the period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in prior year, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. Interest expense increased due to an increase in average interest rate period over period from 5.6 to 5.8 and an increase in daily average borrowings from 7.3 billion to 7.9 billion. As a percentage of total assets, management fees, incentive fees, professional fees, directors fees and other general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent period over perio d. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total expenses increased to 634.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 607.8 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in the average interest rate to 5.7 from 5.4 period over period and an increase in the average daily borrowings to 7.5 billion from 7.4 billion period over period. As a percentage of total assets, management fees, incentive fees, professional fees, directors fees and other general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent period over perio d. 
 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. In addition, a RIC may, in certain cases, satisfy this distribution requirement by distributing dividends relating to a taxable year after the close of such taxable year under the spillover dividend provisions of subchapter M. As of September 30, 2024 we have generated undistributed taxable earnings spillover of approximately 0.41 per share. The undistributed taxable earnings spillover will be carried forward toward distributions to be paid in accordance with RIC requirements. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded U.S. federal income tax expense/(benefit) of 3.6 million and 11.2 million, respectively, including U.S. federal excise tax expense/(benefit) of 1.7 million and 5.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded U.S. federal income tax expense/(benefit) of 
 148 

2.7 million and 8.5 million, respectively, including U.S. federal excise tax expense/(benefit) of 0.9 million and 3.6 million, respectively. 
 Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a current net tax expense of approximately 0.4 million and 0.7 million for taxable subsidiaries, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a current net tax benefit of approximately (1.0) million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we did not record a current tax expense or benefit. The income tax expense for our taxable consolidated subsidiaries will vary depending on the level of investment income earnings and realized gains from the exits of investments held by such taxable subsidiaries during the respective periods. 
 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 We fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the following periods, net unrealized gains (losses) were:

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net unrealized gain was primarily driven by a decrease in the fair value of certain debt investments, offset by reversal of a prior period unrealized loss that was realized during the period in connection with the restructuring of a debt investment and increases in the fair value of certain equity investments.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net unrealized gain was primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of our debt investments as compared to December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal was 97.6 , as compared to 97.0 as of December 31, 2022.

 Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return 
 Since we began investing in 2016 through September 30, 2024, our exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 10 (based on total capital invested of 15.63 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of 19.07 billion. 
 IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited. 
 Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. 
 Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees (except upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of an investment), administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. 
 Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our shareholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero. 
 151 

Gross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of management fees, expenses, incentive fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our shareholders, and would be lower if it did. 
 Aggregate cash flow realized gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments, our credit facilities, debt securitization transactions, and other secured and unsecured debt. We may also generate cash flow from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities including public and/or private issuances of debt and/or equity securities through both registered offerings off of our shelf registration statement and private offerings. The primary uses of our cash are (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying or reimbursing our Adviser), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities, enter into additional debt securitization transactions, or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . Our current target ratio is 0.90x-1.25x. As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average total cost of debt was 6.2 . In addition, from time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange debt securities in open market purchases or by other means, including privately negotiated transactions, in each case dependent on market conditions, liquidity, contractual obligations, and other matters. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 176 and 183 , respectively. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 Cash and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our available debt, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.62 billion available under our credit facilities. 
 Our long-term cash needs will include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and funding of additional portfolio investments. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from unused net proceeds from financing activities. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term cash requirements. We cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to us in sufficient amounts in the future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 481.3 million in cash and restricted cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 285.7 million in cash was used in operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of 3.75 billion offset by sell downs and repayments of 3.11 billion and other operating activity of 355.8 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was 107.4 million during the period, which was primarily the result of net borrowings on debt of 622.4 million partially offset by distributions paid of 491.7 million and debt issuance costs of 23.3 million.

Distributions 
 The following tables present the distributions declared on shares of the Company s common stock for the following periods:

 During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year, a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the tax character of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders. The tax character of the distributions are not determined until our taxable year end. 
 Dividend Reinvestment 
 Pursuant to our second amended and restated dividend reinvestment plan, we will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their distribution in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Any fractional share otherwise issuable to a participant in the dividend reinvestment plan will instead be paid in cash. 
 If newly issued shares are used to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a shareholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, we will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii) 95 of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed net asset value per share). For example, if the most recently computed net asset value per share is 15.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is 16.00 per share, we will issue shares at 15.20 per share (95 of the current market price). If the most recently computed net asset value per share is 15.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is 15.50 per share, we will issue shares at 15.00 per share, as net asset value is greater than 95 14.73 per share) of the current market price. Pursuant to our second amended and restated dividend reinvestment plan, if shares are purchased in the open market to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the cash dividend payable to such shareholder by the weighted average price per share for all shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market in connection with the dividend. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5, the Board designated the Adviser as the Company's valuation designee to perform fair value determinations relating to the value of assets held by the Company for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the average bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as the valuation designee, based on, among other things, independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of our Adviser. 
 As part of the valuation process, our Adviser, as the valuation designee takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 Our Adviser, as the valuation designee, undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the average bid price of those market quotations; 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser s valuation committee; 
 Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser s valuation committee; 
 Our Adviser, as the valuation designee, reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; 
 Each quarter, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, provides the Audit Committee a summary or description of material fair value matters that occurred in the prior quarter and on an annual basis, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, will provide the Audit Committee with a written assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of its fair value process; and 
 The Audit Committee oversees the valuation designee and will report to the Board on any valuation matters requiring the Board s attention. 
 We conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis. 
 We apply ASC 820, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are 
 184 

defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below: 
 Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, evaluates the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), our Adviser, as the valuation designee, subjects those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. 
 The Company applies the practical expedient provided by the ASC Topic 820 relating to investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). ASC Topic 820 permits an entity holding investments in certain entities that either are investment companies, or have attributes similar to an investment company, and calculate NAV per share or its equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure the fair value of such investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or its equivalent, without adjustment. Investments which are valued using NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy as per ASC Topic 820. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Financial and Derivative Instruments 
 Rule 18f-4 requires BDCs that use derivatives to, among other things, comply with a value-at-risk leverage limit, adopt a derivatives risk management program, and implement certain testing and board reporting procedures. Rule 18f-4 exempts BDCs that qualify as limited derivatives users from the aforementioned requirements, provided that these BDCs adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the BDC s derivatives risks and comply with certain recordkeeping requirements. Rule 18f-4 provides that a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Pursuant to Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. The Company currently qualifies as a limited derivatives user and expects to continue to do so. The Company has adopted a derivatives policy and complies with the recordkeeping requirements of Rule 18f-4. 
 Interest and Dividend Income Recognition 
 Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization and accretion of discounts or premiums. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends, the majority of which is structured at initial underwriting. PIK interest or dividends represent accrued interest or dividends that are added to the principal amount of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or at the occurrence of a liquidation event. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, PIK interest and PIK dividend income earned was 54.9 million and 159.8 million representing 13.5 and 13.3 of investment income, respectively. Discounts to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective 
 185 

yield method. Premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized to first call date. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. If at any point we believe PIK interest is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest income. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. 
 Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distributions for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our: 
 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and 
 net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. 
 As a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. 
 We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below. 
 Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; 
 98.2 of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and 
 100 of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. 
 While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders 
 186 

who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016 and intend to continue to qualify as a RIC. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as distributions. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In order for us to not be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4 nondeductible U.S. excise tax on this income. 
 Certain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2023. As applicable, our prior three tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities.

Recent Developments 
 Dividend 
 On November 5, 2024, our Board declared a fourth quarter dividend of 0.37 per share for stockholders of record as of December 31, 2024, payable on or before January 15, 2025 and a third quarter supplemental dividend of 0.05 per share for stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024, payable on or before December 13, 2024. 
 OBDC SLF Transaction 
 On November 1, 2024, the OBDC SLF Members authorized the liquidation over time of the assets of OBDC SLF and subsequent dissolution. We purchased a portion of OBDC SLF s portfolio with an aggregate fair market value of approximately 750 million for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 750 million. OBDC SLF intends to use a portion of these proceeds to fully repay and terminate its credit facilities. 
 Credit SLF Transaction 
 On November 1, 2024, certain Credit SLF Members, including us, increased their capital commitments to Credit SLF. Subsequently, Credit SLF delivered a capital call to certain of Credit SLF Members, including us, our portion of which is 750 million. We determined, and Credit SLF agreed, to allow us to make this capital contribution in-kind by delivering to Credit SLF the assets we purchased from OBDC SLF.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and inflation risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, as our valuation designee, based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Adviser, as our valuation designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 In a low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 96.3 of our debt investments based on fair value were floating rates. Additionally, the weighted average floor, based on fair value, of our debt investments was 0.8 and the majority of our debt investments have a floor of 1.0 . The Revolving Credit Facility and SPV Asset Facility II bear interest at variable interest rates with a floor of 0 . The 2025 Notes, July 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, July 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes bear interest at fixed rates. The 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes are hedged against interest rate swaps instruments. CLO III, CLO IV and CLO X bear interest at variables rates with a floor of 0 . CLO I, CLO II, CLO V and CLO VII bear interest at fixed and variable rates with a floor of 0 . 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments) assuming each floating rate investment is subject to 3-month reference rate election and there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 in millions) Interest Income Interest Expense (1) 
 Net Income (2) 
 Up 300 basis points 326,771 132,361 194,410 Up 200 basis points 217,847 88,241 129,606 Up 100 basis points 108,924 44,120 64,804 Down 100 basis points (108,924) (44,120) (64,804) Down 200 basis points (217,847) (88,241) (129,606) Down 300 basis points (326,768) (132,361) (194,407) 
 _____________ 
 (1) Includes the impact of our interest rate swaps as a result of interest rate changes. 
 (2) Excludes the impact of income based fees. See ITEM 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions of our consolidated financial statements for more information on the income based fees. 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates. 
 Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, borrow in certain foreign currencies under our credit facilities or issue notes in certain foreign currencies. These investments, borrowings and issuances are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts or cross currency swaps to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. Instead of entering into a foreign currency forward contract in connection with loans or other investments denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge 
 189 

against our loan, issuance or investment. To the extent the loan, issuance or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our credit facilities, we may utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. 
 Credit Risk 
 We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting to reputable financial institutions the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held the majority of our cash balances with a single highly rated money center bank and such balances are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We seek to mitigate this exposure by monitoring the credit standing of these financial institutions. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation is likely to continue in the near to medium-term, particularly in the United States, with the possibility that monetary policy may continue to tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies profit margins. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 190 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we nor the Adviser are currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Other than the shares issued pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, we did not sell any unregistered equity securities, except as previously disclosed in certain 8-Ks filed with the SEC. 
 In the third quarter 2024, pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, we purchased 559,631 shares of our common stock in the open market, at a weighted average price of 15.28 per share, for distribution to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2024 and September 1, 2024 for the second quarter dividend and supplemental second quarter dividend, respectively, that did not opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan in order to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our dividends. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable.
