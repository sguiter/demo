2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Back to Table of Contents 

Some
of the statements contained in this quarterly report of Data Call Technologies, Inc., Nevada corporation (hereinafter referred to as
 we , us , our , Company and the Registrant discuss future expectations,
contain projections of our plan of operation or financial condition or state other forward-looking information. Forward-looking statements
give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. They use of words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, 
 intend, plan, believe, and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance. From time to time, we also may provide forward-looking statements in other materials
we release to the public. 

Data
Call Technologies, Inc. Data Call, or the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada
as Data Call Wireless on April 4, 2002. On March 1, 2006, we changed our name to Data Call Technologies, Inc. 

Our
mission is to continue to exponentially grow our offering of our proprietary subscription services by integrating cutting-edge information/content
delivery solutions to and within the control of retail and commercial resellers CMS manufacturers and end-users. Our Company s
services put its clients in control of real-time news, sports, weather and other dynamic content, displayed within one or multiple locations,
spanning from local, regional to global end points, through Digital Signage and Kiosk networks. 

Our
business plan continues to focus on growing our client base by effectively offering this real-time and licensed information/content displayed
through Digital Signage and Kiosk networks, seeking to improve the delivery, security, and variety of information/content services to
the growing Digital Signage and Kiosk community. 

Overview
- What Is Digital Signage? 

You ve
seen Digital Signage, it s everywhere. Whether you re shopping, trying to find your way through the airport, in a taxi, or
even along the highway on your way home, it s there. LED and LCD displays are continually replacing printed marketing materials
such as signs and placards, as well as the old-school whiteboard, for product and corporate branding, marketing and assisted selling.
The appeal of instantly updating product videos and promotional messages on one or thousands of remotely located displays is driving
the adoption of this growing marketing platform. Digital Signage presentations are typically comprised of repeating loops (playlists)
of information used to brand, market or sell the owner s products and services or corporate messaging. But once viewed, this information
becomes repetitive and the viewer tunes it out, resulting in low retention of the client s message. As digital signage has matured,
the characteristics of the digital signage presentations have taken center-stage requiring fresh, relevant and dynamic content mixed
within the marketing messages. Dynamic Content is key. 

13 

Digital
Signage Matures 

We
are experiencing the Digital Signage Industry (back then called connected signage) steadily maturing and Data Call, through its multiple
industry specific relationships, continues its engagement and influence in the direction of the Digital Signage industry. Data Call has
been performing in this space for well over a decade. Our company has staked claim in assisting the industry s birth and maintains
its prime position to enjoy and benefit from this industry s growth. 

Early
on, a business desiring to achieve commercial benefits from the use of digital signage was often confronted by a plethora of hardware
and software solutions, all offering their own standard of what digital signage should be. Typical customers for digital
signage were most-often offered expensive hardware to present digital signage with a very minimalistic content management solution (CMS),
lacking the full package of content with which to build and tailor their systems for their target customer base. 

Those
early adopters of digital signage, often had to realize that their digital signage hardware vendors lacked the acumen to fully provide
best practice of content strategy. The tools to manage content were provided, but not the content. From our inception, Data Call recognized
that early signage providers and their typical customers lacked that key component - the offering of a comprehensive content package. 

As
the cost of platforms supporting infrastructure and digital displays have fallen significantly, digital signage has become more accessible
to a wider range of potential users. Companies in our industry have come to understand, as we have preached since our inception, that
the cost of Data Call s integrated, content-flexible subscription service is extremely cost effective - and licensed for redistribution
over their networks. The benefit that Data Call continues to provide our client base, in the form of ongoing content development, is
expected to continue to provide our customers with desirable user-friendly content and content services. 

The
Need for Speed - Active Content 

Active
and dynamic content is the integral part of digital signage presentations that must be constantly updated with timely and relevant information
to attract and retain target viewers to the products, services, or messaging offered by typical Digital Signage clients. For instance,
a typical presentation may contain ten 15-second loops that provide the primary message of the presentation, but the active dynamic content,
such as that provided by Data Call, is updated with new information constantly throughout the day. Those seeking to add active and dynamic
content to their digital signage presentations are educated and advised to subscribe to Data Call s dynamic content rather than
attempting to illegally cut and paste or scrape broadcast content or RSS Feeds not for commercial
use of others into their digital signage presentation. 

By
integrating Data Call s content as a meaningful component of digital signage presentations, our clients can legally provide the
entertainment and information content necessary to enhance the target customer s information retention without disrupting the core
message of the presentation. Some of the Infotainment categories provided by Data Call include news, sports, weather, financial data,
the latest traffic alerts, among many others. With such a broad range of offerings, our clients have access to this active and dynamic
content they need, regardless of the target customers and market they are addressing. 

Our
Business Opportunities 

Our
many opportunities for client development in the digital signage industry are growing exponentially. While many companies in our industry
have traditionally outsourced all or part of their content creation, Data Call serves as a provider of dynamic active content to clients
on a tailored basis. Whether a client desires general entertainment information for customers, such as news, sports, stock market quotes,
etc. or location-specific content, such as local weather, traffic, etc., our research and experience has validated our long-held mantra
that dynamic content draws and retains our clients target viewers to their digital signage and keeps viewers engaged throughout
the client presentation. 

Since
our inception, management has developed and maintains strong relationships working with the leaders and associations of the digital signage
industry. Collaborative efforts have successfully created, now industry standard, data formats and methods to facilitate the delivery
of our dynamic content more easily and efficiently for integration into most hardware and software products. 

14 

Partners,
Not Customers 

Data
Call s enduring approach to our clients is to build long-lasting partnerships by creating client relationships that we believe
are unique in the digital signage industry. We understand that each client has their own content requirements. In developing dynamic
content for individual digital signage clients, we have identified three content-related factors: (i) reliability; (ii) objectivity;
and (iii) ease of implementation. To address the reliability requirement, we are engaged in multiple license arrangements with the leading
providers of news, weather, sports and financial information, among other client-desired content rather than either: (i) downloading
and repackaging content sourced from the Internet (which may be illegal); or (ii) Scraping RSS feeds from news organizations (which may
come and go at the provider s whim - not to mention this practice is also illegal). 

Licensing
data from these premier providers has also served us by satisfying the second criteria, objectivity. Because it is commonly recognized
that Internet content may often be unreliable, unverifiable and biased, early on, we determined that we could not simply use unfiltered
Internet content for delivery to our clients. Our proper licensing of data facilitates the standard of delivery and implementation by
our client/partners. Data Call does the heavy lifting by taking care of not just the licensing, but the proper formatting of that data
for consumption by the industry utilizing our multiple formats offered. Data Call has understood that it s Digital Signage and
Kiosk clients needed a more complete service than to endeavor the sourcing of active content from multiple vendors. As a result, our
flexible content plans permit our clients to do one stop shopping for all dynamic content requirements by licensing subscriptions
through us. 

We
empower our clients to receive customized dynamic content subscriptions to be displayed in a multitude of ways (banners, tickers, scrolls
or visualizations integrated with the overall presentations). We have created Playlist Ready offerings and produced and
distribute multiple sets of common data layouts in the industry-standard formats such as XML (extensible markup language), JSON (JavaScript
Object Notation), JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), RSS (Rich Site Summary, often called Really Simple Syndication), MRSS (Media
RSS) and MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group). With the advent of HTML5 (5th version of Hypertext Markup Language), even more delivery
methods have been made available to our clients, many of whom have found any one or a combination of these formats to be easily integrated
into their products. Nevertheless, we have also produced customized data formats and visualizations to the exact and specific requirements
of our clients/partners, which, we believe ensures a higher level of reliability and ease of implementation. 

Market
demand, opportunity and technology converge at a single point in time, and Data Call continues hold its position. Our integrity persistently
builds our business. Digital signage platforms steadily evolve to meet mass market requirements, costs for hardware and software are
falling to the point of becoming commodities and the markets for digital signage are clarifying through historical trial and error. 

Business
Operations 

In
March of 2017, we released our Direct Lynk Manager (DLManager) customer portal at the Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas. The DLManager
incorporates the Direct Lynk Media platform with major enhancements and options that enable the client to self-serve in a webstore environment.
This is a moderated space that allows proper white glove treatment by our staff that our clients have come to expect and
appreciate. Once the client is comfortable with navigation of the portal, they may then set up multiple groups and displays within their
account for testing results in a demo fashion free of charge. Upon completion of their content selections and distribution points, the
client may purchase the proper number of licenses needed to support their sections through various plans offered within the portal. 

Some

We
continually add different types of content per client requests. We provide our DLM services to our clients and other potential customers
through the Internet. All DLM Services are real-time information services providing a wide range of up-to-date information for display.
These services are designed to work concurrently with customers existing digital signage systems. The Direct Lynk Messenger product
is scheduled to be sunset within the next 12 months, as DLMedia gradually moves into a legacy status with the DLManager portal taking
the forefront. 

Since
our inception in 2002, we have come to deeply understand that this industry provides an exciting platform for advertisers, including
our clients, to promote, inform, educate, and entertain their customers and employees regarding their business products, services, and
corporate communications. Through Digital Signage, and Digital Out of Home (DOOH) businesses can use a single display or a complex, networked
series of displays and video walls to market their products and services directly at their facilities and elsewhere to their customers
and employees in real time. Additionally, because the core of Digital Signage advertising takes place in real time, businesses can change
their marketing and messaging efforts literally from moment to moment and over the course of a day or such other period as they may determine. 

We
believe that the ability of our clients to display in real-time, the information and content we deliver, better allows our clients to
tailor their products, services, advertising and messaging to individual and target-group customers, thereby advertising and offering,
for example, inventory and sales discounts that may be designed to appeal to those individual customers and target customer groups, increasing
sales and revenues. We believe that the benefits of on-site, real-time Digital Signage displays compared to regular print or video advertising
are substantial and include, among other advantages, being able to immediately change digitally-displayed images/advertisements depending
on our client s customers own situation, not simply being restricted by in-store print circulars produced days, weeks or even months
in advance, which may become stale or obsolete prior to or shortly after publication and dissemination. 

We
specialize in enabling our clients to create their own Digital Signage content feeds which are delivered online directly to their chosen,
electronic digital display devices at their various facilities. The only requirements our clients must have are: (i) a supported, third-party
Digital Signage or Kiosk equipment solution - through a CMS or a standalone player, or similar device, which receives the data from our
servers online; and (ii) an Internet connection. Our DLM System is supported by various, readily available third-party systems, varying
in costs from inexpensive monthly cloud-based licenses to much more extensive and expensive content management/playback systems. Our
Systems allow customers to select from their pre-determined data and information subscriptions offered. We enable our clients to also
select location specific content they wish to receive based on how and where their Digital Signage network is configured.

In
December of 2017 the company completed the arduous task of reconstructing our back-end systems architecture. This task was initialized
to exploit the latest technology advances within our space, utilizing our data center efficiencies to further streamline our processes.
One of the greater culminations of this effort yielded the Data Call API (Application Programming Interface) allowing our enterprise
channel partners to embed our products within their offerings to further widen our reach. 

Data
Call continues to grow its client base through relationships that are gained through industry events such as seminars and trade shows.
Our company has become a leader in syndicated content and custom content development for Digital Signage. Our licensed content is utilized
on thousands of screens in hundreds of deployments. We are truly excited of our continued growth through our resellers, CMS manufacturers
and end users. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements. 

During
the last twelve months, the Company has implemented cost management measurements to review monthly expenditures. We will continue these
efforts to streamline operations, as we focus on increasing sales and gross revenues over the next twelve months. We do not currently
have any plans to increase our monthly expenditures or number of employees. We currently offer our Direct Lynk Messenger and DLMedia
services to our clients and other potential customers through the Internet. Both DLM Services are Digital Signage products and real-time
information services which provides a wide range of up-to-date information for display. Both DLM services are able to work concurrently
with customers existing digital signage systems. The Direct Lynk Messenger product is slowly becoming a legacy product with the
DLMedia product in the forefront. 

We
continually add subscribers for our technology throughout and intend to build and increase such subscribers moving forward.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Back to Table of Contents 

A
smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Back to Table of Contents 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). The term disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024, our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at
the reasonable assurance level as described in our Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting filed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K. 

Our
principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although
our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal
executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) or in other factors that occurred during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 that have significantly affected,
or are reasonably likely to significantly affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
