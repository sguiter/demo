million shares of our outstanding common stock until December 31, 2025. We may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices we deem appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares under the authorization, and the repurchase program may be suspended, discontinued, or modified at any time, for any reason and without notice. The parameters of our stock repurchase program are not established solely with reference to the dilutive impact of shares issued under our stock incentive plan. However, we expect that, over time, share repurchases will offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under the stock incentive plan. 
 During the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, we repurchased thousand and thousand outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions at a net cost of million and million. During the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, we repurchased million outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions at a net cost of million.

 Stock Options: Under our stock incentive plan, stock options are granted at exercise prices that equal the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The options have a term and are exercisable upon vesting, which occurs over a period at the anniversary dates of the date of grant. We generally recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis for all awards over the employee s vesting period. We estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and update the estimate throughout the vesting period of the stock options within the amount of compensation costs recognized in each period. 
 We granted non-qualified options to purchase thousand shares and thousand shares for year-to-date 2024 and 2023. 
 Risk-free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
 The expected life of options represents the weighted average period that we expect options granted to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date for the period corresponding to the expected life of the options. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of our common stock, and dividend yields are based on our dividend yield at the date of issuance.

Granted Exercised ) Cancelled ) Outstanding as of September 30, 2024 Exercisable as of September 30, 2024 
 For year-to-date 2024, cash received from the exercise of stock options was approximately million. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options totaled million, which we expect to amortize over the weighted-average period of approximately years. 
 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised 
 Restricted Stock Units: We have granted restricted stock units RSUs to certain key employees. The RSUs are primarily subject to cliff vesting, generally after , provided the employee remains in our service. The fair value of the RSUs is determined based upon the number of shares granted and the quoted market price of our common stock at the grant date. 
 Granted Vested ) Cancelled ) Non-vested as of September 30, 2024 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs was million, which will be amortized on a weighted-average basis over approximately years. 
 Performance Shares: We have a long-term incentive plan for senior management in the form of performance shares. The vesting of the performance shares is generally based on performance metrics. percent of the performance shares awarded vest based on our total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of our peer group, and the remaining percent vest based on the calculation of our average Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC against an established ROIC target.

to percent of the grant depending on our total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of our peer group. The share award vesting will be calculated at the end of the period and is subject to approval by management and the People, Culture, and Compensation Committee Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Compensation expense is based on the fair value of the performance shares at the grant date, established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We amortize the total compensation expense for these awards over a graded vesting schedule. 
 For the 2024 performance shares awarded based on Adjusted ROIC, the number of shares that ultimately vest can range from to percent of the grant depending on our Adjusted ROIC performance against the target. The share award vesting will be calculated at the end of the period and is subject to approval by management and the Compensation Committee. We base compensation expense on the market price of our common stock on the grant date and the final number of shares that ultimately vest. We estimate the potential share vesting at least annually to adjust the compensation expense for these awards over the vesting period to reflect our estimated Adjusted ROIC performance against the target. We amortize the total compensation expense for these awards over a graded vesting schedule. 
 For year-to-date 2024, we awarded thousand performance shares at a weighted average fair value of per share. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards was million, which we will amortize over the remaining service period of years. The 2021 performance share awards that vested in February 2024 achieved a percent payout of the granted performance shares. As of September 30, 2024, we estimated the 2022 performance share awards will pay out at percent. For year-to-date 2024, thousand shares were cancelled.

 Supply Chain Finance Programs 
 Under supply chain finance programs administered by third-party banks, our suppliers have the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financing institutions and receive earlier payment at a discount. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether such supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The payment terms we negotiate with a supplier are independent of whether such supplier participates in a supply chain finance program, and participation in any such program by a supplier has no effect on our income or cash flows.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the terms the Company, Ingredion, we, us, and our and similar terms refer to Ingredion Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this discussion. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading global ingredients solutions provider that transforms grains, fruits, vegetables and other plant-based materials into value-added ingredient solutions for the food, beverage, animal nutrition, brewing and industrial markets. Our innovative ingredient solutions help customers stay on trend with simple ingredients and other in-demand ingredients. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share increased when compared to the same quarter last year while net sales decreased. Net sales decreased primarily due to price mix from lower pass-through of raw material costs to customers as well as volumes associated with the sale of our South Korea business in 2024. Operating income increased during the third quarter primarily due to lower raw material and input costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to lower financing costs and lower raw material and input costs, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discusses our results for our three reportable segments consisting of Texture Healthful Solutions T HS ), Food Industrial Ingredients F II - Latin America LATAM ), and F II - U.S./Canada. In addition, we discuss the results of All Other. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar amounts of our foreign subsidiaries net sales and expenses. For most of our foreign subsidiaries, the local foreign currency is the functional currency. Accordingly, net sales and expenses denominated in the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable average exchange rates for the period. 
 
 Third Quarter of 2024 
 With Comparatives to Third Quarter of 2023 
 Net sales . Net sales decreased 8 percent to 1,870 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,033 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due primarily due to price mix primarily from lower raw material costs and lost sales volume from the sale of our South Korea business, partially offset by volume increases. 
 Cost of sales . Cost of sales decreased 14 percent to 1,391 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to cost of sales of 1,612 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due primarily to lower raw material and input costs which decreased at a faster rate than sales leading to gross profit margin increasing to 26 percent for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 21 percent for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Operating expenses . Operating expenses decreased 3 percent to 198 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 203 million for the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and 10 percent for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Other operating expense (income) . Other operating expense was 1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to other operating (income) of (5) million for the third quarter of 2023. The change was primarily due to insurance recoveries in the third quarter of 2023, whereas there were no such recoveries in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Restructuring and impairment charges . Restructuring and impairment charges were 12 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 10 million for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded an impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment associated with manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom, where 
 24 

we plan to stop production in the first quarter of next year. During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge on an equity method investment. 
 Financing costs . Financing costs decreased 96 percent to 1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 26 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, as well as favorable foreign exchange impacts. 
 Net gain on sale of business . Net gain on sale of business was 8 million for the third quarter of 2024 to reflect the working capital true-up associated with the sale of our South Korea business, which was completed on February 1, 2024. There was no such gain recorded in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Provision for income taxes . Our effective income tax rate was 30.8 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and 13.5 percent for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an adverse ruling that generated a multi-year tax contingency in the third quarter of 2024, as well as lapping a prior year retroactive law change to claim certain foreign tax credits against U.S. taxes, and the change in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. These impacts were partially offset by the tax treatment on the sale of our South Korea business during 2024. 
 Net income attributable to Ingredion . Net income attributable to Ingredion for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 188 million from 158 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower input costs and reduced financing costs, partially offset by a less favorable effective tax rate. 
 Segment Results 
 Texture Healthful Solutions 
 Net sales . T HS net sales remained flat at 600 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 599 million for the third quarter of 2023. An increase in volume of 11 percent were offset by unfavorable price mix of 11 percent. 
 Operating income . T HS operating income increased 12 percent to 96 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 86 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower input costs and recovering volumes, partially offset by unfavorable price mix. 
 Food Industrial Ingredients - LATAM 
 Net sales . F II - LATAM net sales decreased 6 percent to 620 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 658 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price mix of 4 percent and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 3 percent, partially offset by an increase of 1 percent in volume. 
 Operating income . F II - LATAM operating income increased 26 percent to 131 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 104 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower input costs and catch-up pricing on multi-year contracts. 
 Food Industrial Ingredients - U.S./Canada 
 Net sales . F II - U.S./Canada net sales decreased 9 percent to 548 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 599 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to unfavorable price mix of 9 percent. 
 Operating income . F II - U.S./Canada operating income increased 25 percent to 99 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 79 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower raw material and input costs, partially offset by price mix. 
 All Other 
 Net sales . All Other net sales decreased 42 percent to 102 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 177 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease is due to the sale of our South Korea business during 2024. Excluding the sale of our South Korea business, net sales increased 8 percent. 
 25 

Operating (loss) . All Other operating (loss) was (4) million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to (1) million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of our South Korea business. 
 
 Year-to-Date 2024 
 With Comparatives to Year-to-Date 2023 
 Net sales . Net sales decreased 10 percent to 5,630 million for year-to-date 2024 compared to 6,239 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was primarily due to price mix from lower raw material costs and lost sales volume from the sale of our South Korea business, partially offset by increased volumes in the rest of the business. 
 Cost of sales . Cost of sales decreased 12 percent to 4,288 million for year-to-date 2024 compared to 4,890 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower raw material and input costs which decreased at a faster rate than sales leading to an increase in gross profit margin to 24 percent for year-to-date 2024 compared to 22 percent for year-to-date 2023. 
 Operating expenses . Operating expenses were flat at 578 million for year-to-date 2024 compared to 578 million for year-to-date 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10 percent for year-to-date 2024 and 9 percent for year-to-date 2023. 
 Other operating expense . Other operating expense was 5 million for year-to-date 2024 compared to 6 million for year-to-date 2023. 
 Restructuring and impairment charges. Restructuring and impairment charges were 38 million for year-to-date 2024 compared to 10 million for year-to-date 2023. The increase was due primarily to an 18 million impairment charge on an equity method investment, a 8 million impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment associated with manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom and 8 million related to our Cost 2 Compete program that began on January 1, 2024. 
 Financing costs . Financing costs decreased 66 percent to 30 million for year-to-date 2024 compared to 88 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances during the year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023, as well as foreign exchange impacts. 
 Net gain on sale of business. Net gain on sale of business was 90 million for year-to-date 2024 to reflect the sale of our South Korea business, which was completed on February 1, 2024. There was no such gain recorded year-to-date 2023. 
 Provision for income taxes . Our effective income tax rate for year-to-date 2024 increased to 28.5 percent from 21.9 percent for year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to the change in value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and an adverse ruling that generated a multi-year tax contingency in the third quarter of 2024. These impacts were partially offset by the tax treatment on the sale of our South Korea business during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Net income attributable to Ingredion . Net income attributable to Ingredion for year-to-date 2024 increased to 552 million from 512 million for year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale of our South Korea business and reduced financing costs, partially offset by a less favorable effective tax rate. 
 Segment Results 
 T HS 
 Net sales . T HS net sales decreased 5 percent to 1,785 million for year-to-date 2024 from 1,882 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price mix of 11 percent, partially offset by increased volumes of 6 percent. 
 Operating income . T HS operating income decreased 19 percent to 256 million for year-to-date 2024 from 318 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price mix and the carry-forward of higher cost inventory, partially offset by improved volumes. 
 26 

F II - LATAM 
 Net sales . F II - LATAM net sales decreased 6 percent to 1,866 million for year-to-date 2024 from 1,991 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price mix of 7 percent, partially offset by increased volumes of 1 percent. 
 Operating income . F II - LATAM operating income increased 11 percent to 362 million for year-to-date 2024 from 327 million for year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower input costs and catch-up pricing on multi-year contracts.

 Net sales . F II - U.S./Canada net sales decreased 9 percent to 1,644 million for year-to-date 2024 from 1,811 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price mix of 8 percent and unfavorable volume of 1 percent. 
 Operating income . F II - U.S./Canada operating income increased 16 percent to 291 million for year-to-date 2024 from 251 million for year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower raw material and input costs, partially offset by price mix. 
 All Other 
 Net sales . All Other net sales decreased 40 percent to 335 million for year-to-date 2024 from 555 million for year-to-date 2023. Excluding the sale of our South Korea business, net sales were up 1 percent. 
 Operating (loss) . All Other operating (loss) increased 200 percent to (18) million for year-to-date 2024 compared to (6) million for year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to the sale of our South Korea business in 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total available liquidity of 2.5 billion. Domestic liquidity of 1.3 billion consisted of 289 million in cash and cash equivalents and 1.0 billion available through our commercial paper program. The commercial paper program is backed by 1.0 billion of borrowing availability under a five-year revolving credit agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had international liquidity of 1.2 billion, consisting of 588 million of cash and cash equivalents and 7 million of short-term investments held by our operations outside the U.S., as well as 642 million of unused operating lines of credit in foreign countries where we operate. As the parent company, we guarantee certain obligations of our consolidated subsidiaries. These guarantees totaled 40 million as of September 30, 2024. We believe that those consolidated subsidiaries will be able to meet their financial obligations as they become due. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total debt outstanding of 1.8 billion, or 1.7 billion excluding other short-term borrowings. Of our outstanding debt, 1.7 billion consists of senior notes that do not require principal repayment until 2026 through 2050. The weighted average interest rate on our total indebtedness was approximately 4.0 percent for year-to-date 2024 and approximately 4.4 percent for year-to-date 2023. 
 The principal source of our liquidity is our internally generated cash flow, which we supplement as necessary with our ability to borrow under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and to raise funds in the capital markets. We currently expect that our available cash balances, future cash flow from operations, access to debt markets and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated capital expenditures, dividends and other operating, investing and financing activities for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our future cash flow needs will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, cost of raw materials, changing working capital requirements, the timing and extent of our expansion into new markets, the timing of introductions of new products, potential acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, continuing market acceptance of our new products and general economic and market conditions. We may need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our needs for less predictable strategic initiatives, such as acquisitions. 
 27 

Net Cash Flows 
 Our cash provided by operating activities was 1.0 billion for year-to-date 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 647 million for year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 371 million change in working capital due to decreases in inventory and trade accounts receivable, and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 We used 170 million of cash for capital expenditures and mechanical stores purchases to update, expand and improve our facilities during year-to-date 2024 compared to 233 million that we paid during year-to-date 2023 for the same purposes. Capital investment commitments for the remainder of 2024 are anticipated to be between 310 million and 330 million. 
 We used 601 million of cash for financing activities during year-to-date 2024 compared to cash used for financing activities of 301 million for year-to-date 2023. The difference was primarily due to a net 327 million reduction of our commercial paper borrowings during year-to-date 2024 from 57 million net borrowings of commercial paper during year-to-date 2023. 
 We declare and pay cash dividends to our common stockholders of record on a quarterly basis. Dividends paid, including those to non-controlling interests, was 156 million during year-to-date 2024 compared to 143 million during year-to-date 2023. The increase in dividend payments was due to an increase in our quarterly dividend to 0.78 per share during year-to-date 2024 from 0.71 per share during year-to-date 2023. 
 During the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, we repurchased 185 thousand and 762 thousand outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions at a net cost of 21 million and 87 million. During the third quarter and year-to-date 2023, we repurchased 1.0 million outstanding shares of common stock at a net cost of 101 million. During year-to-date 2024, we purchased shares in our subsidiary PureCircle from minority shareholders for 40 million, which increased our ownership to 98 percent as of September 30, 2024. 
 We have not provided foreign withholding taxes, state income taxes and federal and state taxes on foreign currency gains/losses on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings. We do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
