 billion, were comprised of million for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs. 
 During the first half of 2023, in connection with the integration of Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, we performed a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. Additionally, we commenced a review of our international content portfolio in connection with initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and close or globalize certain of our international channels. As a result, we changed the strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements. Accordingly, we recorded programming charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to these actions in the first half of 2023. These charges, which totaled billion, were comprised of billion for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value and, million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs. 
 For content that was removed from our platforms or abandoned in each period, the estimated fair value was determined using assumptions for secondary market licensing revenues, if any.

 reporting units. 
 
 The impairment test for our Cable Networks reporting unit indicated that a goodwill impairment charge of billion was required, which represented the goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to the impairment test. The impairment charge, which was recorded within the TV Media segment during the second quarter of 2024, resulted from a downward adjustment to the reporting unit s expected cash flows, primarily because of the linear affiliate market indicators noted above, and the estimated total company market value indicated by the Transactions and the NAI Transaction. The estimated fair value of our Cable Networks reporting unit was based on the discounted cash

 and a terminal value that was based on a long-term growth rate of ) . 
 
 The fair values of the remaining reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required. reporting units had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by less than and the remaining reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. 
 
 FCC Licenses 
 FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. 
 
 Our FCC licenses impairment tests are performed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which estimates the fair values of FCC licenses by valuing a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. 
 
 For the second quarter of 2024, we assessed the relevant factors that could impact the fair value of our FCC licenses, including projections by geographic market, and determined that interim impairment tests were necessary for markets in which we hold FCC licenses. These tests, for which we used a discount rate of and a long-term growth rate of , indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in of the markets tested were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value. The impairment charge, which was recorded within the TV Media segment, was primarily the result of recent declines in industry projections. 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, as a result of a further decline in industry-projected long-term growth rates, we determined that an interim impairment test was necessary for each of our markets with FCC license book values, which totaled billion prior to the impairment tests. The tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in of the markets were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in these markets to their aggregate estimated fair value of billion. The impairment charge, which was recorded within the TV Media segment, was primarily the result of a reduction in

 We recorded severance charges of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which million was recorded during the third quarter. These charges were associated with strategic changes in our global workforce in order to streamline our organization and the exit of our former CEO. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, we recorded charges of million for the impairment of lease assets that we ceased use of in connection with initiatives to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. The impairments were primarily the result of a decline in market conditions since the inception of these leases and reflect the difference between the estimated fair values, which were determined based on the expected future cash flows of the lease assets, and the carrying values.

 Included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent receivables of billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Noncurrent receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term content licensing arrangements.

These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts, primarily consisting of television and film licensing contracts and affiliate agreements that are subject to a fixed or guaranteed minimum fee. Such amounts change on a regular basis as we renew existing agreements or enter into new agreements. In addition, the timing of satisfying certain of the performance obligations under these long-term contracts is uncertain and, therefore, is also subject to change. Unrecognized revenues under contracts disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of advertising contracts, (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for

 Commercial Paper 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a billion revolving credit facility that matures in January 2027 (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars is Term SOFR, and for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the availability under the Credit Facility was billion. 
 
 The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Leverage Ratio at the end of each quarter. The maximum Leverage Ratio was x for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and will decrease to x for the quarters ending December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, with further decreases of x for each subsequent quarter until the quarter ending March 31, 2026 when it will be x, and will remain at this level until maturity. The Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. For quarters ending on or after September 30, 2024, the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio is billion. We met the covenant as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Credit Facility also includes a provision that the occurrence of a change of control of Paramount will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. On August 1, 2024, we entered into amendments to the Credit Facility and our billion standby letter of credit facility (see Note 14), which, among other things, revise the change of control provision and related definitions to reflect the ownership structure of Paramount after giving effect to the Transactions and the NAI Transaction. In addition, the amendments increase the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio to billion. These amendments will only become operative upon closing of the Transactions (see Note 1).

In April 2023, our ownership of Viacom18 was diluted from to following investment by other parties. The difference between the carrying value of our interest and the fair value of our interest, as indicated by the additional investments, resulted in a noncash gain of million during the second quarter of 2023. 
 In March 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Viacom18 to Reliance Industries Limited Reliance ), the majority interest holder, for an aggregate purchase price of billion Indian rupees. The closing of this transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the completion of a separate transaction between Viacom 18, Reliance and a third party. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Contracts 
 We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
 
 Foreign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows in currencies such as the British pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar, generally for periods up to months. We designate foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. 
 In August 2024, in connection with the proposed sale of our interest in Viacom18, we entered into a foreign currency option contract to mitigate the exchange rate risk of the Indian rupee-denominated purchase price. The option contract has a notional amount of billion Indian rupees and settlement is contingent upon closing of the transaction. This option is a non-designated hedge, and therefore, changes in the fair value of the hedge are recognized in Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional amount of all foreign exchange contracts was billion and billion, respectively.

 Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in January 2023. In February 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed. The plaintiffs and underwriter defendants appealed the ruling , and in April 2024, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, ruled in our favor and upheld the decision of the trial court dismissing the case against the Company and its officers. The plaintiffs sought leave to reargue, or alternatively, appeal the ruling to the New York Court of Appeals, and in July 2024, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, denied the plaintiffs request. 
 
 Claims Related to Former Businesses 
 Asbestos 
 We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment. 
 
 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of September 30, 2024, we had pending approximately asbestos claims, as compared with approximately as of December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we received approximately new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2023 and 2022 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately million and million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses. 
 
 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is

 years, which we determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and is due to the inherent uncertainties in the tort litigation system. Our estimated asbestos liability is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, and is assessed in consultation with the third-party firm. Changes in circumstances in future periods could cause our actual liabilities to be higher or lower than our current accrual.

Up to 4.5 billion of the proceeds will be used to fund the cash-stock election discussed below and a minimum of 1.5 billion of cash (less a subscription discount of 1.875 will remain at New Paramount. If the cash-stock elections are undersubscribed, up to an additional 1.5 billion (less a subscription discount of 1.875 of the unused portion of the 4.5 billion will also remain at New Paramount.

The shares that are settled in cash will cease to exist after the completion of the Transactions. 
 
 The Transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and are expected to close in the first half of 2025. Consummation of the foregoing transactions is also subject to the contemporaneous consummation of each other transaction described above. In the event of a termination of the Transaction Agreement under certain specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Skydance a termination fee in the amount of 400 million.

 (a) Certain items identified as affecting comparability are excluded in non-GAAP results. See Reconciliation of Non- G AAP Measures for details of these items and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues decreased 4 to 21.23 billion, driven by lower revenue from licensing, theatrical releases and our linear networks. These decreases were partially offset by growth in revenues from our streaming services, led by Paramount+, and a 2-percentage point benefit to total revenue from CBS broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII . We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl on a rotational basis with other networks and therefore did not have a comparable broadcast in 2023. 
 
 We reported an operating loss of 5.40 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with an operating loss of 855 million for the comparable prior-year period. The operating loss in 2024 includes programming charges of 1.12 billion, impairment charges totaling 6.10 billion, and restructuring charges and transaction-related costs totaling 595 million, while 2023 includes programming charges of 2.37 billion and restructuring charges and transaction-related costs of 44 million. Adjusted OIBDA, which excludes these items, increased 45 , driven by improved results for our streaming services, partially offset by declines for our linear networks. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures . 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of 5.98 billion, or 9.04 per diluted share, compared with a net loss from continuing operations

 attributable to Paramount of 1.29 billion, or 2.04 per diluted share, for the same prior-year period. The comparison was impacted by the charges noted above and the other items described under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures . These items have been excluded in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and adjusted diluted EPS, which improved by 753 million, or 1.17 per diluted share, primarily reflecting the higher tax-effected Adjusted OIBDA and lower interest expense in 2024. 
 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
 Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, and adjusted effective income tax rate (together, the adjusted measures exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results. 
 
 Because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, (provision for) benefit from income taxes, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Paramount, diluted EPS from continuing operations, and effective income tax rate, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 
 
 The following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The tax impacts on the items identified as affecting comparability in the tables below have been calculated using the tax rate applicable to each item.

This impact was partially offset by amounts realized in connection with the filing of our tax returns in certain international jurisdictions. 
 (e) The reported effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.6 and the adjusted effective income tax rate, which is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes of 383 million divided by adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of 1.76 billion, was 21.8 .

 Advertising 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, advertising revenues increased 2 and 5 , respectively, reflecting growth from Paramount+ and Pluto TV, higher political advertising revenue, and amounts recognized in each period relating to the underreporting of revenue by an international sales partner in prior periods, offset by declines in the linear advertising market. The nine-month period also included an 8-percentage point benefit from the broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII on CBS. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl on a rotational basis with other networks, and therefore did not have a comparable broadcast in 2023. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, our contract with Nielsen for audience measurement services expired. As a result, we are measuring content viewership and advertising delivery using data from alternate providers. While the impact on our advertising cannot be determined at this time, we have not seen a material impact to date. 
 
 Affiliate and Subscription 
 Affiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of affiliate fees we receive from distributors for their carriage of both our cable networks (cable affiliate fees) and television stations (retransmission fees), as well as fees received from third-party television stations for their affiliation with the CBS Television Network (reverse compensation), and subscription fees for our streaming services. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 1 , reflecting decreases of 3 from declines in linear affiliate fees and 2 from the absence of pay-per-view boxing events, which we no longer broadcast beginning in 2024, partially offset by a 4 increase from our streaming services, driven by subscriber growth and domestic pricing increases for Paramount+. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, affiliate and subscription fees increased 2 , reflecting 6 growth from our streaming services, driven by subscriber growth and domestic pricing increases for Paramount+, partially offset by decreases

 of 2 from declines in linear affiliate fees and 2 from the absence of pay-per-view boxing events. Paramount+ subscribers grew to 71.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 63.4 million at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Theatrical 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, theatrical revenues decreased 269 million and 336 million, respectively, reflecting the number, mix and timing of releases in each year, including the comparison against the releases of Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem in the third quarter of 2023, while the 2024 periods benefited from the release of A Quiet Place: Day One . The nine-month comparison also reflects the success of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts in the prior year. 
 
 Licensing and Other 
 Licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from the rental of production facilities. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, licensing and other revenues decreased 9 and 22 , respectively. The decrease in each period reflects lower licensing in the secondary market and the nine-month comparison also reflects a lower volume of content produced for third parties. Content available for licensing in 2024 was impacted by temporary production shutdowns due to labor strikes in 2023.

 Content Costs 
 Content costs include the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content; amortization of acquired program rights; other television production costs, including on-air talent; and participation and residuals expenses, which reflect amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, content costs decreased 8 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with theatrical releases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, content costs decreased 9 driven by lower costs associated with the decrease in licensing and theatrical revenues, partially offset by costs associated with CBS broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII . The decrease in each period also reflects the impact from changes in our content strategy further described under Programming Charges . In addition, content costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, included 57 million of incremental costs incurred to retain our production capabilities for certain of the television and film productions that were delayed as a result of the labor strikes. 
 
 Distribution and Other 
 Distribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including marketing for theatrical releases; revenue-sharing costs, including for third-party distribution and to television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; compensation and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, distribution and other operating expenses decreased 6 and 2 , respectively, driven by lower theatrical distribution costs, reflecting the number and mix of theatrical releases during the 2024 periods compared with the same periods in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue sharing costs for our streaming services, mainly costs for third-party distribution. 
 
 Programming Charges 
 During the first quarter of 2024, in connection with our continued review of our content strategy, we made a strategic decision to focus on content with mass global appeal. As part of this, we decided to rationalize original content on our streaming services, especially internationally, and improve the efficiency of our linear network programming. As a result, we reviewed our expansive global content portfolio and removed select content from our platforms. In addition, we decided not to move forward with certain titles and therefore have abandoned some development projects and terminated certain programming agreements. Accordingly, we recorded programming charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the first quarter of 2024 relating to these actions. These charges, which totaled 1.12 billion, were comprised of 909 million for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as 209 million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs. 
 
 During the first half of 2023, in connection with the integration of Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, we performed a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. Additionally, we commenced a review of our international content portfolio in connection with initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and close or globalize certain of our international channels. As a result, we changed the strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements. Accordingly, we recorded programming charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to these actions in the first half of 2023. These charges, which totaled 2.37 billion, were comprised of 1.97 billion for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as 402 million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs.

These charges were associated with strategic changes in our global workforce in order to streamline our organization and the exit of our former CEO. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, we recorded charges of 31 million for the impairment of lease assets that we ceased use of in connection with initiatives to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. In addition, during the three

 Provision for/Benefit from Income Taxes 
 The provision for/benefit from income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 45 million and for nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 342 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 37.5 and 5.6 , respectively. For the three-month period, the tax provision includes a tax benefit of 66 million on pretax restructuring charges and transaction-related costs of 321 million and a tax benefit of 26 million on a pretax impairment charge of 104 million. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the three-month period was 25.5 . See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures . For the nine-month period the income tax benefit is primarily the result of a tax benefit of 375 million on pretax impairment charges for goodwill and FCC licenses totaling 6.10 billion and a tax benefit of 275 million on pretax programming charges of 1.12 billion. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the nine-month period, which excludes the impact from impairment and programming charges, as well as the other items impacting comparability described under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures , was 21.8 . 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 40 million, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 436 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 10.6 and 30.4 , respectively. Included in the third quarter of 2023 is a net discrete tax benefit of 33 million, primarily reflecting the benefit from guidance issued during the quarter by the IRS that resulted in additional foreign taxes from 2022 being eligible for a foreign tax credit, and amounts realized in connection with the filing of our tax returns in certain international jurisdictions. The tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of tax benefits of 582 million on pretax programming charges of 2.37 billion. Our adjusted effective income tax rates, which exclude the impacts from programming charges, discrete tax benefits, as well as the other items impacting comparability described under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures , were 19.1 and 20.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues decreased 6 . 
 
 Advertising 
 The 2 decrease in advertising revenues reflects declines in the linear advertising market, partially offset by amounts recognized during the period relating to the underreporting of revenue by an international sales partner in prior periods and a 4-percentage point benefit from higher political advertising as a result of the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. Domestic advertising revenues decreased 7 to 1.33 billion, reflecting the market decline, partially offset by higher political advertising. International advertising revenues increased 24 to 339 million. 
 
 Affiliate and Subscription 
 Affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, principally reflecting decreases of 6 from linear subscriber declines and 2 from the absence of pay-per-view boxing events, which we no longer broadcast beginning in 2024, partially offset by an increase of 2 from contractual pricing. 
 
 Licensing and Other 
 Licensing and other revenues decreased 12 , primarily reflecting a lower volume of licensing in the secondary market. 
 
 Adjusted OIBDA 
 Adjusted OIBDA decreased 19 , mainly as a result of the decline in affiliate revenue and lower profits from licensing.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues decreased 7 . 
 
 Advertising 
 The 1 increase in advertising revenues includes a 9-percentage point benefit from CBS broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII in the first quarter of 2024 and a 2-percentage point benefit from higher political advertising. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl on a rotational basis with other networks, and therefore did not have a comparable broadcast in 2023. These increases were substantially offset by declines in the linear advertising market. Domestic advertising revenues decreased 10 million to 5.07 billion. International advertising revenues increased 10 to 912 million, driven by amounts recognized during 2024 relating to the underreporting of revenue by an international sales partner in prior periods, partially offset by market declines. 
 
 Affiliate and Subscription 
 Affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting decreases of 6 from linear subscriber declines and 1 from the absence of pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by an increase of 2 from contractual pricing. 
 
 Licensing and Other 
 Licensing and other revenues decreased 30 , reflecting a lower volume of licensing in the secondary market and lower revenues from content produced for third parties. Content available for licensing was impacted by temporary production shutdowns due to labor strikes in 2023. 
 
 Adjusted OIBDA 
 Adjusted OIBDA decreased 7 , primarily reflecting the decline in revenues, which was largely offset by lower costs for content, marketing and compensation. The lower content costs were mainly driven by the decline in licensing revenues.

 Revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 10 increase in revenues was primarily driven by growth from Paramount+. 
 
 Advertising 
 The 18 increase in advertising revenues reflects growth in impressions for Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Higher political advertising sales also benefited the comparison. 
 
 Subscription 
 The 7 increase in subscription revenues was driven by growth in Paramount+ subscribers and domestic pricing increases that we began to benefit from during the third quarter of 2023. Paramount+ subscribers increased 8.5 million, or 13 , compared with September 30, 2023, reflecting growth in both domestic and international subscribers. Growth in Paramount+ subscribers includes the migration of certain subscribers from Showtime s premium subscription streaming service, which was no longer offered as a standalone service to new subscribers effective July 6, 2023 and was no longer available as of April 30, 2024. The growth was partially offset by a negative impact of 4-percentage points from the absence of pay-per-view boxing events in 2024. 
 
 During the quarter, global Paramount+ subscribers increased 3.5 million, or 5 , to 71.9 million, compared with 68.4 million at June 30, 2024, principally reflecting international expansion.

 Fluctuations in results for the Filmed Entertainment segment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including marketing costs, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film s theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 We project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes; and pension funding obligations. 
 
 Our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures; acquisitions; funding of investments, including our streaming joint venture, SkyShowtime, under which we and our joint venture partner have committed to

 support initial operations over a multiyear period; discretionary share repurchases; dividends; and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. Our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years were 2.64 billion as of September 30, 2024. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to manage our outstanding debt maturities, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt. 
 
 Funding for both our short-term and long-term operating, investing and financing needs will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, which were 2.44 billion as of September 30, 2024, and our ability to refinance our debt. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the borrowing capacity under our 3.50 billion Credit Facility described below is sufficient to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. In addition, if necessary, we can increase our liquidity position by reducing non-committed spending. 
 
 Pursuant to the Transactions, the NAI Equity Investors and certain other affiliates of investors of Skydance will make an investment of up to 6.0 billion into New Paramount in exchange for up to 400 million newly issued shares of New Paramount Class B Common Stock. Up to 4.5 billion of these proceeds will be used to fund a cash-stock election for Paramount stockholders (other than NAI, the NAI Equity Investors and certain other affiliates of investors of Skydance) and a minimum of 1.5 billion of cash (less a subscription discount of 1.875 will remain at New Paramount. If the cash-stock elections are undersubscribed, up to an additional 1.5 billion (less a subscription discount of 1.875 of the unused portion of the 4.5 billion will also remain at New Paramount. 
 
 Our access to capital markets and the cost of any new borrowings are impacted by factors outside our control, including economic and market conditions, as well as by ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.

 measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50 equity credit by Standard Poor s Rating Services, Fitch Ratings Inc., and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. 
 
 Commercial Paper 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a 3.50 billion revolving credit facility that matures in January 2027 (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars is Term SOFR, and for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the availability under the Credit Facility was 3.50 billion. 
 
 The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Leverage Ratio at the end of each quarter. The maximum Leverage Ratio was 5.75x for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and will decrease to 5.5x for the quarters ending December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, with further decreases of 0.25x for each subsequent quarter until the quarter ending March 31, 2026 when it will be 4.5x, and will remain at this level until maturity. The Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. For quarters ending on or after September 30, 2024, the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio is 1.50 billion. We met the covenant as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Credit Facility also includes a provision that the occurrence of a change of control of Paramount will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. On August 1, 2024, we entered into amendments to the Credit Facility and our 1.9 billion standby letter of credit facility (see Guarantees Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds ), which, among other things, revise the change of control provision and related definitions to reflect the ownership structure of Paramount after giving effect to the Transactions and the NAI Transaction. In addition, the amendments increase the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio to 3.0 billion. These amendments will only become operative upon closing of the Transactions. 
 
 Other Bank Borrowings 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding bank borrowings under Miramax s 50 million credit facility that matures in November 2025.

 Guarantees 
 Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of 675 million that were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including 464 million that was issued under a 1.9 billion standby letter of credit facility in accordance with the contractual requirements of one of our commitments. The amount outstanding under the letter of credit facility decreases throughout 2024 as we make payments under the related contractual commitment. Letters of credit and surety bonds are primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business under contractual requirements of certain of our commitments. The standby letter of credit facility, which matures in May 2026, is subject to provisions similar to the Credit Facility, including the same principal financial covenant (see Capital Structure Credit Facility ). 
 
 Lease Guarantees 
 We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. Our guarantee liability relating to these lease commitments totaled 8 million at September 30, 2024, and is presented within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of these lease commitments varies over time depending on the expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees business models. 
 
 Other 
 In the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of our other critical accounting estimates. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Tests 
 We perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.

 Goodwill 
 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. 
 
 For the second quarter of 2024, we assessed the relevant factors that could impact the fair value of our reporting units, including indicators in the linear affiliate marketplace and the estimated total company market value indicated by the Transactions and the NAI Transaction announced on July 7, 2024. Based on this assessment, we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary for each of our five reporting units. 
 
 In order to test goodwill for impairment, we calculated an estimated fair value for each reporting unit to determine whether it exceeded the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. Approaches used to estimate the fair values were the discounted cash flow method, the traded values of comparable businesses, and the transaction values of comparable businesses. The discounted cash flow method, which estimates fair value based on the present value of future cash flows, requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of these cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. The assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the applicable reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. The terminal value is estimated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on expected trends and projections for the relevant industry. A discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. Traded and transaction values were determined using comparable company trading multiples as well as multiples from recent transactions of comparable companies. The selected multiples consider each reporting unit s relative growth, profitability, size, and risk relative to the selected publicly traded companies. We also considered the reasonableness of the market capitalization of our Company in relation to the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units. 
 
 The impairment test for our Cable Networks reporting unit indicated that a goodwill impairment charge of 5.98 billion was required, which represented the goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to the impairment test. The impairment charge, which was recorded within the TV Media segment during the second quarter of 2024, resulted from a downward adjustment to the reporting unit s expected cash flows, primarily because of the linear affiliate market indicators noted above, and the estimated total company market value indicated by the Transactions and the NAI Transaction. The estimated fair value of our Cable Networks reporting unit was based on the discounted cash flow method, utilizing a discount rate of 11 and a terminal value that was based on a long-term growth rate of (3) . 
 
 The fair values of our remaining reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required. Our Filmed Entertainment reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount, and the remaining three reporting units had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by less than 10 . 
 
 The estimated fair value of our CBS Entertainment reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by 4 and had a goodwill balance of 5.16 billion at June 30, 2024, was based on both the discounted cash flow method and the traded values of comparable businesses utilizing an OIBDA multiple. An increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points, or a decrease to the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause a decrease to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit of 200 million and 100 million, respectively, and the fair value would exceed the carrying value by 3 and 4 , respectively. 
 
 The estimated fair value of our Paramount+ reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by 5 and had a goodwill balance of 1.47 billion at June 30, 2024, was based on the traded and transaction values of comparable 
 -60- 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 businesses utilizing revenue multiples. A decrease of 0.1x to the multiple would cause the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its carrying value by 299 million. 
 
 The estimated fair value of our Pluto TV reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by 4 and had a goodwill balance of 1.26 billion at June 30, 2024, was based on the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses utilizing revenue multiples. A decrease of 0.1x to the multiple would cause the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its carrying value by 41 million. 
 
 Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, increases in interest rates, and unfavorable impacts to the projections used in the impairment tests for the reporting units discussed above, including from further declines in the linear advertising and affiliate markets, an increased shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior, a decrease in audience acceptance of our content and platforms, and delays or difficulties in achieving our profitability goals for our streaming services, could cause the fair values of these reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 FCC Licenses 
 FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. 
 Our FCC licenses impairment tests are performed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which estimates the fair values of FCC licenses by valuing a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. 
 
 For the second quarter of 2024, we assessed the relevant factors that could impact the fair value of our FCC licenses, including projections by geographic market, and determined that interim impairment tests were necessary for eight markets in which we hold FCC licenses. These tests, for which we used a discount rate of 8 and a long-term growth rate of 0 , indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in two of the eight markets tested were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of 15 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value. The impairment charge, which was recorded within the TV Media segment, was primarily the result of recent declines in industry projections. 
 -61- 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 For the third quarter of 2024, as a result of a further decline in industry-projected long-term growth rates, we determined that an interim impairment test was necessary for each of our 14 markets with FCC license book values, which totaled 2.29 billion prior to the impairment tests. The tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in five of the 14 markets were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of 104 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in these five markets to their aggregate estimated fair value of 1.03 billion. The impairment charge, which was recorded within the TV Media segment, was primarily the result of a reduction in the long-term growth rate utilized in the impairment tests to (2) . The estimated fair values of FCC licenses in the remaining nine markets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 . 
 
 A further decrease to the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points, or an increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the aggregate fair value of FCC licenses to fall below the aggregate carrying value by an additional 67 million and 86 million, respectively. 
 
 The estimated fair values of FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations and long-term projections for advertising revenues. Certain future events and circumstances, including market volatility and increases in interest rates, or a further decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A further downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in an additional impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 General 
 On an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, Litigation ). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Litigation Related to the Transactions 
 On July 24, 2024, Scott Baker (the Plaintiff ), a purported holder of Paramount Class B Common Stock, filed a putative class action lawsuit (the Baker Action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against NAI, Shari E. Redstone, Barbara M. Byrne, Linda M. Griego, Judith A. McHale, Charles E. Phillips, Jr., Susan Schuman, Skydance and David Ellison (the Complaint ). The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Paramount s Class B stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Transaction Agreement, among other claims. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On November 4, 2024, the Court granted a stipulation filed by the parties in the Baker Action agreeing to (i) postpone briefing on motions to dismiss until the filing or designation of an operative complaint following the resolution of Plaintiff s motion to appoint him and the Baerlocher Family Trust, a purported holder of Paramount Class B Common Stock, as co-lead plaintiffs and Berger Montague PC as interim class counsel (the Leadership Motion

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 and (ii) stay discovery until the resolution of any motions to dismiss any operative complaint following resolution of the Leadership Motion. 
 
 Further, on April 30, 2024, a purported holder of Paramount Class B Common Stock filed a verified complaint for the inspection of books and records under Section 220 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Paramount, seeking the inspection of books and records of Paramount in order to investigate whether our Board of Directors, NAI, Shari E. Redstone and/or Paramount s executive officers may have breached their fiduciary duties to Paramount s stockholders for alleged diversion of corporate opportunities (the 220 Action ). The Court held a trial on July 24, 2024 relating to the 220 Action and denied the request for the inspection of books and records. The plaintiff in the 220 Action has since noticed an exception to the Court, and the matter is on appeal. Certain other purported holders of Paramount Class B Common Stock and Paramount Class A Common Stock have delivered demand letters to investigate similar alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the Transactions and are requesting the inspection of books and records. 
 
 Litigation Related to Stock Offerings 
 In August 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and in November 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the Complaint ). The Complaint is on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company s Class B Common Stock and 5.75 Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in January 2023. In February 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed. The plaintiffs and underwriter defendants appealed the ruling, and in April 2024, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, ruled in our favor and upheld the decision of the trial court dismissing the case against the Company and its officers. The plaintiffs sought leave to reargue, or alternatively, appeal the ruling to the New York Court of Appeals, and in July 2024, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, denied the plaintiffs request. 
 
 Claims Related to Former Businesses 
 Asbestos 
 We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment. 
 
 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending 
 -63- 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of September 30, 2024, we had pending approximately 19,360 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 19,970 as of December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we received approximately 750 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 490 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2023 and 2022 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately 54 million and 57 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses. 
 
 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. A significant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict long-term future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The reasonably estimable period for our long-term asbestos liability is 10 years, which we determined in consultation with a third-party firm with expertise in estimating asbestos liability and is due to the inherent uncertainties in the tort litigation system. Our estimated asbestos liability is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, and is assessed in consultation with the third-party firm. Changes in circumstances in future periods could cause our actual liabilities to be higher or lower than our current accrual. We will continue to evaluate our estimates and update our accrual as needed. 
 
 Other 
 From time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods and, as a result, our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.
