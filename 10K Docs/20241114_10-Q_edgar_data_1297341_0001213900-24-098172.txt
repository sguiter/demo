At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 the Company s
debt securities consisted of mortgage-backed securities, which do not have a single maturity date. Actual maturities may differ from
contractual maturities, because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

Our pledged securities totaled at both September
30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. In addition, at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, pledged overnight deposits totaled . 

We evaluated securities in unrealized loss positions
for evidence of credit loss, considering duration, severity, financial condition of the issuer, our intention to sell or requirement
to sell. Those securities were agency mortgage-backed securities, which carry a very limited amount of risk. Also, we have no intention
to sell nor feel that we will be compelled to sell such securities before maturity. Based on our evaluation, no reserve for credit loss
was considered necessary. Debt securities in an unrealized loss position as a percent of total debt securities were and at
September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The following table provides the amortized cost, gross unrealized losses, fair value,
and length of time the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024.

or less. Management, at its discretion, may determine that additional adjustments
to the appraisal or valuation are required. Valuation adjustments will be made as necessary based on factors, including, but not limited
to: the economy, deferred maintenance, industry, type of collateral, age of the appraisal, etc., and the knowledge Management has about
a particular situation. In addition, the cost to sell or liquidate the collateral is also estimated and deducted from the valuation in
order to determine the net realizable value to the Banks. When determining the ACL, certain factors involved in the evaluation are inherently
subjective and require material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change, including the amounts and timing of future cash
flows. Management monitors the adequacy of the ACL on an ongoing basis and reports its adequacy quarterly to the Board of Directors.
Management believes the ACL at September 30, 2024 is adequate.

of the value with private mortgage insurance. Alternatively, the borrower may be able to borrow up to of the value through other
programs offered by the bank. 

We offer loans on one- to four-family rental
properties at a maximum of loan-to-value LTV ratio and we generally charge a slightly higher interest rate on such
loans. 

We also originate loans to individuals to finance
the construction of residential dwellings for personal use or for use as rental property. We occasionally lend to builders for construction
of speculative or custom residential properties for resale, but on a limited basis. Construction loans are generally less than one year
in length, do not exceed of the appraised value, and provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase. Funds
are disbursed as progress is made toward completion of the construction. 

Multi-family Loans 

We offer mortgage loans secured by residential
multi-family (five or more units). Generally, these loans are originated for 25 years or less and do not exceed of the appraised
value. Loans secured by multi-family generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential
mortgage loans. These loans depend on the borrower s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project.
Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment
on such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economy than owner-occupied residential
loans.

years or less and do not exceed of the appraised value. As with multi-family loans, commercial real estate
loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and these
loans depend on the borrower s creditworthiness, as well as the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on
loans secured by nonresidential properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment
on such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economy than owner-occupied residential
loans. 

Consumer lending 

Our consumer loans include home equity lines
of credit, loans secured by savings deposits, automobile loans, and unsecured loans. Home equity loans are generally second mortgage
loans subordinate only to first mortgages also held by the bank and do not exceed of the estimated value of the property. We do offer
home equity loans up to of the estimated value to qualified borrowers and these loans carry a premium interest rate. Loans secured
by savings are originated up to of the depositor s savings account balance and bear interest at a rate higher than the rate
paid on the deposit account. Because the deposit account must be pledged as collateral to secure the loan, the inherent risk of this
type of loan is minimal. Loans secured by automobiles are made directly to consumers (there are no relationships with dealers) and are
based on the value of the vehicle and the borrower s creditworthiness. Vehicle loans present a higher level of risk because of
the natural decline in the value of the property as well as its mobility. Unsecured loans are based entirely on the borrower s
creditworthiness and present the highest level of risk to the bank. 

Impaired loans 

The Banks choose the most appropriate method
for accounting for impaired loans. For secured loans, which make up the vast majority of the loans in the Banks portfolio, this
method involves determining the fair value of the collateral, reduced by estimated selling costs. Where appropriate, the Banks would
account for impaired loans by determining the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest
rate. 

A loan is considered impaired when, based on
current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual
terms of the loan agreement. Although most of our loans are secured by collateral, we rely heavily on the capacity of our borrowers to
generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt. As a result, our loans do not become collateral-dependent until there is deterioration
in the borrower s cash flow and financial condition, which makes it necessary for us to look to the collateral for our sole source
of repayment. Collateral-dependent loans which are more than ninety days delinquent are considered to constitute more than a minimum
delay in repayment and are evaluated for impairment under the policy at that time. 

We utilize updated independent appraisals to
determine fair value for collateral-dependent loans, adjusted for estimated selling costs, in determining our specific reserve. In some
situations, management does not secure an updated independent appraisal. These situations may involve small loan amounts or loans that,
in management s opinion, have an abnormally low loan-to-value ratio. 

With respect to the Banks investment in
troubled debt restructurings, multi-family and nonresidential loans, and the evaluation of impairment thereof, such loans are nonhomogenous
and, as such, may be deemed to be collateral-dependent when they become more than 90 days delinquent. We obtain updated independent appraisals
in these situations or when we suspect that the previous appraisal may no longer be reflective of the property s current fair value.
This process varies from loan to loan, borrower to borrower, and also varies based on the nature of the collateral.

Credit Quality Indicators: 

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories
based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical
payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans
individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on an annual basis. The Company uses the following
definitions for risk ratings: 

Special Mention. Loans classified
as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses
may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard. Loans classified
as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if
any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized
by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful. Loans classified as
doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Agency mortgage-backed: residential 

There were no assets or liabilities which were
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024. 

The following is a disclosure of the fair value
of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, for which it is practicable
to estimate that value. For financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using
present value and other valuation methods. 

The methods used are greatly affected by the assumptions
applied, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Therefore, the fair values presented may not represent amounts
that could be realized in an exchange for certain financial instruments.

General 

The
Company was incorporated as a mid-tier holding company under the laws of the United States on March 2, 2005, upon the completion of the
reorganization of First Federal of Hazard into a federal mutual holding company form of organization (the Reorganization ).
On that date, Kentucky First Federal also completed its minority stock offering and its concurrent acquisition of Frankfort First Bancorp,
Inc. Frankfort First Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Federal of Kentucky, Frankfort Kentucky First
Federal of Kentucky (the Merger ). Following the Reorganization and Merger, the Company has operated First Federal
of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky (collectively, the Banks as two independent, community-oriented savings institutions. 

On
December 31, 2012, the Company acquired CKF Bancorp, Inc., a savings and loan holding company which operated three banking locations in
Boyle and Garrard Counties in Kentucky. In accounting for the transaction, the assets and liabilities of CKF Bancorp were recorded on
the books of First Federal of Kentucky in accordance with accounting standard ASC 805, Business Combinations. 

Our
results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loans and
securities and our cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected
by the provision for losses on loans and service charges and fees collected on our deposit accounts. Our general, administrative, and
other expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense,
other operating expenses and state and federal income taxes. Results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic
and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.

Asset/Liability Management 

Management and the boards of the subsidiary Banks
are responsible for the asset/liability management issues that affect the individual Banks. Either Bank may work with its sister Bank
to mitigate potential asset/liability risks to the Banks and to the Company as a whole. Management utilizes a third-party to perform
interest rate risk IRR calculations for each of the Banks. Management monitors and considers methods of managing the
rate sensitivity and repricing characteristics of each of the Bank s balance sheet components to maintain acceptable levels of
change in the economic value of equity EVE as well as evaluating the impact on earnings in the event of changes in prevailing
market interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure our interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in
EVE that are a result of changes in the net present value of its cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items. These
changes in cash flow are estimated based on hypothetical instantaneous and permanent increases and decreases in market interest rates. 

In March 2022 the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC of the Federal Reserve Bank began raising the target range for the fed funds rate of interest and since that time has raised the short-term
interest rate by 500 basis points. At September 30, 2023, we believe our risk associated with rising interest rates was moderate. Our
IRR model indicated that at June 30, 2023, our EVE was approximately 16.5 , despite the historic interest rate increases during the previous
twelve months. Although general market participants believe that the FOMC will now pause interest rate increases for a period of time,
our June 30, 2023 EVE is anticipated to be approximately 14.6 and 11.9 under sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest
rates of 100 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively. Computations or prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes
are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments, and deposit run-offs. These
computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the
Banks may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Certain shortcomings are inherent in this method of computing EVE. For
example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in differing degrees
to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes
in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Discussion of Financial Condition Changes from
June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024 

Financial Position and Results of Operations 

At September 30, 2024 the Company and the Banks were considered well-capitalized
with capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements. However, an extended economic recession could adversely impact the Company s
and the Banks capital position and Company in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 15, 2024, in addition to the formal
written Agreement, the OCC has also imposed individual minimum capital requirements IMCRs on First Federal Savings Bank
of Kentucky. The IMCRs require First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky to maintain a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 9.0 ,
a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 11.0 , a total capital ratio of at least 12.0 , and a leverage ratio of at least 9.0 . As of September
30, 2024, First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 16.11 , its tier 1 capital ratio was 16.11 ,
its total capital ratio was 16.11 , and its leverage ratio was 10.07 . 

Assets: At September 30, 2024, the
Company s assets totaled 375.7 million, an increase of 682,000, or 0.2 , from total assets at June 30, 2024, due primarily to
the increase in loans held for sale, as well as an increase in cash and due from financial institutions of 963,000 or 50.3 . 

Cash and cash equivalents: Cash
and cash equivalents overall decreased 1.0 million or 5.6 to 17.3 million at September 30, 2024. Most of the Company s cash and
cash equivalents are held in interest-bearing demand deposits. 

Investment securities: At September
30, 2024, our securities portfolio, which consisted of mortgage-backed securities, decreased 246,000 or 2.5 and totaled 9.6 million,
compared to June 30, 2024. 

Loans : Loans, net and loans
held-for-sale in the aggregate increased 1.5 million or 0.5 and totaled 333.2 million and 1.5 million, respectively at September 30,
2024. Loans receivable, net, increased by 150,000 or 0.1 to 333.2 million at September 30, 2024. Loans held-for-sale increased to 1.4
million at September 30, 2024. Management continues to look for high-quality loans to add to its portfolio and will continue to emphasize
loan originations to the extent that it is profitable, prudent and consistent with our interest rate risk strategies. Because market interest
rates have become more favorable, the Company has had more success in selling mortgages into the secondary market, which has led to an
increase in loans held-for-sale. 

Non-Performing and Classified Loans: At
September 30, 2024, the Company had non-performing loans (loans 90 or more days past due or on nonaccrual status) of approximately 4.3
million, or 1.3 of total loans compared to 3.9 million or 1.2 , of total loans at June 30, 2024. The Company s ACL totaled 2.1
million at September 30, 2024 and the ACL totaled 2.1 million at June 30, 2024, respectively. The ACL at September 30, 2024, represented
50.2 of nonperforming loans and 0.6 of total loans, while at June 30, 2023, ALLL represented 54.6 of nonperforming loans and 0.6 of
total loans. 

The Company had 6.6 million in assets classified
as substandard for regulatory purposes at September 30, 2024, including real estate owned REO of 10,000. Classified loans
as a percentage of total loans (including loans acquired) was 2.0 and 2.1 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Of
substandard loans, 100.0 were secured by real estate on which the Banks have priority lien position. 

The table below shows the aggregate amounts of
our assets classified for regulatory purposes at the dates indicated:

At September 30, 2024, the Company s real

the Company made no loans to facilitate the purchase of its other real estate owned by qualified buyers. Loans to facilitate the sale
of other real estate owned, which were included in substandard loans, totaled 0 and 0 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company
had 785,000 and 797,000 of loans classified as special mention, respectively. This category includes assets which do not currently expose
us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification, but does possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our
close attention. 

Liabilities: Total liabilities
increased 456,000, or 0.1 to 327.4 million at September 30, 2024, as Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased 1.1 million or 1.5 
to 70.1 million and advances to borrowers for taxes and insurance increased 333,000 or 36.6 . 

Certificates of deposit decreased 350,000 or
0.2 and totaled 176.2 million at September 30, 2024, of which 46.0 million were brokered deposits. Demand deposit accounts decreased
 753,000 or 2.3 and totaled 31.4 million at quarter end. Savings accounts decreased 121,000 or 0.3 and totaled 47.3 million at the
end of the current period. The cost of liabilities has been increasing rapidly due to higher costs of both wholesale and retail funding. 
Continued increases in liability costs, especially for wholesale funds, will primarily be driven by future increases in market rates by
the Federal Reserve. It is believed that we are near the peak of this rate cycle which, if so, will likely slow the increasing costs
of our liabilities. 

Shareholders Equity: At September
30, 2024, the Company s shareholders equity totaled 48.2 million, a, increase of 226,000 or 0.5 from the June 30, 2024.
The increase in shareholders equity was primarily associated with accumulated other comprehensive loss decreasing 226,000 or 71.7 
from a loss of 336,000 at June 30, 2024 to a loss of 95,000 at September 30, 2024. 

On January 16, 2024, the Company announced the
suspension of quarterly dividends indefinitely. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of
Directors may declare out of funds available for such payments under applicable law and regulatory guidance. We cannot predict when or
whether the Company will be able to pay future common stock dividends and if so, the amount of any such common stock dividends. Our ability
to pay future dividends and if so at what level will also be dependent on numerous factors, including: our ability to receive any required
regulatory approval or non-objection for the payment of dividends from First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hazard and First
Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky to the Company or from the Company to shareholders; our ability to fully and timely address the deficiencies
that resulted in the Agreement that First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky has entered into with the OCC; First Federal Savings Bank of
Kentucky s ability to satisfy the IMCR s imposed by the OCC; the ability of First Federal MHC to receive approval of its members
to waive the payment of any Company dividends to First Federal MHC; and our ability to successfully execute our strategy to increase earnings
and core deposits, reduce reliance on higher cost funding sources and shift more of our loan portfolio towards higher-earning loans. See
 Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 for
additional discussion regarding dividends.

Kentucky First Federal Bancorp 
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three-month
Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

General 

Net loss totaled 15,000 or 0.00) diluted earnings
per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 160,000 or 91.4 from net loss of 175,000 or 0.02) diluted
earnings per share for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable
to increased net interest income, and higher non-interest income, which were partially offset by lower income tax benefit. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income increased 200,000 or 12.0 
to 1.9 million due primarily to interest income increasing more than interest expense increased period to period. Interest income increased
 886,000 or 23.7 , while interest expense increased 686,000 or 33.2 to 2.8 million for the recently-ended quarter. Over the last two
years, the repricing of many of our assets has been slowed by contractual limits on rate changes, whereas the cost of most liabilities
did not have this constraint. As market rates have steadied and even fallen slightly, the increase in cost of liabilities has slowed while
we have begun to see our increase in interest income be greater than our increase in interest expense. 

The average rate earned on interest-earning assets
increased 69 basis points to 5.05 and was the primary reason for the increase in interest income, although average interest-earning assets
also increased 23.4 million or 6.8 to 365.8 million for the recently-ended quarterly period. The increase in interest income was due
primarily to an increase of 806,000 or 23.3 in interest income from loans, which totaled 4.3 million for the period. 

The increase in interest income from loans period-to-period
was due to increases in both the average balance of loans and the average rate earned on those loans. The average balance of loans increased
 17.4 million or 5.5 to 336.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, while the average rate increased 73 basis points
to 5.08 . 

Although the average balance of interest-bearing
liabilities increased 22.3 million or 7.8 to 309.5 million for the quarter just ended, the average rate paid increased 68 basis points
to 3.55 . The cost of liabilities increased rapidly due to higher costs of both wholesale and retail funding. We have seen interest
rate changes slow and even decrease, allowing the repricing of our liabilities to do the same. 

Net interest spread increased from 1.49 for the
prior year quarterly period to 1.50 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Management determined that a 15,000 provision
for credit loss was prudent in light of the slight increase in the loan portfolio during the recently-ended quarter.

Kentucky First Federal Bancorp 
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three-month
Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (continued) 

Non-interest Income 

Non-interest income increased 63,000 or 85.1 
to 137,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily because of an increase in net
gains on sales of loans as the demand for fixed rate loans has increased in the quarter recently ended. 

Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest expense increased 31,000 or 1.6 
and totaled 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased data processing charges and increased
FDIC insurance premiums. 

Data processing costs increased 31,000 or 23.3 
and totaled 164,000 due to higher fees associated with expanded technology services offered to customers. 

FDIC insurance premiums increased 28,000 or 80.0 
and totaled 63,000 due to overall higher rates. First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky also expects higher FDIC insurance costs due to
the Agreement with the OCC. The continued use of brokered deposits will also cause increased FDIC insurance costs. 

Income Tax Benefit 

Income tax benefit decreased 63,000 or 91.3 from a benefit of 69,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a benefit of 6,000 for the recently-ended period. The effective tax rates for the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 28.6 and 28.3 , respectively.

Kentucky First Federal
Bancorp 

On January 16, 2024, we announced that the
Board had determined to suspend the payment of dividends indefinitely. Our ability to pay future dividends, and the amount that may be
paid, is subject to a number of factors, including our ability to fully and timely address the deficiencies that resulted in the formal
Agreement that First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky has entered into with the OCC and the satisfaction of individual minimum capital
ratio requirements imposed by the OCC. Our ability to pay future dividends is also subject to the ability of First Federal of Hazard and
First Federal of Kentucky to make capital distributions to Kentucky First Federal, and for First Federal MHC to received regulatory and
member approval of the waiver of the receipt of dividends by First Federal MHC. 

On January 16, 2024, the Company announced the
suspension of quarterly dividends indefinitely. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of
Directors may declare out of funds available for such payments under applicable law and regulatory guidance. We cannot predict when or
whether the Company will be able to pay future common stock dividends and if so, the amount of any such common stock dividends. Our ability
to pay future dividends and if so at what level will also be dependent on numerous factors, including: our ability to receive any required
regulatory approval or non-objection for the payment of dividends from First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hazard and First
Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky to the Company or from the Company to shareholders; our ability to fully and timely address the deficiencies
that resulted in the formal Agreement that First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky has entered into with the OCC; First Federal Savings
Bank of Kentucky s ability to satisfy the IMCR s imposed by the OCC; the ability of First Federal MHC to receive approval
of its members to waive the payment of any Company dividends to First Federal MHC; and our ability to successfully execute our strategy
to increase earnings and core deposits, reduce reliance on higher cost funding sources and shift more of our loan portfolio towards higher-earning
loans. For additional information on the formal Agreement that First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky has entered into with the OCC and
the IMCR s imposed on First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky s by the OCC, please see Management s Discussion
and Analysis Regulatory Developments Regarding First Federal of Kentucky. 

Additionally, to address concerns with respect
to the conflict of interest created by dividend waivers, Regulation MM requires the board of directors of a mutual holding company, such
as First Federal MHC, adopt a resolution that describes the conflict of interest that exists because of a director s ownership of
stock in the subsidiary declaring the dividends and any actions the mutual holding company board have taken to eliminate the conflict
of interest, such as the directors waiving their right to receive dividends. Also, the resolution must contain an affirmation that
a majority of the mutual members eligible to vote have, within the 12 months prior to the declaration date of the dividend, voted to approve
the waiver of dividends. 

In previous years, First Federal MHC has received
Federal Reserve Board approval to waive quarterly dividends otherwise payable by the Company totaling 0.40 per share annually beginning
with the dividend paid on September 28, 2012 and continuing through the dividend payable in the third quarter of 2024. However, First
Federal MHC did not seek to obtain regulatory approval to waive dividends for periods after the third quarter of 2024, and the prior Federal
Reserve Boad approval to waive the payment of quarterly dividends that would otherwise be payable to First Federal MHC has expired. To
the extent the Company resumes the payment of dividends in future periods, it is expected that First Federal MHC will again waive future
dividends, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund First Federal MHC s continuing operations, subject to the ability of
First Federal MHC to obtain regulatory approval of its requests to waive dividends and to its ability to obtain member approval of dividend
waivers. We cannot predict whether members will continue to approve annual dividend waiver requests or whether the Federal Reserve Board
will grant future dividend waiver requests and, if granted, there can be no assurance as to the conditions, if any, the Federal Reserve
Board will place on future dividend waiver requests by grandfathered mutual holding companies such as First Federal MHC. If First Federal
MHC is unable to waive the receipt of dividends, the Company s ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be substantially
impaired and the amounts of any such dividends may be significantly reduced.
