At
September 30, 2024, the Corporation had a total of debt securities that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for less
than twelve months with depreciation of from the Corporation s amortized cost basis. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Corporation had a total of debt securities that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for
greater than twelve months with depreciation of from the Corporation s amortized cost basis. 

At
September 30, 2024, unrealized losses on debt securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers bonds are of
high credit quality (rated BBB or higher), management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required
to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest
rates and other market conditions. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no allowance for credit loss ACL was required for debt securities.
The Bank does not have the intent to sell and does not believe it will be more likely than not to be required to sell any of these
securities prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost, which may be at maturity. 

As
of September 30, 2024, all debt securities were rated above investment grade. Based on the payment status, rating and management s
evaluation of these securities, no ACL was required for the debt securities as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024,
the underlying issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities.

Balance, September 30, 2023 

The
Corporation recorded a provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a 172,000 
credit for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Corporation recorded a provision for credit losses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a 594,000 credit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision
for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily as a result of an increase in volume in
the Corporation s loan portfolio as well as changes in qualitative factors related to the nature of the loan portfolio,
volume and severity of past due loans, loan grade migration and changes in lending policies and procedures. The credit for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a result of reduced commercial real estate past dues, reduced balances of commercial
student housing real estate, and slightly improved economic forecasts. 

Total
non-performing assets amounted to at September 30, 2024, as compared to at December 31, 2023. The increase
in non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to one real estate loan
relationship with an aggregate balance of which was placed on nonaccrual status during the first quarter. This relationship
is well secured, and the Bank is working closely with the borrower to bring the relationship to a current status. The Bank does
not expect to incur a credit loss related to this relationship at this time. Overall, non-performing loans remain well controlled
at of total gross loans at September 30, 2024 compared to of total gross loans at December 31, 2023. The Corporation
experienced net charge-offs of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared
to net charge-offs of and net recoveries of 30,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
The allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio provided coverage of non-performing loans, and of total loans,
at September 30, 2024, compared to coverage of non-performing loans, and of total loans, at December 31, 2023. 

Historical
credit loss experience is the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. The Corporation applies historical loss rates
to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. After consideration of the historic loss calculation, management can apply
qualitative adjustments to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportive forecasts not already captured in the
historical loss information at the balance sheet date. 

In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 326, the Corporation will evaluate individual loans for
expected credit losses when those loans do not share similar risk characteristics with loans evaluated using a collective (pooled)
basis. Loans will not be included in both collective and individual analysis. The individual analysis will establish a specific
reserve for loans in scope. 

Specific
reserves are established based on the following three acceptable methods for measuring the ACL:1) the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan s original interest rate; 2) the loan s observable market price; 3) the fair
value of the collateral when the loan is collateral dependent. The method is selected on a loan-by-loan basis with the evaluation
of the need and amount of a specific allocation of the allowance being made on a quarterly basis. 

The
need for an updated appraisal on collateral dependent loans is determined on a case-by-case basis. The useful life of an appraisal
or evaluation will vary depending upon the circumstances of the property and the economic conditions in the marketplace. A new
appraisal is not required if there is an existing appraisal which, along with other information, is sufficient to determine a
reasonable value for the property and to support an appropriate and adequate allowance for credit losses. At a minimum, annual
documented reevaluation of the property is completed by the Bank s Chief Credit Officer to support the value of the property. 

When
receiving an appraisal associated with an existing real estate collateral dependent transaction, the Bank s Chief Credit
Officer must determine if there have been material changes to the underlying assumptions in the appraisal which affect the original
estimate of value. Some of the factors that could cause material changes to reported values include: 

the
 passage of time; 

the
 volatility of the local market; 

the
 availability of financing; 

natural
 disasters; 

the
 inventory of competing properties; 

new
 improvements to, or lack of maintenance of, the subject property or competing properties
 upon physical inspection by the Bank; 

changes
 in underlying economic and market assumptions, such as material changes in current and
 projected vacancy, absorption rates, capitalization rates, lease terms, rental rates,
 sales prices, concessions, construction overruns and delays, zoning changes, etc.; and/or 

environmental
 contamination. 

The
value of the property is adjusted to appropriately reflect the above listed factors and the value is discounted to reflect the
value impact of a forced distressed sale, any outstanding senior liens, any outstanding unpaid real estate taxes, transfer taxes
and closing costs that would occur with sale of the real estate. If the Chief Credit Officer determines that a reasonable value
cannot be derived based on the available information, a new appraisal is ordered. The determination of the need for a new appraisal
rests with the Chief Credit Officer and not the originating account officer.

Credit
Quality Indicators 

The
Bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt
such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic
trends, among other factors. The Bank analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes
non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial real estate, commercial construction, and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis
is performed on a quarterly basis. The Bank uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass.
 Loans which are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying collateral. 

Special
Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If
left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s
credit position at some future date. 

Substandard.
 Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or
of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation
of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies
are not corrected. 

Doubtful.
 Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic
that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,
highly questionable and improbable.

Modifications
to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

Occasionally,
the Bank may consider modifying loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing term extension, other-than-significant payment
delay or interest rate reduction. In some cases, the Bank provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type
of concession, such as an interest rate reduction, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty,
another concession, such as term extension, may be granted. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank did not grant any loan modifications to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty. 

The
carrying amount of foreclosed residential real estate properties held as a result of obtaining physical possession were 70,000
and 0 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The recorded investment of consumer mortgage loans secured by
residential real properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process were and at
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Concentrations
of Credit Risk 

Most
of the Corporation s lending activity occurs within the Bank s primary market area which encompasses Clinton, Columbia,
Lycoming, Montour and Eastern Northumberland counties in Northcentral Pennsylvania. The majority of the Corporation s loan
portfolio consists of commercial and consumer real estate loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no
concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of 10 of total loans.

entirely of stocks held in other banks. The fair values of all debt securities classified as Level II are obtained from nationally-recognized
third-party pricing agencies. The fair values are derived primarily from cash flow models, which include assumptions for interest
rates, credit losses, and prepayment speeds. The significant inputs utilized in the cash flow models are based on market data
obtained from sources independent of the Corporation (observable inputs) and are therefore classified as Level II within the fair
value hierarchy. The fair values of real estate loans held for sale classified as Level II are derived from observable pricing
inputs for similar assets in active markets.

Fair
value is defined as a financial instrument which could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than
in a forced or liquidation sale. If a quoted market price is available for a financial instrument, the estimated fair value would
be calculated based upon the market price per trading unit of the instrument, but focuses on the exit price of the asset and liability. 

If
no readily available market exists, the fair value estimates for financial instruments should be based upon management s
judgment regarding current economic conditions, interest rate risk, expected cash flows, future estimate losses, and other factors
as determined through various option pricing formulas. As many of these assumptions result from judgments made by management based
upon estimates that are inherently uncertain, the resulting estimated fair values may not be indicative of the amount realizable
in the sale of a particular financial instrument. In addition, changes in assumptions on which the estimate fair values are based
may have a significant impact on the resulting estimated fair values.

Item
2. - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD A, represents an overview of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Corporation and should be read in conjunction with the
more detailed and comprehensive disclosures included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In
addition, please read this section in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes to the unaudited
consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1, Financial Statements of Part I to this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q. 

The
Corporation is in the business of providing customary retail, commercial banking and financial services to individuals, businesses
and local governments through its 22 branch offices operated by Journey Bank, the Corporation s wholly-owned subsidiary. The
Corporations 22 branch offices are operated in Clinton, Columbia, Lycoming, Montour and Northumberland counties in central Pennsylvania. 

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT 

Certain
statements in this section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by us under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of us may include forward
looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which reflect our current
views with respect to future events and financial performance. Such forward looking statements are based on general assumptions
and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the
views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not
limited to: 

Our
 business and financial results are affected by business and economic conditions, both
 generally and specifically in the mostly North Central Pennsylvania market in which we
 operate. 

Changes
 in interest rates and valuations in the debt, equity and other financial markets. 

Disruptions
 in the liquidity and other functioning of financial markets, including such disruptions
 in the market for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products. 

Actions
 by the Federal Reserve Board and other government agencies, including those that impact
 money supply and market interest rates. 

Changes
 in our customers and suppliers performance in general and their creditworthiness
 in particular. 

Changes
 in customer preferences and behavior, whether as a result of changing business and economic
 conditions or other factors. 

Changes
 resulting from the enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

A
 continuation of recent turbulence in significant segments of the United States and global
 financial markets, particularly if it worsens, could impact our performance, both directly
 by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities and indirectly
 by affecting our customers and suppliers and the economy generally. 

Our
 business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures
 in the current environment by changes in the competitive landscape. 

Given
 current economic and financial market conditions, our forward-looking statements are
 subject to the risk that these conditions will be substantially different than we are
 currently expecting. 

Legal
 and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses
 or our financial condition or results of operations or our competitive position or reputation.
 Reputational impacts, in turn, could affect matters such as business generation and retention,
 our ability to attract and retain management, liquidity and funding. These legal and
 regulatory developments could include: (a) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings
 or regulatory and other governmental inquiries; (b) increased litigation risk from recent
 regulatory and other governmental developments; (c) the results of the regulatory examination
 process, and regulators future use of supervisory and enforcement tools; (d) legislative
 and regulatory reforms, including changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension,
 education and mortgage lending, the protection of confidential customer information,
 and other aspects of the financial institution industry; and (e) changes in accounting
 policies and principles. 

24 

Our
 business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively
 manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through the effective
 use of third-party insurance and capital management techniques. 

Our
 ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can have an impact on our
 ability to respond to customer needs and to meet competitive demands. 

Our
 ability to implement our business initiatives and strategies could affect our financial
 performance over the next several years. 

Competition
 can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as on our credit
 spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. 

Our
 business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural disasters,
 terrorist activities or international hostilities, either as a result of the impact on
 the economy and capital and other financial markets generally or on us or on our customers
 and suppliers. 

The
words believe, expect, anticipate, project and similar expressions signify
forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements made by or on
behalf of us. Any such statement speaks only as of the date the statement was made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise
any forward looking statements. 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the detailed information and consolidated financial statements,
including notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report. Our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are
essentially those of our subsidiary, the Bank. Therefore, the analysis that follows is directed to the performance of the Bank. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The
Corporation s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and conform to general practices within
the banking industry. In the preparation of its financial statements, the Corporation is required to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Corporation s critical accounting policies
are fundamental to understanding this MD A and are more fully described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies within the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023 . 

The
Corporation defines its critical accounting policies, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires the Corporation to make
subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial
condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which those principles are applied. Application of assumptions
different than those used by the Corporation could result in material changes in the Corporation s financial position or
results of operations. The Corporation believes its policies governing the determination of the allowance for credit/loan losses,
the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
combinations are critical accounting policies. The Corporation s management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting
policies and has discussed these policies with its Audit Committee. The Corporation believes the critical accounting policies
used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows: 

Allowance
for Credit Losses (ACL) - Loans 

As
of January 1, 2023, the Corporation adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments
 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaced
the current loss impairment methodology under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration
of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates in an effort to provide financial statement
users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to
extend credit. ASU 2016-13, commonly referred to as Current Expected Credit Losses CECL ), requires a financial
asset (or a group of financial assets) to be measured at an amortized cost basis and presented at the net amount expected to be
collected. The amendments in this update affect financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted
for at fair value through net income, including such financial assets as loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments
in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from
the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023, the Corporation recorded
an incremental decrease in the ACL through a cumulative effect adjustment to equity, net of tax, with subsequent adjustments charged
to earnings through a provision for credit losses. 

25 

Management
evaluates the credit quality of the Corporation s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis and performs a formal review of the
adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. The ACL is established through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings and
is maintained at a level that management considers to be an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses of the portfolio as
of the evaluation date. Loans, or portions of loans, determined by management to be uncollectible are charged off against the
ACL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ACL. 

Determining
the amount of the ACL is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates
related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical
loss experience and reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as consideration of current economic trends and conditions,
all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination of the Corporation,
also review the ACL, and may require, based on information available to them at the time of their examination, that certain loan
balances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the ACL. Additionally, the ACL is determined, in part, by the composition
and size of the loan portfolio. 

The
ACL consists of two components, a specific component and a general component. The specific component relates to loans that are
individually analyzed for impairment. For such loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value
or observable market price of the loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers all other loans
and is based on historical loss experience as adjusted for qualitative factors. The general reserve component of the ACL is based
on pools of performing loans segregated by loan segment. Historical loss factors are applied based on historical losses in each
risk rating category to determine the appropriate reserve related to those loans. 

Although
the Corporation s management uses the best information available, the level of the ACL remains an estimate which is subject
to significant judgment and short-term change which could have a significant impact on the Corporation s financial condition
or results of operations. From January 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, the level of the ACL increased from 9.3 million to 9.4
million and the ACL to total loans decreased from at 0.87 to 0.85 . The Corporation s ACL is highly sensitive to the methods,
assumptions and estimates underlying its calculation. See Note 4 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses within the
Corporation s Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements which are included in Part I of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for additional qualitative and quantitative information about the Corporation s ACL. 

Fair
Value of Available-For-Sale Debt Securities 

Another
material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the Corporation s debt securities. For the Corporation s debt
securities, the Corporation receives estimated fair values from an independent valuation service, or from brokers. In developing
fair values, the valuation service and the brokers compare securities that have similar maturities, coupon rates, and credit ratings.
Estimated fair values of debt securities may vary among brokers and other valuation services. 

Business
Combinations 

Business
combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. As of acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are measured at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired
entity are included in the consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition. The calculation of intangible assets
including core deposits and the fair value of loans are based on significant judgements. Core deposit intangibles are calculated
using a discounted cash flow model based on various factors including discount rate, attrition rate, interest rate, cost of alternative
funds and net maintenance costs. Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value.
Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected
on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. Management considers a number of factors in evaluating
the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life of the acquired loans, delinquency status, estimated prepayments,
payment options and other loan features, internal risk grade, estimated value of the underlying collateral and interest rate environment. 

MERGER
WITH MUNCY BANK FINANCIAL, INC. 

The
Corporation s merger with Muncy Bank Financial, Inc. MBF was completed November 11, 2023. MBF was a Pennsylvania
corporation that conducted its business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary The Muncy Bank Trust Company, which
operated from a main office in Muncy, Pennsylvania, and had nine additional branches throughout Northcentral Pennsylvania. 

At
the effective time of the merger, MBF s shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.9259 shares of the Corporation s
common stock for each MBF common share they owned, except to the extent of cash received for fractional shares at 41.47 per share.
Total purchase consideration was 55,101,000, including common stock with a fair value of 55,092,000 and cash of 9,000 paid
for fractional shares. Holders of MBF common stock prior to the consummation of the merger held approximately 41.7 of the Corporation s
common stock outstanding immediately following the merger. 

26 

In
connection with the acquisition, effective November 11, 2023, the Corporation recorded goodwill of 17.7 million and a core deposit
intangible asset of 12.1 million. Assets acquired totaled 671.4 million, including gross loans valued at 504.1 million, available-for-sale
debt securities valued at 93.0 million, bank-owned life insurance valued at 17.8 million and premises and equipment, net, valued
at 14.9 million. Liabilities assumed totaled 634.0 million, including deposits valued at 521.3 million and borrowings valued
at 105.5 million. The assets purchased and liabilities assumed in the acquisition were recorded at their preliminary estimated
fair values at the time of closing and may be adjusted for up to one year subsequent to the acquisition. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation incurred pre-tax merger-related expenses related to the MBF
transaction of 43,000 and 340,000, respectively, compared to 757,000 and 1,206,000, respectively, for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Merger-related expenses include voluntary severance and similar expenses as well as expenses related
to conversion of MBF s core banking system into the Corporation s core system and legal and other professional expenses. 

FINANCIAL
CONDITION 

Total
assets at September 30, 2024, were 1.607 billion, a decrease of 32.5 million, or 2.0 from 1.640 billion at December 31, 2023.
The change in total assets primarily reflected decreases in available-for-sale debt securities, restricted investment in bank
stocks and deferred tax assets, net, partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable. Available-for-sale
debt securities decreased 77.8 million, restricted investment in bank stocks decreased 2.9 million and deferred tax assets,
net, decreased 3.7 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased 9.7 million and gross loans receivable increased 44.2 million.
Total liabilities at September 30, 2024, were 1.438 billion, a decrease of 47.9 million, or 3.2 from 1.486 billion at December
31, 2023. Deposit balances increased by 139.8 million, short-term borrowings decreased 179.5 million and long-term borrowings
decreased 10.0 million since December 31, 2023. 

Total
average assets increased 66.0 from 965.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.602 billion for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the MBF merger. Average earning assets were 1.493 billion for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 898.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities
were 1.162 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 697.6 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

Total
average assets increased 65.9 from 958.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.590 billion for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the MBF merger. Average earning assets were 1.490 billion for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 893.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities
were 1.160 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 688.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Available-for-sale
debt securities decreased 77.8 million to 335.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 413.3 million at December 31, 2023. On January
17, 2024, the Corporation sold available-for-sale debt securities with a total market value of 50.3 million, the proceeds of
which were utilized to paydown short-term FHLB borrowings. Securities sold included 34.2 million of US government agency securities,
 15.5 million of mortgaged-backed securities and 563,000 of collateralized mortgage obligations. In addition to the securities
sold, the Corporation received proceeds from paydowns, calls and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of 35.9 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Partially offsetting these changes was an increase in fair value of available-for-sale
debt securities of 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Restricted
investment in bank stocks decreased 2.9 million to 7.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 10.4 million at December 31, 2023.
This decrease is directly attributable to the decrease in required FHLB stock holdings due to the paydown in short and long-term
FHLB borrowings. 

Deferred
tax assets, net, decreased 3.7 million to 8.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 12.6 million at December 31, 2024. This decrease
is primarily related to decreases in deferred tax assets related to unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale debt securities
of 1.7 million and purchase accounting adjustments of 2.1 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cash
and cash equivalents increased 9.7 million or 52.7 from 18.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 28.1 million at September 30,
2024. This increase is primarily related to increased excess cash balances held at the federal reserve, increased branch cash
levels as well as the timing of items clearing through correspondent bank balances. 

Gross
loans not held for sale increased 4.1 to 1.113 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.068 billion at December 31, 2023. This
increase is related to strong loan demand in the first nine months of 2024. 

Interest-bearing
deposits increased 136.3 million to 1.021 billion at September 30, 2024 from 884.7 million at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing
deposits increased 1.3 from 266.0 million at December 31, 2023 to 269.5 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in interest-bearing
deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was as a result of a strategic initiative to reposition customer repurchase
agreements, which are classified as short-term borrowings, into core deposit accounts. The Bank anticipates a continued migration
of customer repurchase accounts from short-term borrowings to interest bearing deposits throughout the remainder of 2024. The
increase in noninterest-bearing deposits was as a result of overall organic deposit growth for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

27 

Short-term
borrowings decreased 179.5 million to 73.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 252.5 million at December 31, 2023. This change
was primarily related to the migration of customer repurchase agreements as well as a paydown in short-term FHLB borrowings during
the quarter as discussed above. 

Long-term
borrowings were 60.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 70.5 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily
related to 10.2 million in long-term borrowing maturities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Total
stockholder s equity increased by 15.5 million, or 10.1 , from 153.8 million at December 31, 2023, to 169.3 million at
September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to earnings, net of cash dividends, along with a decrease in accumulated
other comprehensive loss due to changes in the fair values of available-for-sale debt securities. Accumulated other comprehensive
loss amounted to 8.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and 15.0 million as of December 31, 2023. 

The
loan-to-deposit ratio is a key measurement of liquidity. Our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 92.0 as of December 31, 2023
to 85.5 as of September 30, 2024 due to the asset/liability mix changes noted above, and remains within internal policy limits. 

It
is our opinion that the asset/liability mix and the interest rate risk associated with the balance sheet are within manageable
parameters. Constant monitoring using asset/liability reports and interest rate risk scenarios are in place along with quarterly
asset/liability management meetings on the committee level by the Bank s Board of Directors. Additionally, the Bank s
Asset/Liability Committee meets quarterly with an investment consultant and works with independent third parties regularly to
review key assumptions and other metrics used in the modeling software. 

Securities 

The
Corporation s investment securities portfolio provides a source of liquidity needed to meet expected loan demand and interest
income to increase profitability. Additionally, the investment securities portfolio is used to meet pledging requirements to secure
public deposits, customer repurchase agreements and for other purposes. Debt securities are classified as either available-for-sale
or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase based on management s intent. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value,
with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), net of tax, while held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. At September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, all debt securities were classified as available-for-sale. Equity securities with readily determinable fair
values are carried at fair value, with gains and losses due to fluctuations in market value included in the Consolidated Statements
of Income. Securities with limited marketability and/or restrictions, such as FHLB of Pittsburgh stock, are carried at cost. Decisions
to purchase or sell investment securities are based upon management s current assessment of long- and short-term economic
and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment and asset/liability management, liquidity and tax-planning strategies. 

At
September 30, 2024, the investment portfolio was comprised principally of available-for-sale debt securities including, fixed-rate,
taxable and tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions and fixed-rate and floating-rate securities issued
by U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored agencies, which include agencies, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
mortgage obligations, or CMOs. Additionally, the Corporation holds equity investments in the stock of certain publicly traded
bank holding companies. Except for U.S. government and government-sponsored agencies, there were no securities of any individual
issuer that exceeded 10.0 of stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024. 

The
majority of the Corporation s debt securities are fixed-rate instruments and inherently subject to interest rate
risk, as the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates with changes in interest rates. Generally, a security s value reacts inversely
with changes in interest rates. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported
in the accumulated other comprehensive income or loss component of stockholder s equity, net of deferred income taxes. At September
30, 2024, the Corporation reported a net unrealized loss, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, of 8.8 million,
net of deferred income taxes of 2.4 million, a decrease of 3.8 million compared to the net unrealized holding loss
of 15.0 million, net of deferred income taxes of 4.0 million, at December 31, 2023. Any future changes in interest rates
could result in changes in the fair value of the Corporation s securities portfolio and capital position. However, accumulated
other comprehensive income and loss related to available-for-sale debt securities is excluded from regulatory capital and does
not have an impact on the Corporation s regulatory capital ratios.

Loan
concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that
would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Our lending activity is heavily concentrated in the
geographic market areas we serve. This geographic concentration subjects our loan portfolio to the general economic conditions
within the state. The risks created by this concentration have been considered by management and are monitored on an ongoing basis.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10 of total loans other than
the categories of loans disclosed in the table above. We believe our loan portfolio is diversified relative to industry concentrations
across the various loan portfolio categories. 

Banking
regulators have established guidelines of less than 100 of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in construction lending
and less than 300 of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in commercial real estate lending that management monitors
as part of the risk management process. The construction concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding construction and
land development loans to total tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. The commercial real estate concentration ratio
is a percentage of the outstanding balance of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily, and construction and land
development loans to tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s exposure to commercial
real estate was well below these guidelines. 

As
of September 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans totaled 360.3 million or 32.3 of total gross loans. Of this amount commercial
mortgage loans represented 319.7 million or 28.7 of total gross loans and student housing loans represented 40.6 million or
3.6 of total gross loans. The following table presents the distribution of commercial
mortgage loans and related percentage of the total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Corporation s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 

Asset
Quality 

Loans
that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount
of unpaid principal, net of deferred loan fees and costs, and reduced by the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit
losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. 

The
Corporation has established and consistently applies loan policies and procedures designed to foster sound underwriting and credit
monitoring practices. Credit risk is managed through the efforts of loan officers, the Chief Credit Officer, the loan review function,
as well as oversight from the Board of Directors. Management continually evaluates its credit risk management practices to ensure problems
in the loan portfolio are addressed in a timely manner, although, as is the case with any financial institution, a certain degree
of credit risk is dependent in part on local and general economic conditions that are beyond management s control. Under
the Corporation s risk rating system, loans are rated pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss, with all categories
reviewed regularly as part of the risk management practices. 

Non-performing
loans are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the Corporation s loan review process. Additionally, work-outs for non-performing
loans and foreclosed assets held for sale are actively monitored through the Bank s Credit Department. A potential loss
on a non-performing asset is generally determined by comparing the outstanding loan balance to the fair market value of the pledged
collateral, less estimated cost to sell. 

Management
actively manages non-performing loans in an effort to mitigate loss to the Corporation by working with customers to develop strategies
to resolve borrower difficulties, through sale or liquidation of collateral, foreclosure and other appropriate means. In addition,
management monitors employment and economic conditions within its market area, as weakening of conditions could result in real
estate devaluations and an increase in loan delinquencies, which could negatively impact asset quality and cause an increase in
the provision for credit losses. 

The
following table presents information about non-performing assets, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Total
non-performing assets amounted to 8,575,000, or 0.53 of total assets at September 30, 2024, as compared to 4,476,000, or 0.27 
of total assets at December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in non-performing assets was
primarily attributable to one real estate loan relationship with an aggregate balance of 2,221,000 which was placed on nonaccrual
status during the first quarter. This relationship is well secured, and the Bank is working closely with the borrower to bring
the relationship to a current status. The Bank does not expect to incur a credit loss related to this relationship at this time. 

Allowance
for Credit Losses 

The
allowance for credit losses was 9.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.3 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance
equaled 0.85 of total loans, net of unearned fees and costs and unamortized fair value adjustments, at September 30, 2024 as
compared to 0.87 of total loans at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was analyzed quarterly and reviewed by
the Corporation s Board of Directors. No concentration or apparent deterioration in classes of loans or pledged collateral
was evident. Regular loan meetings with the Corporation s Board of Directors reviewed new loans. Delinquent loans, loan
exceptions and certain large loans are addressed by the full Board no less than monthly to determine compliance with policies. 

The
following tables present the allocation of the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Deposits 

Deposits
are the primary source of funds for the Corporation s lending and investing activities. The Corporation provides a range
of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking
accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. These accounts generally earn interest at rates the Corporation
establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. The establishment or continuity of
a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. While the Corporation s primary focus is on establishing
customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the Corporation may use brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits
to supplement its funding sources. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation held no brokered deposits. 

The
following tables summarize the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits for
the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

The
Corporation believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships.
The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was 1.92 and 0.54 ,
respectively. The increased cost was primarily attributable to the increases in rates and increased pricing competition. The
average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was 1.79 and 0.46 , respectively.
The increased cost was primarily attributable to the increases in rates and increased pricing competition. 

At
September 30, 2024, estimated uninsured deposits, or the portion of deposit accounts which exceeded the Federal Deposit Corporation
insurance limit, totaled 366.0 million. Of this amount, 155.1 million was collateralized by securities pledged by the Corporation
or letters of credit issued through the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Time deposits of 250,000 or more totaled approximately
 109.5 million at September 30, 2024. 

See
Note 5 within the Corporation s Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements which are included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Corporation s deposits as of September 30, 2024. 

Borrowings 

Short-term
borrowings consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and periodic overnight or short-term Federal Home
Loan Bank advances. Average short-term borrowings amounted to 7.9 and 11.8 of total interest-bearing liabilities for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 27.7 and 27.2 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, respectively. This change was primarily related to the migration of customer repurchase agreements as well as a paydown
in short-term FHLB borrowings during 2024 as discussed above. 

Long-term
borrowings consist of advances due to the FHLB - Pittsburgh. Under terms of a blanket agreement, the loans are secured by certain
qualifying assets of the Bank which consist principally of first mortgage loans. The carrying value of these collateralized items
was 820.8 million at September 30, 2024. The Bank has lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window, FHLB 
Pittsburgh, and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank in the aggregate amount of 587.3 million at September 30, 2024. The unused portion
of these lines of credit was 469.9 million at September 30, 2024.

Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Corporation s borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 

Capital
Resources 

Management
believes, as of September 30, 2024, that Journey Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Management
annually performs stress testing on its regulatory capital levels and expects Journey Bank to maintain capital levels that exceed
the regulatory standards for well-capitalized institutions for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Future
dividend payments and repurchases of common stock will depend upon maintenance of a strong financial condition, future earnings
and capital and regulatory requirements. In addition, Journey Bank is subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends that
may be paid without approval of banking regulatory authorities. Further, although Muncy Columbia Financial Corporation is not
subject to the specific consolidated capital requirements, its ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in other activities
may be limited by the Federal Reserve if it fails to hold sufficient capital commensurate with its overall risk profile.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Net
income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 5,056,000, or 1.42 per share compared to net income of 1,171,000, or 0.56
per share for the same period in 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13,799,000, or 3.86 per share
compared to 4,573,000, or 2.20 per share for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily attributable to the MBF merger. 

Net
interest income increased 7.9 million, or 161.2 to 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.9 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-interest income was 2.7 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024, an increase of 1.2 million, or 78.4 , from 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily
related to increases in service charges and fees, gains (losses) on marketable equity securities, interchange fees and other non-interest
income. Non-interest expense was 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.1 million,
or 77.6 , from 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily related to increases in expenses
related to the MBF merger. 

Net
interest income increased 22.1 million, or 147.0 to 37.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 15.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-interest income was 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, an increase of 2.8 million, or 57.9 , from 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily
related to increases in service charges and fees, interchange fees and other non-interest income. Non-interest expense was
 28.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 13.3 million, or 88.7 , from 14.9 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily related to increases in expenses related to the MBF merger. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the annualized return on average assets was 1.26 and 1.13 , respectively,
compared to 0.63 and 0.69 for the respective periods of 2023. The annualized return on average equity was 12.34 and
11.39 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 6.78 and 7.35 , respectively, for the comparable
periods of 2023. The Corporation declared and paid dividends to holders of common stock of 0.44 per share for the third
quarter of 2024 and 1.32 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.43 and 1.28 per share,
respectively, for the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods of 2023.

Net
Interest Income 

Net
interest income is the difference between (i) interest income, interest and fees on interest-earning assets, and (ii) interest
expense, interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income represents the largest component of the Corporation s
operating income and, as such, is the primary determinant of profitability. Net interest income is impacted by variations in the
volume, rate and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in general market interest rates and
the level of non-performing assets. Interest income is shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis using the corporate statutory tax
rate of 21.0 in 2024 and 2023. 

Net
interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased 8.1 million, or 161.9 , to 13.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 from 5.0 million for the comparable period of 2023. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income primarily
reflected an increase in tax equivalent interest income of 12.6 million, or 148.5 , to 21.1 million from 8.5 million,
comparing the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 4.5
million, to 8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.5 million for the same quarter of 2023. The tax-equivalent
net interest margin, a key measurement used in the banking industry to measure income from earning assets relative to the cost
to fund those assets, is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average interest-earning assets. The Corporation s
tax-equivalent net interest margin increased 127 basis points to 3.48 for the third quarter of 2024 from 2.21 for
the same quarter of 2023. Additionally, rate spread, the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets
and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis, increased 110 basis points to 2.87 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.77 for the same three months of 2023. 

The
 12.6 million, or 148.5 , increase in tax-equivalent interest income comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 largely reflected an increase in the tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets, coupled with significant growth
in average earning assets related to the MBF merger. The tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets increased 187 basis points
to 5.62 for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.75 for the same quarter of 2023, which resulted in a corresponding 5.1 million
increase to tax-equivalent interest income. Specifically, the tax-equivalent yield on the loan portfolio increased 167 basis
points to 6.64 from 4.97 comparing the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, which was due primarily to net accretion of loan fair
value adjustments recorded in conjunction with the MBF merger as well as the continued repricing of existing loans in the Corporation s
portfolio. Additionally, the tax-equivalent yield on the investment portfolio increased 70 basis points to 2.44 for the third
quarter of 2024 from 1.74 for the same quarter of 2023. These yield increases resulted in corresponding increases in tax-equivalent
interest income of 4.7 million, and 341,000, respectively. Additionally, total average earning assets increased 595.0 million,
or 66.2 , to 1.493 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 898.2 million for the same three months of 2023,
which resulted in a corresponding increase in tax-equivalent interest income of 7.5 million. Specifically, average
total loans increased 569.9 million, or 102.9 , to 1.124 billion for the third quarter of 2024 from 554.0 million
for the same quarter of 2023, which largely reflected the impact of the MBF merger along with strong organic loan demand. The
increase in the average loan balances resulted in a corresponding increase to tax-equivalent interest income of 7.1 million
comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Meanwhile, total securities averaged 361.4 million for the
third quarter of 2024, an increase of 23.5 million, or 6.9 , from 338.0 million for the same quarter of 2023,
which caused a corresponding increase to tax-equivalent interest income of 412,000. 

The
increase in interest expense of 4.5 million was primarily due to an increase in funding costs, coupled with growth
in average interest-bearing liabilities. The Corporation experienced a 76 basis point increase in the cost of funds to 2.75 
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.99 for the same three months of 2023, which resulted in a corresponding
increase in interest expense of 3.9 million. The Corporation increased deposit rates and offered promotional certificate of deposit
rates in response to rising market rates and increased competition. Specifically, the average rate paid for interest-bearing deposits
increased 168 basis points to 2.42 for the third quarter of 2024 from 0.74 for the same period of 2023, resulting in a
corresponding increase to interest expense of 3.8 million. The average rates paid on interest bearing demand deposits increased
218 basis points, resulting in a corresponding increase to interest expense of 1.9 million. Comparing the third quarters
of 2024 and 2023, the average rates paid for money market deposits and time deposits, increased 75 basis points
and 190 basis points, respectively, resulting in corresponding increases to interest expense of 217,000 and 1.7 million, respectively. 
Additionally, the Corporation experienced an increase in wholesale borrowing costs. Comparing the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the average rate paid for borrowed funds increased 9 basis points to 4.83 from 4.74 , respectively, and
resulted in a corresponding increase to interest expense of 83,000. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 464.3
million, or 66.6 , to 1.162 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 697.6 million for the same three
months of 2023. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted in a corresponding increase to interest expense
of 632,000. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 527.2 million, or 110.0 , to 1.007 billion from 479.4 million comparing
the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits resulted in a corresponding
increase to interest expense of 1.4 million. Average time deposits increased 215.7 million, or 167.1 , to 344.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 129.0 million for the same three months of 2023, due to the
MBF merger as well as changing customer deposit preferences due to the economic and rate environment continued to result
in deposit migration from non-maturity deposits to higher-costing time deposits. The increase in average time deposit balances
resulted in additional interest expense of 1.1 million. Partially offsetting the increase in interest expense due to higher deposit
balances was a reduction in total borrowings. Average total borrowings decreased 62.9 million, or 28.8 , to 155.2
million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 218.1 million for the same quarter of 2023, resulting in a decrease
in interest expense of 805,000. 

35 

On
a year-to-date basis, tax equivalent net interest income increased 22.6 million, or 148.0 , to 37.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, from 15.3 million for the comparable period of 2023. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income
for the year-to-date period was largely due to a 37.5 million, or 154.5 , increase in tax equivalent interest income, to 61.7
million, from 24.3 million for 2023, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 14.8 million, or
165.7 , to 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. Similar to the quarterly period, the 22.6 million or 148.0 , increase in year-to-date tax equivalent interest income
was primarily due to higher earning-asset yields, coupled with an increase in average earning assets balances primarily related
to the MBF merger. The tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets increased 191 basis points to 5.54 for the first nine
months of 2024 from 3.63 for the same period in 2023, which resulted in a corresponding increase of 22.6 million to tax-equivalent
interest income. The tax-equivalent yield on loans increased 174 basis points, while the tax-equivalent yield on investments increased
77 basis points comparing the year-to-date periods of 2024 and 2023, which resulted in corresponding increases in tax-equivalent
interest income of 21.2 million and 1.3 million, respectively. Regarding earning-asset volumes, total average earning assets
increased 596.0 million, or 66.7 , to 1.490 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 893.5 million for the
same period of 2023, which resulted in a corresponding increase in tax-equivalent interest income of 14.9 million. Similar to
the quarterly period, this was primarily due to an increase in average total loans which increased 564.5 million, or 103.3 ,
to 1.111 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 546.2 million` for the same comparable period of 2023, which
was primarily as a result of the MBF merger and strong organic loan demand. This increase resulted in a corresponding increase
in tax-equivalent interest income of 13.7 million. 

The
 14.8 million, or 165.7 , increase in year-to-date interest expense was largely due to higher funding costs, coupled with an increase
in average interest-bearing liabilities related to the MBF merger. The Corporation experienced a 100 basis point increase in
the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 2.74 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1.74 for the same period
of 2023, which resulted in a corresponding increase to interest expense of 12.5 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 165 basis points, to 2.28 , compared to 0.63 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. This resulted in a corresponding increase to interest expense of 11.7 million. Average
interest-bearing liabilities increased 471.4 million, or 68.4 , to 1.160 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
from 688.8 million for the same nine months of 2023, resulting in a corresponding increase to interest expense of 2.4 million.
Comparing the year-to-date periods of 2024 and 2023, average interest-bearing deposits increased 467.8 million, or 95.8 , to
 956.3 million from 488.5 million, respectively, increasing interest expense by 2.4 million. Average total borrowings increased
 3.6 million, or 1.8 , to 203.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 200.3 million for
the same period of 2023, resulting in an increase in interest expense of 23,000.

Provision
(Credit) for Credit Losses - Loans 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded a 151,000 and 288,000 provision for credit losses
on loans, respectively, compared to a 172,000 and 594,000 credit, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses primarily reflects an increase
in volume in the loan portfolio along with changes in qualitative factors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
the credit was primarily related to improved economic forecasts and ongoing low charge-off experience. 

See
Note 4 within the Corporation s Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements which are included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Corporation s allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024.

Non-interest
Income 

Total
non-interest income increased 1.2 million or 78.4 to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the three months ended September 30, 2023. Service charges and fees increased 250,000 due to an increased number of accounts
and increased transaction volumes due to the MBF merger. Earnings on bank-owned life insurance increased 123,000 or 108.8 from
 113,000 to 236,000 due to an increase in cash surrender values related to the MBF merger. Gains (losses) on marketable equity
securities increased 281,000 or 238.1 due to an increase in the fair value of equity securities held during the third quarter.
Interchange fees increased 236,000 or 55.1 due to an increase in the volume of transactions due to the MBF merger and continued
increase in electronic payments. Other non-interest income increased 201,000 or 94.4 due primarily to increases in merchant
services income and secondary market mortgage servicing fees. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest income increased 2.8 million or 57.9 to 7.7 million, compared
to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Similar to the quarterly period, increases in service charges and
fees, earnings on bank-owned life insurance and interchange fees of 493,000, 357,000 and 676,000, respectively, were all related
to the MBF merger. Gains (losses) on marketable equity securities increased 273,000 or 103.0 due to an increase in the fair
value of equity securities held during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other non-interest income increased 746,000
or 100.4 due primarily to incentives received in conjunction with the launch of a debit card reissuance project as well as a
governmental grant recorded in the first quarter in conjunction with the completion of a solar energy project.

LIQUIDITY 

The
Bank s liquidity, represented by cash and due from banks, is a product of its operating, investing and financing activities.
The Bank s primary sources of funds are deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, principal repayments of
securities and outstanding loans, funds provided from operations, and day-to-day FHLB Pittsburgh borrowings. In addition,
the Bank invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets such as overnight deposits or U.S. agency securities, which
provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and securities and short-term
investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence
deposit flows and repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities. 

The
Bank strives to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund operations, loan demand and to satisfy fluctuations in deposit levels. The
Bank is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure
safe and sound banking operations. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative
yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. The Bank attempts to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity,
and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of its business management. The Bank manages its liquidity in
accordance with a board of directors-approved asset liability policy, which is administered by its asset-liability committee ALCO ).
ALCO reports interest rate sensitivity, liquidity, capital and investment-related matters on a quarterly basis to the Bank s
board of directors. 

41 

The
Bank reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the
requirements of normal operations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit
and savings withdrawals. While deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are its primary source of funds, when
needed it is also able to generate cash through borrowings from the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had remaining available
capacity with FHLB, subject to certain collateral restrictions, of 451.1 million. 

Liquidity
management is required to ensure that adequate funds will be available to meet anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals,
debt service payments, investment commitments, commercial and consumer loan demand, and ongoing operating expenses. Funding sources
include principal repayments on loans, sale of assets, growth in time and core deposits, short and long-term borrowings, investment
securities coming due, loan prepayments and repurchase agreements. Regular loan payments are a dependable source of funds, while
the sale of investment securities, deposit growth and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general economic conditions
and the level of interest rates. 

The
statement of cash flows presents the change in cash and cash equivalents from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash
and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, are the Corporation s
most liquid assets. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 28.1 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 9.7 million, or
52.7 , from 18.4 million at December 31, 2023, as net cash inflows from operating and investing activities were greater
than net cash outflows from financing activities. 

Net
cash inflows from investing activities provided 52.8 million of cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Accounting for the majority of the net cash inflows was 86.2 million related to proceeds from sales, paydowns,
calls and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities. This was partially offset by a net increase in loans and leases of
 36.5 million, which reflected strong demand. Financing activities used 55.5 million in net cash, which resulted primarily
from a decrease in short-term borrowings, consisting of customer repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB borrowings, of
 179.5 million. These outflows were offset by a 138.8 million increase in deposits. These changes were primarily
related to a strategic initiative to reposition customer repurchase agreements into core deposit accounts. Operating activities
include net income, adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions including, among others, depreciation and amortization and
the provision for credit losses, and is the primary source of cash flows from operations. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, operating activities provided the Corporation with 12.4 million in net cash, which primarily reflected net
income of 13.8 million. 

The
Corporation regularly analyzes its ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its short and long-term cash requirements
and plans. As part of its quarterly asset liability management procedures, the Corporation performs liquidity cash flow forecasts
in various base level and stress scenarios to monitor future cash needs. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation is expected
to maintain a level cash balance over the next 12 months. The Corporation has not identified any known demands, commitments, events
or uncertainties that would result or that are reasonably likely to result in its liquidity position materially increasing or
decreasing over the next 12 months. The Corporation s long-term cash needs are regularly analyzed through its strategic
planning process, which includes a detailed review of liquidity and funding needs. 

We
manage liquidity on a daily basis. We believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet present and future financial obligations
and commitments on a timely basis. However, see potential liquidity risk factors at Item 1A Risk Factors of the Corporation s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this
Form 10-Q. 

INTEREST
RATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Interest
rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities are matched.
Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and earnings volatility due to the repricing characteristics
of assets and liabilities. The Bank's net interest income is affected by changes in the level of market interest rates. In order
to maintain consistent earnings performance, the Bank seeks to manage, to the extent possible, the repricing characteristics of
its assets and liabilities. 

One
major objective of the Bank when managing the rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities is to stabilize net interest income.
The management of and authority to assume interest rate risk is the responsibility of the Bank's ALCO, which is comprised of senior
management and Board members. ALCO meets quarterly to monitor the ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities.
The process to review interest rate risk management is a regular part of management of the Bank. Consistent policies and practices
of measuring and reporting interest rate risk exposure, particularly regarding the treatment of noncontractual assets and liabilities,
are in effect. In addition, there is an annual process to review the interest rate risk policy with the Board of Directors which
includes limits on the impact to earnings from shifts in interest rates. 

42 

The
ratio between assets and liabilities repricing in specific time intervals is referred to as an interest rate sensitivity gap.
Interest rate sensitivity gaps can be managed to take advantage of the slope of the yield curve as well as forecasted changes
in the level of interest rate changes. 

To
manage the interest sensitivity position, an asset/liability model called "gap analysis" is used to monitor the difference
in the volume of the Bank's interest sensitive assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within given periods. A positive
gap (asset sensitive) indicates that more assets reprice during a given period compared to liabilities, while a negative gap (liability
sensitive) has the opposite effect. The Bank employs computerized net interest income simulation modeling to assist in quantifying
interest rate risk exposure. This process measures and quantifies the impact on net interest income through varying interest rate
changes and balance sheet compositions. The use of this model assists the ALCO to gauge the effects of the interest rate changes
on interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to determine what impact these rate changes will have upon our net interest
spread. At Setptember 30, 2024, our cumulative gap positions were within the internal risk management guidelines. 

In
addition to gap analysis, the Bank uses net interest income simulations and economic value of equity EVE simulations
as the primary tools in measuring and managing the Bank s position and considers balance sheet forecasts, the Bank s
liquidity position, the economic environment, anticipated direction of interest rates and the Bank s earnings sensitivity
to changes in these rates in its modeling. In addition, ALCO has established policy tolerance limits for acceptable negative changes
in net interest income. Furthermore, as part of its ongoing monitoring, ALCO requires annual back testing of modeling results,
which involves after-the-fact comparisons of projections with the Bank s actual performance to measure the validity of assumptions
used in the modeling techniques. 

The
following table illustrates the simulated impact of parallel and instantaneous interest rate shocks of +100, +200, +300, -100,
-200, and -300 basis points on net interest income and the change in economic value over a one-year time horizon from the September
30, 2024 levels:

Model
results from the simulation at September 30, 2024 indicated that the Bank was projected to see an increase in net interest
income over a one-year horizon in any of the rate shock scenarios, with the exception of the +300 scenario, which showed a 2.74 
decrease. The percent change in EVE is expected to decrease in all rates up scenarios and increase in all rates down scenarios. All
modeled exposures to net interest income and EVE for the next twelve-month horizon are within internal ALCO policy guidelines. 

This
analysis does not represent a forecast for the Bank and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results.
These simulations are based on numerous assumptions, including but not limited to, the nature and timing of interest rate
levels, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacements
of asset and liability cash flows, and other factors. While assumptions reflect current economic and local market conditions,
the Bank cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions, including changes in interest rates, customer
preferences, competition and liquidity needs, or what actions ALCO might take in responding to these changes. 

It
is our opinion that the asset/liability mix and the interest rate risk associated with the balance sheet is within manageable
parameters. Additionally, the Bank s ALCO meets quarterly with an asset liability management consultant. 

IMPACT
OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to measure the Corporation s financial
position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation
or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on the Corporation's operations is primarily related
to increases in operating expenses. Management considers changes in interest rates to impact our financial condition and results
of operations to a far greater degree than changes in prices due to inflation. Although interest rates are greatly influenced
by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate.
The Corporation manages interest rate risk in several ways. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will not be materially
adversely affected by future changes in interest rates, as interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond
its control. Additionally, inflation may adversely impact the financial condition of the Corporation's borrowers and could impact
their ability to repay their loans, which could negatively affect the Corporation's asset quality through higher delinquency rates
and increased charge-offs. Management will carefully consider the impact of inflation and rising interest rates on the Corporation s
borrowers in managing credit risk related to the loan portfolio.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The
information called for by this item can be found at Part I Item 2 of this Report on Form 10-Q under the caption Interest
Rate Risk Management and is incorporated in its entirety by reference under this Item 3. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Our
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), based on their evaluation of
these controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report, were effective as of such date at the reasonable
assurance level as discussed below to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. In addition, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion
of two or more people or by management override of the controls. 

The
CEO and CFO have evaluated the changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal Quarter
Ended September 30, 2024, as required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and have concluded that there were no changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting.
