with the Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. On January 16, 2022, the members of
Public Ventures contributed their entire interests in the equity of Public Ventures, and their then equity interests in Invizyne and

Investment
securities, at amortized cost: The fair value of U.S. Treasury Bills classified as held-to-maturity investment securities is based on
the market price and is classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

A
description of the valuation techniques applied to the Company s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis is as follows: 

Investment
securities: Public equity securities are assessed for valuation at the close of each month. Warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes
model, which considers the stock price at the date of the valuation, the warrants strike price, the term to expiry, the risk-free rate
of return, and the expected volatility of the underlying stock. 

Investment
securities, at cost less impairment: Non-public equity securities and simple agreements for future equity are valued based on the initial
investment, less impairment. The Company determined that no impairment was warranted. Since these securities are not actively traded,
we will apply valuation adjustments when they become available, and they are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Private
placement fees are related to non-underwritten transactions such as private placements of equity securities, private investments in public
equity, and Rule 144A private offerings and are recorded on the closing date of the transaction. Client reimbursements for costs associated
for private placement fees are recorded gross within investment banking and various expense captions, excluding compensation. The Company
typically receives payments on private placements transactions at the completion of the contract. The Company views the majority of placement
fees as a single performance obligation that is satisfied when the transaction is complete, and the revenue is recognized at that point
in time. 

Taxes
and regulatory fees assessed by a government authority or agency that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specified revenue-producing
transaction, which are collected by Public Ventures from a customer, are excluded from revenue and recorded against general and administrative
expenses. 

PatentVest
recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods and services to customers in an amount the
Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. PatentVest enters into contracts that can include various combinations
of its offerings, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation for the entre
contract or a portion of the contract. When performance obligations are combined into a single contract, PatentVest utilizes a stand-alone
selling price to allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations. 

Certain
contracts or portions of contracts are duration-based which, in the event of customer cancellation, provide PatentVest with an enforceable
right to a proportional payment for the portion of the services provided. Accordingly, revenue from duration-based is recognized using

in October 2023, Invizyne made changes to a second existing lease agreement that was originally entered into in April 2023, which resulted
in an extension of the lease term by an additional months. The revised lease maintained the same escalation rate for lease payments
as the previous arrangement. To account for this modification, the Company reevaluated the remaining lease term at the time of execution.
As the Company was actively utilizing the premises, adjustments were made to reflect the revaluation of both the right-to-use asset and
the corresponding lease liability in line with the updated lease term. This was originally entered into in April 2023, with a term of

assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company s
obligation to make lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on
the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company s uses the implicit rate in its lease calculations when it
is readily determinable. Since the Company s leases do not provide implicit rates, to determine the present value of lease payments,
management uses the Company s estimated incremental borrowing rate for a fully collateralized loan with a similar term of the lease
that is based on the information available at the inception of the lease.

In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. At the end of 2023,
the Company s corporate earnings were in a cumulative loss position. Based on the cumulative losses and projections of future taxable
income for the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against all its net
deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023. The Company intends to maintain a full valuation allowance on its net deferred
tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. The amount of deferred
tax assets considered realizable could materially increase in the future, and the amount of valuation allowance recorded could materially
decrease if estimates of future taxable income are increased.

Operating
Income. For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, there were unrealized losses primarily related to
stock and warrants received in prior investment banking transactions. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, operating
income was generated from the self-clearing operations in the broker-dealer and intellectual property service segment. For the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, operating income was generated from the Company s fee from an investment banking
transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024 in the broker-dealer and intellectual property service segment. For the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, operating income was generated from the Company s fee income and
unrealized gains related to warrants received as compensation for investment banking services in the second quarter of 2023 in the
broker-dealer and intellectual property service segment. 

34 

General
and Administrative Costs . During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, several
factors contributed to changes in various expense categories: 

Compensation
 Expense: The majority of the increase in compensation expense was due to the recognition of restricted stock units, as well as the
 ongoing recruitment of additional employees in the latter half of 2023, specifically within the technology segment, to support expected
 operational growth. 

Related
 Party Operating Expenses: The rise in related party operating expenses was due to outsourcing support services in anticipation of
 upcoming self-clearing operations within the broker-dealer and intellectual property service segments for 2024. 

Professional
 Fees: Professional fees saw an increase from previous periods, driven by higher costs in legal, tax, audit, and consulting services.
 This rise in expenses was primarily linked to the audit fees, tax return preparations, and K-1s associated with fiscal year 2023
 reporting, along with initiation of the self-clearing operations. 

Information
 Technology Costs: Information technology costs saw an increase from previous periods, driven by higher costs associated with the
 initiation of the self-clearing operations, as well as increased cloud computing costs. 

Clearing
 and Other Charges: Clearing and other charges fluctuate with broker dealer activity, generally correlating to fee income. For the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, there was limited activity. A decrease in fee income for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 resulted in a corresponding decrease in
fee income for the current period. 

Other
 General and Administrative Costs: The primary driver of the increase in other general and administrative costs was the issuance
 of restricted stock options to the board of directors, as well as higher rent expenses in the technology segment compared to the
 previous period. 

Research
and Development Costs . Research and development costs were derived from the Company s technology development segment.
For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, there was an increase in research and development costs due to a decrease of grant funding. It is important to note that the upswing in grant funding was not linked to any specific
event and is expected to fluctuate throughout the year. 

Other
Income . For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, the increase in other income was the
result of interest generated on U.S. Treasury Bill interest earned on capital raised in the initial public offering. 

Income
Taxes . For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, the decrease in income taxes was a direct
result of the reduction in fee income as compared to the three and nine-month periods ended, September 30, 2023, respectively.

Operating
Income. For the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, there were unrealized losses primarily related to
investment securities and to warrants previously received as fees for in investment banking activities. For the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024, operating income was generated from the self-clearing operations of the broker-dealer and intellectual
property service segment. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, operating income was generated from fees earned on the
broker-dealer s investment banking activities and at the intellectual property service segment. For the three-month and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, operating income was generated from the Company s fee income and unrealized gains
related to warrants received as fees for investment banking activity in the second quarter of 2023 in the broker-dealer, and
fees earned at the intellectual property service segment. 

General
and Administrative Costs . During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, several
factors contributed to changes in various expense categories: 

Compensation
 Expense: The increase in compensation expense was driven by an increase in salaries in early 2024. 

Related
 Party Operating Expenses: There was an increase in related party operating expenses as outsourcing support was increased within the
 broker-dealer and intellectual property service segment. 

Professional
 Fees: There was an increase in professional fees compared to the previous periods, primarily due to increased consulting, legal, and
 tax. Furthermore, there was an increase in consulting fees associated with the implementation of self-clearing operations. 

Information
 Technology Costs: Information technology costs saw an increase from previous periods, driven by higher costs with the initiation
 of self-clearing operations and increased cloud computing costs. 

Clearing
 and Other Charges: Clearing and other charges fluctuate with broker dealer activity, generally correlating to fee income. For the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, there was limited activity. A decrease in fee income for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 resulted in a corresponding decrease in
fee income for the current period. 

Other
 General and Administrative Costs: The rise in other general and administrative costs was due to higher expenses in advertising and
 promotions, increased spending on travel and conferences, as well as rent allocation to the broker-Dealer. 

Other
Income . For the three and nine-month periods ended, September 30, 2024, respectively, the rise in the interest expense
is due to inter-company subordinated loans for the broker-dealer and is eliminated for consolidation purposes. There was an increase
in interest income due to the broker-dealer having increased funds held in high-yield money market accounts. 

Income
Taxes . For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 there was no revenue activity requiring tax accrual. For the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in income taxes was a direct result of the reduction in fee income as compared to the three
and nine-month periods ended, September 30, 2023.

Operating
Income. For the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, the decline in operating income was primarily due to a one-off
feasibility study that was conducted in the previous period. 

39 

General
and Administrative Costs . During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, several factors
contributed to changes in various expense categories: 

Compensation
 Expense: The increase in compensation expense stemmed from the recruitment of additional administrative staff, who are not research
 and development related and therefore not covered by grants, in the latter half of 2023. 

Professional
 Fees: The increase in professional fees compared to previous periods was due to higher legal, tax, audit, and consulting costs associated
 with completing year-end financial audits and preparing for the initial public offering. 

Information
 Technology Costs: The increase in information technology costs are due to the increase of personnel and hardware and software needs
 to support new personnel. 

Other
 General and Administrative Costs: There was a slight decrease in other general and administrative costs due to cost savings measures. 

Research
and Development Costs . The research and development costs were derived from the Company s technology development segment.
For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, there was an increase in research and development costs
that was due to a decrease of grant funding. It is important to note that the downswing in grant funding was not linked to any specific
event and is expected to fluctuate throughout the year. 

Other
Income . For the three and nine-month periods ended, September 30, 2024, is due to a rise in the interest expense
is related to inter-company loans and is eliminated for consolidation purposes.

Financial
Condition: Overall, the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to the transfer of T-Bills to cash, and was offset
by cash utilization for operational activities during the period. The rise in cash segregated in compliance with regulations stemmed
from customer deposits. The decline in investment securities at amortized cost occurred because U.S. Treasury bills were sold and
moved to high-yield money-market accounts to provide liquidity for operating expenses. The decrease in investment securities at fair value was due to a decrease in the value of common stock and
warrants over the period. Clearing deposits increased due to the launch of the self-clearing operations. Prepaid expenses remained
stable compared to the previous period. There was a decrease in grants receivable, which was influenced by the timing of the
collection of grant funds from the previous period. The growth in deferred offering costs was associated with expenses related to
Invizyne s planned IPO. Finally, the reduction in the right-of-use asset was due to its normal utilization. 

The
increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by payments for audit and legal services related
to the IPO of Invizyne. The decrease in accrued expenses resulted from the settlement of bonus liabilities that were accrued in the fourth
quarter of 2023. Additionally, the rise in payables to customers and non-customers stemmed from increased activity in the self-clearing
operations of the broker-dealer. Deferred grant reimbursements remained consistent with the previous period. Finally, the reduction in
lease liability was due to its normal utilization. 

The
increase in equity was primarily due to the Company s IPO, which closed on September 20, 2023. This increase was partly offset
by net losses from previous periods. 

The
decrease in non-controlling interest resulted from the net loss experienced by Invizyne.

and Capital Resources September 30, 2024 and 2023

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had 19,553,039 of working capital, which is a decrease of 14,273,850 from the working capital of
 33,826,889 that the Company had at September 30, 2023. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the use of cash to fund
operations for the nine-months ended on September 30, 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 16,679,428 of
cash and 5,084,197 of short-term U.S. Treasury bills available to fund its operations. 

Operating
Activities . For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, there was an increase in the net loss compared to the prior
period due to expense of stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, there was an accretion of investments at amortized costs
(U.S. Treasury Bills) and the acquisition of investment securities. An increase in accounts payable, grants receivable for the
technology segment, clearing deposits, and payables to customer was due to the implementation of the self-clearing operations. There
was a decrease in the accrued expenses due to bonuses being paid in Q1 of 2024, and a decrease in payables to
non-customers. 

For
the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, use of cash in operating activities represented a combination of increased
activity in Invizyne, increased professional and consulting fees related to year end audits and an increase in tax preparation fees
related to the publicly traded partnership. 

41 

Investing
Activities . For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, investing activities consisted of the proceeds
from the sale and the maturing of U.S. Treasury Bills and purchases of investment securities, which was offset by the reinvestment of
the proceeds into new U.S. Treasury Bills and the transfer of cash for operating activities and investments in money market funds. 

Financing
Activities . For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities consisted of deferred
costs related to the IPO of Invizyne. 

For
the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 financing activities consisted of costs related to MDB Capital
Holdings initial public offering incurred during the period. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 2 in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the discussion on recently accounting pronouncements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with general accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
We have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments
about matters that are uncertain. We believe that the judgment, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances
at the time. However, actual results could differ, and the use of other assumptions or estimates could result in material differences
in our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates are: 

Revenue
recognition Investment Banking and Warrants Valuation 

The
Company receives income from investment banking fees earned as an underwriter. As an underwriter, the Company helps clients raise capital via the sale
of various types of equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments
and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client s transaction. The Company generally does not incur costs
to obtain contracts with customers that are eligible for deferral or receive fees prior to recognizing revenue related to investment
banking transactions. If the Company did have any contract assets or liabilities related to these revenues it would be recorded on the
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Revenue
recognition may involve the bundling of investment banking services with other financial instruments. In such cases, we estimate the
fair value of the services provided and allocate the revenue accordingly. This estimation process involves significant judgment and sensitivity
to market conditions. Additionally, our investment banking activities may include the compensation for our services in warrants granted
to us. The valuation of these warrants requires significant estimates, including the use of option pricing models like the Black-Scholes
model. The key assumptions in this valuation process include the stock price on the date of valuation, the exercise price of the warrant,
the term to expiry, risk-free interest rate, and the expected volatility of the underlying stock. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: 

Level
1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 

Level
2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level
3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made
by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. 

42 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether the inputs
are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The
fair value of U.S. Treasury Bills and public equity securities are based on quoted market prices and are classified as level 1 of the
fair value hierarchy. The fair value of public equity securities that are not actively traded is based on quoted market prices of similar
instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and are classified as level 2 of the
fair value hierarchy. The fair value of warrants is based on a Black-Scholes model, which considers the stock price at the date of the
valuation, the warrant strike price, the term to expiry, the risk-free rate of return, and the expected volatility of the underlying
stock. The level in the fair value hierarchy for warrants depends primarily on whether the stock price is determinable from active trades,
and whether the expected volatility of the underlying stock is observable and are either classified as level 2 or level 3. The fair value
of non-public equity securities and simple agreements for future equity is based on the initial investment, less impairment, and they
are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. For the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in level 3 fair value
measurements, see Fair Value of Financial Instruments section of Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 

Accounting
for Research Grants 

Invizyne
receives grant reimbursements, which are netted against research and development expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of operations. Grant reimbursements for capitalized assets are recognized over the useful life of the assets, with the unrecognized portion
considered a deferred liability and are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet. 

Grants
that operate on a reimbursement basis are recognized on the accrual basis are revenues to extent of disbursements and commitments that
are allowable for reimbursement of allowable expenses incurred as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and expected to be received from funding
sources in the subsequent year. Management considers such receivables at September 30, 2024 and 2023, to be fully collectable, due to
the historical experience with the Federal Government of the United States of America. Accordingly, no allowance for grants receivable
was recorded in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Research
grants received from organizations are subject to the contract agreement as to how Invizyne conducts its research activities, and Invizyne
is required to comply with the agreement terms relating to those grants. Amounts received under research grants are nonrefundable, regardless
of the success of the underlying research project, to the extent that such amounts are expended in accordance with the approved grant
project. Invizyne is permitted to draw down (a process of submitting expenses for reimbursement) the research grants after incurring
the related expenses. Amounts received under research grants are offset against the related research and development costs in the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

Summary
of Business Activities and Plans 

On
September 20, 2023, the Company completed an initial public offering (IPO), which consisted of the sale of 1,666,666 shares of Class
A common shares at 12.00 per share, for gross proceeds of 19,999,992 that will be used for the development of Invizyne, identifying
and developing new partner companies, and general corporate and working capital requirements. 

On
June 15, 2022, the Company completed the first closing of a private placement, consisting of total gross proceeds of 25,289,660 from
the sale of 2,528,966 shares of Class A common shares, which have been and will continue to be used to support Invizyne into their IPO,
identifying and developing new partner companies, and general corporate and working capital requirements. 

43 

External
Risks Associated with the Company s Business Activities 

Inflation
Risk . The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its operations to date, other than its impact
on the general economy. 

Supply
Chain Issues . The Company does not currently expect that supply chain issues will have a significant impact on its business
activities. 

Potential
Recession . There are various indications that the United States economy may be entering a recessionary period. Although unclear
at this time an economic recession would likely impact the general business environment and the capital markets, which could, in turn,
if there is a recession, such an event could affect the Company. 

The
Company is continuing to monitor these matters and will adjust its current business and financing plans as more information and guidance
become available. 

Technology.
 Our partner companies endeavors to create and bring new technologies to the market may never come to fruition or might
not reach a level of development sufficient for commercial viability. Even if they do achieve a commercial level of development, the
acceptance of these technologies within the marketplace is uncertain. There s a possibility that the technologies they develop
may not gain widespread or timely acceptance, leading to the necessity for further funding to support the partner companies, or potentially
even prompting the difficult choice of discontinuing the business at a financial loss. Moreover, technologies from our partner companies
that undergo regulatory scrutiny, testing, and approval may ultimately fail to receive the necessary approvals from relevant regulatory
bodies. 

Principal
Commitments 

Net
Capital Requirement (Public Ventures) 

Public
Ventures is subject to the uniform net capital rule (SEC Rule 15c3-1) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ),
which requires both the maintenance of minimum net capital and the maintenance of maximum ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital.
At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Public Ventures had net capital of 11,765,823 and 6,037,743, respectively, which was 11,515,823 and
 5,787,743 in excess of the minimum 250,000, as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company s ratio of aggregate indebtedness of 7,034,937 to net capital was 0.60 to 1, as compared to the
maximum of a 15 to 1 allowable ratio of a broker dealer. Minimum net capital is based upon the greater of the statutory minimum net capital
of 250,000 or 2 of customer debits, which was calculated as 0 at September 30, 2024. 

The
requirement to comply with the Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 may limit Public Ventures ability to issue dividends to its parent
company. 

Indemnification
Provisions 

Public
Ventures has agreed to indemnify its clearing broker for losses that the clearing broker may sustain from the accounts of customers.
Should a customer not fulfill its obligation on a transaction, Public Ventures may be required to buy or sell securities at prevailing
market prices in the future on behalf of its customer. The indemnification obligations of Public Ventures to its clearing broker have
no maximum amount. All unsettled trades at September 30, 2024 and 2023 have subsequently settled with no resulting material liability
to Public Ventures. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Public Ventures had no material loss due to counterparty failure
and had no obligations outstanding under the indemnification arrangement as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

44 

Trends,
Events and Uncertainties 

Other
than as discussed above, we are not currently aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect
on our financial condition in the near term, although it is possible that new trends or events may develop in the future that could have
a material effect on our financial condition. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, and
as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the
reasonable assurance level. In light of this fact, the Company has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other
post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in the internal control over financial
reporting, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 

Ongoing
Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness 

The
Company is implementing measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the previously disclosed material weakness
are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. These remediation actions are ongoing,
and they include our expansion of our controls or control designs based on updated enhanced risk assessments. We have redesigned the
financial reporting process, to remediate the previously identified material weakness. We expect these changes to materially improve
our internal controls. 

The
weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has
concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the material weakness remediation efforts underway, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting identified
in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the nine-months ended
September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial
reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation that would
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition should such litigation be resolved
unfavorably. We believe that from time to time we will have commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of our business. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In
addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should also carefully review and consider the risk factors contained in
our other registration statements, reports and periodic filings with the SEC that could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors we have identified and discussed, however, do not identify all risks
that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not known to us or that we currently
consider to be immaterial to our operations.
