 shares (in addition to any shares that remained available for awards under the Equity Plan as of the Effective Date and any shares subject to outstanding awards granted under the Equity Plan as of the Effective Date). As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of common stock available for future issuance under the LTIP. 
 Pursuant to terms of the LTIP, we have issued to eligible participants RSUs, PSAs and SOSARs. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Awards In the first nine months of 2024, we granted RSUs to employees under our LTIP. The RSUs awarded in 2024 vest over , with vesting on December 31, 2024, on February 28, 2026, and vesting on February 28, 2027. PSAs were not awarded in 2024. Instead, there was a cash restoration award (paid in cash instead of stock) that vests the same as the RSUs. This cash restoration award is outside of the LTIP. In 2023, we granted RSUs and PSAs to employees under our LTIP. In 2023, of fair value of the awards granted were RSUs, which vest based on the passage of time, generally over a graded period or, in certain instances, the RSUs were cliff vesting after one or . The remaining of the fair value of the awards granted in 2023 were PSAs. The PSAs awarded vest based on either the achievement of cumulative financial performance targets covering a period or based on the total shareholder return relative to a broad market index. The performance measures include a minimum, target and maximum performance level providing the grantees an opportunity to receive more or less shares than targeted depending on actual financial performance. 
 For RSUs, the grant date fair value of the awards, or the closing price per common share on the date of the award, is used to determine the amount of expense to be recognized over the applicable service period. For PSAs, the grant date fair value is estimated using a lattice model. The significant inputs include the stock price, volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free rate of return. Settlement of RSUs and PSAs will be made in shares of our common stock currently held in treasury.

 million and income tax expense of million. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was unfavorably impacted by the jurisdictional mix of pretax results among the Company and its subsidiaries and losses which generated no tax benefit in domestic and certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of million for U.S. federal and certain foreign jurisdictions against our net deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. Based on this analysis, we

million and million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2024, if such benefits were to be recognized, approximately million would be recorded as a component of income tax expense, thereby affecting our effective tax rate. 
 The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for uncertain tax positions. Based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved or as statutes are closed. Due to potential resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the lapse of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible our gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months by a range of to million. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.

 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining a global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15 . The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. Effective January 1, 2024, a number of countries have proposed or enacted legislation to implement core elements of the Pillar Two proposal. Pillar Two did not have a significant impact on Glatfelter's financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. While Glatfelter is monitoring developments and evaluating the potential impact on future periods, Glatfelter does not expect Pillar Two to have a significant impact on its 2024 financial results.

 On September 2, 2021, we entered into a restatement agreement as part of a Fourth Amended and Restated million Revolving Credit Facility and a million Term Loan (collectively, the Credit Agreement ). 
 On May 9, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which was further amended on March 30, 2023. The March 30, 2023 amendment to the Credit Agreement reduced the Revolving Credit Facility to million and had us fully extinguish the million Term Loan. All remaining principal outstanding and accrued interest under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and payable on September 2, 2026. 
 The Credit Agreement contains a number of customary covenants for financings of this type that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of or create liens on assets, incur additional indebtedness, limits certain intercompany financing arrangements, make acquisitions and engage in mergers or consolidations. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants requiring a minimum debt coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the definition in our Credit Agreement, was x. A breach of these requirements would give rise to certain remedies under the Revolving Credit Facility, among which is the termination of the agreement. 
 On March 30, 2023, we entered into a million Term Loan with certain affiliates of Angelo, Gordon Co., L.P. AG Loan ). The net proceeds from the AG Loan were used to extinguish the million Term Loan, to repay a portion of outstanding revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, for working capital and general corporate purposes and to pay estimated fees and expenses. The AG Loan will mature on March 23, 2029 and is prepayable, in whole or in part, at any time at the prepayable premium specified in the Term Loan Agreement. 
 On October 25, 2021, we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2029 (the Notes ). The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to pay the purchase price of the Jacob Holm acquisition, to repay certain indebtedness of Jacob Holm, to repay outstanding revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and to pay estimated fees and expenses. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2029. The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture. Prior to November 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a "make-whole" premium as specified in the Indenture. 
 Glatfelter Gernsbach GmbH Gernsbach ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a series of borrowing agreements with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, D sseldorf IKB ). Each of the borrowings require quarterly repayments of principal and interest and provide for representations, warranties and covenants customary for financings of these types. The financial covenants of these borrowings are calculated by reference to the Credit Agreement. These borrowings were fully extinguished on March 14, 2023. 
 In 2021, Gernsbach also entered into fixed-rate non-amortizing term loans with certain financial institutions. On February 28, 2023, of these term loans for million was fully extinguished. The remaining term loan matured in March 2024. 
 Aggregated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs incurred in connection with all of our outstanding debt totaled million at September 30, 2024. The deferred costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the underlying instruments. Amortization expense related to deferred debt issuance costs totaled million and million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Glatfelter Corporation guarantees all debt obligations of its subsidiaries. All such obligations are recorded in these consolidated financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of letters of credit issued to us by certain financial institutions. The letters of credit, which reduce amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility, provide financial assurances for the performance of long-term monitoring activities associated with the Fox River environmental matter and for the benefit of certain state workers compensation insurance agencies in conjunction with our self-insurance program. We bear the credit risk on this amount to the extent that we do not comply with the provisions of certain agreements. amounts are outstanding under the letters of credit.

 We designate certain currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted raw material purchases, certain production costs or capital expenditures with exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. With respect to hedges of forecasted raw material purchases or production costs, the amount deferred is subsequently reclassified into costs of products sold in the period that inventory produced using the hedged transaction affects earnings. For hedged capital expenditures, deferred gains or losses are reclassified and included in the historical cost of the capital asset and subsequently affect earnings as depreciation is recognized.

During the first nine months of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax loss of million on the remeasurement of the term loan from changes in currency exchange rates. Such amounts are recorded as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments - Foreign Currency Hedges We also entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact changes in currency exchange rates have on balance sheet monetary assets and liabilities. None of these contracts are designated as hedges for financial accounting purposes and, accordingly, changes in value of the foreign exchange forward contracts and in the offsetting underlying on-balance-sheet transactions are reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption Other, net.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 Not designated as hedging: Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
 
 The amounts set forth in the table above represent the net asset or liability giving effect to rights of offset with each counterparty. The effect of netting the amounts presented above did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position. 
 
 The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts are considered to be Level 2. Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using foreign currency forward and interest rate curves. The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the contract rate to the forward rate and discounting to present value. Contracts in a gain position are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets under the caption Prepaid expenses and other current assets and the value of contracts in a loss position is recorded under the caption Other current liabilities.) ) ) ) Not designated as hedging: Forward foreign currency exchange contracts: Other net )

 Credit risk related to derivative activity arises in the event the counterparty fails to meet its obligations to us. This exposure is generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty s obligations exceed our obligation to them. Our policy is to enter into contracts only with financial institutions which meet certain minimum credit ratings.

Our obligation under this agreement is included in our total reserve for the Site. We are obligated to make the regular payments under that fixed-price contract until the remaining amount due is less than the OU1 escrow account balance. We are permitted to pay for this contract using the remaining balance of the escrow account established by us and WTM I Company WTM I another PRP, under the OU1 consent decree during any period that the balance in the escrow account exceeds the amount due under our fixed-price contract. As of September 30, 2024, the balance in the escrow exceeds the amounts due under the fixed-price contract by approximately million. At September 30, 2024, the escrow account balance totaled million which is included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet under the caption Other assets. 
 Under the consent decree, we are responsible for reimbursement of government oversight costs paid from October 2018 and later over approximately the next years. We anticipate that oversight costs will decline as activities at the site have transitioned from remediation to long-term monitoring and maintenance.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein and Glatfelter s Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2023 Form 10-K"). 

Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future consolidated financial position or results of operations, made in this Report on Form 10-Q are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates , believes , expects , future , intends and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from such expectations. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements all of which are inherently difficult to predict. Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations. Accordingly, we identify the following important factors, among others, which could cause our results to differ from any results that might be projected, forecasted or estimated in any such forward-looking statements: 
 i. risks related to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions and its impact on our production, sales, supply chain, cost of energy, and availability of energy due to natural gas supply issues into Europe; 
 ii. disruptions of our global supply chain, including the availability of key raw materials and transportation for the delivery of critical inputs and of products to customers, and the increase in the costs of transporting materials and products; 
 iii. risks associated with our ability to increase selling prices quickly or sufficiently enough to recover rapid cost inflation in our raw materials, energy, freight and other costs, and the potential reduction or loss of sales due to price increases; 
 iv. variations in demand for our products, including the impact of unplanned market-related downtime, variations in product pricing, or product substitution; 
 v. the impact of competition, changes in industry production capacity, including the construction of new facilities or new machines, the closing of facilities and incremental changes due to capital expenditures or productivity increases; 
 vi. risks associated with our international operations, including local economic and political environments and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 
 vii. our ability to develop new, high value-added products; 
 viii. changes in the price or availability of raw materials we use, particularly woodpulp, pulp substitutes, synthetic pulp, other specialty fibers and abaca fiber; 
 ix. changes in energy-related prices and commodity raw materials with an energy component; 
 x. the impact of unplanned production interruption at our facilities or at any of our key suppliers; 
 xi. disruptions in production and/or increased costs due to labor disputes; 
 xii. the gain or loss of significant customers and/or on-going viability of such customers; 
 xiii. the impact of war and terrorism; 
 xiv. the impact of unfavorable outcomes of audits by various state, federal or international tax authorities or changes in pre-tax income and its impact on the valuation of deferred taxes; and 
 xv. enactment of adverse state, federal or foreign tax or other legislation or changes in government legislation, policy or regulation. 

Introduction We manufacture a wide array of engineered materials and manage our company along three operating segments: 
 Airlaid Materials with sales of airlaid nonwoven fabric-like materials used in feminine hygiene products, adult incontinence products, tabletop, specialty wipes, home care products and other airlaid applications; 
 Composite Fibers with sales of single-serve tea and coffee filtration papers, wallcovering base materials, composite laminate papers, technical specialties including substrates for electrical applications, and metallized products; and 
 Spunlace with sales of premium quality spunlace nonwovens for critical cleaning, high-performance materials, personal care, hygiene and medical applications. 
 - 26 - 

The former Specialty Papers business results of operations and financial condition are reported as discontinued operations. Following is a discussion and analysis primarily of the financial results of operations and financial condition of our continuing operations. 
 As previously announced on February 7, 2024, we entered into certain definitive agreements with Berry Global Group, Inc. Berry for Berry to spin-off and merge the majority of its Health, Hygiene and Specialties segment including its Global Nonwovens and Films business HHNF with Glatfelter (the Merger ). The board of directors of both Berry and Glatfelter have unanimously approved the Merger. The Merger is expected to occur through a series of transactions, including a Reverse Morris Trust transaction such that HHNF will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Glatfelter. Upon completion of the Merger, Berry shareholders will hold 90 of the outstanding shares of Glatfelter and Glatfelter shareholders will continue to hold 10 of the outstanding shares of Glatfelter. The combined company s Board of Directors will include 6 members chosen by Berry and 3 chosen from Glatfelter s existing Board of Directors, with Curt Begle, the current president of the Health, Hygiene Specialties Division of Berry, becoming the Chief Executive Officer. 
 Previously, the Company reported the achievement of all required approvals and clearances under competition and foreign direct investment laws and Berry received a favorable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service regarding the qualification of the spin-off and the merger as tax-free transactions under the Internal Revenue Code. On October 23, 2024 we obtained the shareholder approval for the merger and the transaction is expected to close on November 4, 2024. Prior to the completion of the Merger, Glatfelter and HHNF will continue to operate as independent companies. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Overview For the first nine months of 2024, we reported a loss from continuing operations of 61.9 million, sor 1.37 per share compared with a loss of 69.5 million or 1.54 per share in the same period in 2023. The following table sets forth summarized consolidated results of operations: 
 Nine months ended September 30, In thousands, except per share 2024 2023 Net sales 988,800 1,065,134 Gross profit 106,778 98,834 Operating income (loss) 8,720 (1,719) Continuing operations Loss (61,947) (69,493) Loss per share (1.37) (1.54) Net loss (57,873) (70,387) Loss per share (1.28) (1.56) 
 The reported results are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP and reflect the impact of a number of significant items including strategic initiatives, turnaround strategy costs, debt refinancing, and CEO transition costs, among others. Our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect: i) the impact of macroeconomic conditions and new sanctions related to wallcover resulting in lower sales volumes, as well as, lower production; ii) higher interest expense stemming from the debt refinancing in the first nine months of 2023; iii) costs incurred related to the merger with Berry s HHNF business. 
 In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our performance using financial metrics not calculated in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation Adjusted EBITDA ). On an adjusted earnings basis, a non-GAAP measure, we had an adjusted loss from continuing operations of 38.0 million, or 0.84 per share for the first nine months of 2024, compared with a loss of 36.7 million, or 0.81 per share, a year ago. Our Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP measure, was 74.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 67.5 million for the same period in 2023. We disclose this information to allow investors to evaluate our performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and we believe it is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation. 
 - 27 - 

Adjusted earnings consists of net income determined in accordance with GAAP adjusted to exclude the impact of the following: 
 Strategic initiatives. These adjustments primarily reflect professional and legal fees and other costs incurred which are directly related to evaluating and executing certain strategic initiatives including costs associated with the Berry HHNF merger. 
 Turnaround Strategy costs. This adjustment reflects costs incurred in connection with the Company's Turnaround Strategy initiated in 2022 under its new chief executive officer to drive operational and financial improvement. These costs are primarily related to professional services fees and employee separation costs. 
 Ober-Schmitten divestiture. These adjustments reflect employee separation costs and professional and other costs directly associated with the divestiture of the Ober-Schmitten, Germany facility. 
 Debt refinancing costs. Represents charges to write-off unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the extinguishment of the Company s 220.0 million Term Loan and IKB loans, as well as the amendment to the Company's credit facility. These costs also include an early repayment penalty related to the extinguishment of the IKB loans. 
 CEO transition costs. This adjustment reflects costs associated with the separation of our former CEO, including a non-cash pension settlement charge related to a lump-sum distribution made in Q1 2023 under the terms of his non-qualified pension plan agreement. 
 COVID-19 ERC recovery. This adjustment reflects the benefit recognized from employee retention credits claimed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act and the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 and professional services fees directly associated with claiming this benefit. 
 Timberland sales and related costs. These adjustments exclude gains from the sales of timberlands as these items are not considered to be part of our core business, ongoing results of operations or cash flows. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may benefit our operating results. 
 These adjustments are each unique and not considered to be on-going in nature. The transactions are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact our operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of our past or future performance and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes. 
 Adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as

a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted earnings for the periods presented:

 (5) Reflects 1.8 million write-off of deferred debt issuance costs in connection with the Company s debt refinancing in Q1 2023, and 0.1 million in early repayment penalties and write-off of unamortized financing fees on the IKB loans. 
 (6) Reflects pension settlement charge related to former CEO's separation. 
 (7) Reflects 0.3 million of interest income on employee retention credits claimed under the CARES Act of 2020 and the subsequent related amendments, offset by professional fees of less than 0.1 million. 
 (8) Tax effect on adjustments calculated based on the incremental effective tax rate of the jurisdiction in which each adjustment originated. For items originating in the U.S., no tax effect is recognized due to the previously established valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets. 
 (9) Tax effect of applying certain provisions of the CARES Act of 2020. The amount in 2023 also includes 2.4 million of deferred tax expense resulting from valuation allowance for Ober-Schmitten facility.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: 
 Adjusted EBITDA Nine months ended September 30, In thousands 2024 2023 Net loss (57,873) (70,387) Exclude: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (4,074) 894 Add back: Taxes on continuing operations 9,597 13,421 Depreciation and amortization 47,125 47,394 Interest expense, net 53,218 46,082 EBITDA 47,993 37,404 Adjustments: Strategic initiatives 23,024 2,158 Turnaround strategy costs 449 7,566 Ober-Schmitten divestiture 18,797 Debt refinancing 59 CEO transition costs 579 Share-based compensation 2,550 2,205 COVID-19 ERC recovery 41 Timberland sales and related costs (1,305) Adjusted EBITDA 74,016 67,504 
 EBITDA is a measure used by management to assess our operating performance and is calculated using income (loss) from continuing operations and excludes interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated using EBITDA and further excludes certain items management considers to be unrelated to the company s core operations. The adjustments include, among others, strategic initiative costs, turnaround strategy costs, and share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that excludes costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.

 Segments Results of individual operating segments are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; therefore, the financial results of individual segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company.

 Management evaluates results of operations of the operating segments before certain corporate level costs and the effects of certain gains or losses not considered to be related to the core business operations. Management believes that this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core businesses, the profitability of the segments

and the extent of cash flow generated from these core operations. Such amounts are presented under the caption Other and Unallocated. In the evaluation of operating segments results, management does not use any measures of total assets. This presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company. It is also on this basis that the Company s performance is evaluated internally and by the Company s Board of Directors.

 The following table sets forth the contribution to consolidated net sales by each segment: 
 Nine months ended September 30, Percent of Total 2024 2023 Segment Airlaid Materials 40.5 43.1 Composite Fibers 35.0 34.4 Spunlace 24.5 22.5 Total 100.0 100.0 
 Net sales totaled 988.8 million and 1,065.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net sales for Airlaid Materials, Composite Fibers and Spunlace decreased by 12.8 , 5.6 and 1.1 , respectively, on a constant currency basis. 
 
 Airlaid Materials first nine months net sales decreased 58.5 million in the year-over-year comparison mainly driven by lower selling prices of 41.0 million from cost pass-through arrangements and lower energy surcharges in Europe as both raw materials and energy input costs declined compared to last year. Shipments were 3.3 lower driven by declines in the hygiene categories mainly due to pricing actions taken in 2023 to retain margins as well as lower shipments in the home care category. Currency translation was favorable by 0.6 million. 
 
 Airlaid Materials first nine months of operating income of 22.8 million was 12.0 million lower when compared to the first nine months of 2023. Selling price decreases of 41.0 million were mostly offset by lower raw material, energy, and other inflation costs of 38.5 million. For the first nine months of 2024, primary raw material input costs decreased by 36.6 million, or 15 , and energy costs decreased by 1.8 million, or 10 , compared to the same nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Airlaid Materials had approximately 76 of its net sales with contracts with pass-through provisions. Operations were unfavorable by 5.2 million mainly driven by lower production and higher wage inflation. The impact of currency and related hedging negatively impacted earnings by 1.1 million. The primary drivers of the change in Airlaid Materials operating income are summarized in the following chart (presented in millions): 
 
 - 32 - 

Composite Fibers net sales were 21.0 million lower in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 2023 due to lower selling prices of 20.9 million. Even though s hipments were higher 2.3 , it was largely driven by the composite laminates and metallized products categories that have lower average selling prices compared to other inclined wire products lowering the revenue for the nine months. Currency translation was favorable by 0.3 million. 
 
 Composite Fibers had an operating income for the first nine months of 20.6 million which was 6.3 million higher when compared to the first nine months of 2023. Selling price decreases of 20.9 million were fully offset by lower raw material, energy, and other inflation costs of 20.9 million. For the first nine months of 2024, primary raw material input costs decreased by 15.7 million, or 3 , and energy costs decreased by 5.2 million, or 10 , compared to the same nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Composite Fibers had approximately 45 of its net sales with contracts with pass-through provisions. Operations were favorable by 1.9 million mainly driven by higher inclined wire production when compared to the same period in 2023. The impact of currency and related hedging positively impacted earnings by 0.1 million. The primary drivers of the change in Composite Fibers operating income are summarized in the following chart (presented in millions): 
 
 Spunlace s net sales were 2.8 million higher in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, mainly driven by higher shipments of Sontara product categories that have higher average selling prices compared to health and hygiene products. This was partially offset by lower selling prices of 7.6 millio n mainly due to cost pass-through arrangements. Currency translation was slightly favorable by 0.1 million. 
 
 Spunlace had an operating income for the first nine months of 6.3 million which was 10.7 million higher when compared to the operating loss of 4.4 million of the first nine months of 2023. Selling price decreases of 7.6 million were more than offset by lower raw material, energy, and other inflation costs of 13.2 million. For the first nine months of 2024, primary raw material input costs decreased by 12.2 million, or 10 , and energy costs decreased by 0.9 million, or 
 - 33 - 

6 , compared to the same nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Spunlace had approximately 53 of its net sales with contracts with pass-through provisions. Operations were favorable by 4.3 million mainly driven by higher production, lower operational spending, and improved operations when compared to the same period in 2023. The impact of currency and related hedging negatively impacted earnings by 0.1 million. 
 In September 2024, our Asheville facility was impacted by Hurricane Helene. Fortunately, our facility avoided property damage, however, performance was impacted for four days in Q3. Due to lack of access to water, the facility remained idle through the month of October; however we anticipate operations and shipments will resume in early November. 
 
 The primary drivers of the change in Spunlace s operating income are summarized in the following chart (presented in millions): 
 
 Other and Unallocated The amount of operating expense not allocated to a reporting segment in the Segment Financial Information totaled 41.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 46.5 million in the same period a year ago. Excluding the items identified to present adjusted earnings, unallocated expenses for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 2.3 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 mainly driven by Ober-Schmitten divestiture costs incurred in 2023. 
 
 Income taxes In the first nine months of 2024, our U.S. GAAP pre-tax loss from continuing operations totaled 52.4 million and we recorded an income tax provision of 9.6 million, which primarily related to the tax provision for foreign jurisdictions, reserves for uncertain tax positions, and valu ation allowances for domestic and foreign jurisdiction losses for which no tax benefit could be recognized. The comparable amounts in the same first nine months of 2023 were a pre-tax loss of 56.1 million and an income tax provision of 13.4 million. 
 Foreign Currency We own and operate facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, and the Philippines. The functional currency of our Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. However, in Germany, France and Spain, it is the euro, in the UK, it is the British pound sterling, and in the Philippines the functional currency is the peso. On an annual basis, our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated 170 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average currency exchange rate was 1.09 dollar/euro compared with 1.08 in the same period of 2023. With respect to the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have differing amounts of inflows and outflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant. The translation of the results from international operations into U.S. dollars is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 The table below summarizes the translation impact on reported results that changes in currency exchange rates had on our non-U.S. based operations from the conversion of these operation s results for the first nine months of 2024.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Overview For the third quarter of 2024, we reported a loss from continuing operations of 20.0 million, or 0.44 per share compared with a loss of 19.7 million or 0.43 per share in the same period in 2023. The following table sets forth summarized consolidated results of operations: 
 Three months ended September 30, In thousands, except per share 2024 2023 Net sales 332,101 329,921 Gross profit 35,481 44,487 Operating income (loss) 2,971 2,653 Continuing operations Loss (20,002) (19,680) Loss per share (0.44) (0.43) Net loss (15,247) (19,863) Loss per share (0.33) (0.43) 
 The reported results are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP and reflect the impact of a number of significant items including strategic initiatives, turnaround strategy costs, and the loss on sale of our Ober-Schmitten operations, among others. Our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflect: i) the impact of macroeconomic conditions and new sanctions related to wallcover resulting in lower sales volumes, as well as, lower production, ii) higher interest expense stemming from the debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2023, iii) costs incurred related to our turnaround strategy, iv) costs associated with the pending merger with Berry s HHNF business. 
 In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our performance using financial metrics not calculated in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation Adjusted EBITDA ). On an adjusted earnings basis, a non-GAAP measure, we had an adjusted loss from continuing operations of 11.8 million, or 0.26 per share for the third quarter of 2024, compared with a loss of 10.4 million, or 0.23 per share, a year ago. Our Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP measure, was 24.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25.5 million for the same period in 2023. We disclose this information to allow investors to evaluate our performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and we believe it is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation. 
 Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following table sets forth the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted loss from continuing operations for the periods indicated:

be unrelated to the company s core operations. The adjustments include, among others, Ober-Schmitten divestiture costs, turnaround strategy costs, strategic initiative costs, and share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that excludes costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.

 Segments Results of individual operating segments are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; therefore, the financial results of individual segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. The management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the segments. Methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change. The costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the segment are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services or are included in Other and Unallocated in the table set forth above.

Management evaluates results of operations of the operating segments before certain corporate level costs and the effects of certain gains or losses not considered to be related to the core business operations. Management believes that this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core businesses, the profitability of the segments and the extent of cash flow generated from these core operations. Such amounts are presented under the caption Other and Unallocated. In the evaluation of operating segments results, management does not use any measures of total assets. This presentation is aligned with the management and operating structure of our company. It is also on this basis that the Company s performance is evaluated internally and by the Company s Board of Directors.

 Net sales totaled 332.1 million and 329.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net sales decreased for Airlaid Materials by 5.9 and increased for Composite Fibers and Spunlace by 3.6 and 8.7 , respectively, on a constant currency basis. 
 
 Airlaid Materials third quarter net sales decreased 8.7 million in the year-over-year comparison mainly driven by lower selling prices from cost pass-through arrangements as raw materials input costs declined compared to last year. Shipments were 2.5 lower driven by declines in the hygiene categories mainly due to pricing actions taken in 2023 to retain margins. Currency translation was favorable by 0.6 million. 
 
 Airlaid Materials 2024 third quarter operating income of 10.3 million was 0.9 million lower than the third quarter operating income in 2023. Lower shipments in the hygiene categories due to pricing actions taken in 2023 to retain margins and lower shipments in the home care category related to timing lowered earnings by 0.7 million. Selling price decreases and lower energy surcharges of 7.8 million were moderately offset by lower raw material, energy, and other inflationary costs of 6.4 million. For the third quarter of 2024, primary raw material input costs decreased by 6.5 million, or 9 , and energy costs increased by 0.2 million, or 3 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Airlaid Materials had approximately 75 of its net sales with contracts with pass-through provisions. Operations and other costs were favorable by 0.7 million mainly driven by lower production. The impact of currency and related hedging positively impacted earnings by 0.5 million. The primary drivers of the change in Airlaid Materials operating income are summarized in the following chart (presented in millions): 
 
 - 38 - 

Composite Fibers net sales were 4.0 million lower in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the year-ago quarter. S hipments were higher 3.0 largely driven by the composite laminates, food and beverage and metallized categories but were partially offset by lower wallcover shipments as a result of additional sanctions impacting sales to our Eastern European customers. Currency translation was favorable by 0.7 million. 
 
 Composite Fibers' 2024 third quarter operating income of 6.3 million was 1.0 million lower than the third quarter operating income in 2023. Lower selling prices and energy surcharges were unfavorable by 2.4 million and increases in input prices paid for raw materials, energy, freight, and packaging were unfavorable by 1.1 million, slightly offset by higher shipments of 1.7 million. For the third quarter of 2024, primary raw material input costs increased slightly by 1.9 million, or 1 , while energy costs decreased by 0.9 million, or 6 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Composite Fibers had approximately 45 of its net sales with contracts with pass-through provisions. Operations and other costs were favorable by 0.6 million mainly driven by higher inclined wire production. The impact of currency and related hedging positively impacted earnings by 0.2 million. The primary drivers of the change in Composite Fibers operating income are summarized in the following chart (presented in millions): 
 
 Spunlace s net sales were 6.7 million higher in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the year-ago quarter mainly driven by higher Sontara sales that has higher average selling price compared to the hygiene and wipes categories. Currency translation was slightly favorable by 0.2 million. 
 
 Spunlace's 2024 third quarter operating income of 1.3 million was 2.4 million higher compared to the operating loss of 1.1 million in third quarter of 2023. Lower selling prices and energy surcharges were unfavorable by 1.1 million but were more than fully offset by lower raw material and energy costs of 1.7 million. For the third quarter of 2024, primary raw material input costs decreased by 1.4 million, or 4 , and energy costs decreased by 0.2 million, or 5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Spunlace had approximately 53 of its net sales with contracts with 
 - 39 - 

pass-through provisions. Operations and others were favorable by 0.9 million driven by higher production to meet customer demand. The impact of currency and related hedging positively impacted earnings by 0.1 million. 
 In September 2024, our Asheville facility was impacted by Hurricane Helene. Fortunately, our facility avoided property damage, however, performance was impacted for four days in Q3. Due to lack of access to water, the facility remained idle through the month of October; however we anticipate operations and shipments will resume in early November. 
 The primary drivers of the change in Spunlace s operating income are summarized in the following chart (presented in millions): 
 
 Other and Unallocated The amount of net operating expenses not allocated to an operating segment, and reported as Other and Unallocated in our table of Segment Financial Performance, totaled 15.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 14.8 million in the same period a year ago. Excluding the items identified to present adjusted earnings, unallocated expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Income taxes In the third quarter of 2024, our U.S. GAAP pre-tax loss from continuing operations totaled 18.5 million and we recorded an income tax expense of 1.5 million which primarily related to the tax provision for foreign jurisdictions, reserves for uncertain tax positions, and valu ation allowances for domestic and foreign jurisdiction losses for which no tax benefit could be recognized. The comparable amounts in the same quarter of 2023 were a pre-tax loss of 16.4 million and an income tax provision of 3.3 million. 
 Foreign Currency We own and operate facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, and the Philippines. The functional currency of our Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. However, in Germany, France and Spain, it is the euro, in the UK, it is the British pound sterling, and in the Philippines the functional currency is the peso. On an annual basis, our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated 170 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average currency exchange rate was 1.09 dollar/euro compared with 1.09 in the same period of 2023. With respect to the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have differing amounts of inflows and outflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant. The translation of the results from international operations into U.S. dollars is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 The table below summarizes the translation impact on reported results that changes in currency exchange rates had on our non-U.S. based operations from the conversion of these operation s results for the third quarter of 2024.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our business requires significant expenditures for new or enhanced equipment, to support our research and development efforts, and to support our business strategy. In addition, we have mandatory debt service requirements of both principal and interest. The following table summarizes cash flow information for each of the periods presented: 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, In thousands 2024 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of period 55,360 119,162 Cash provided (used) by Operating activities (8,397) (41,955) Investing activities (20,782) (28,694) Financing activities 17,770 10,987 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 192 (143) Change in cash and cash equivalents from discontinued operations (234) (734) Net cash used (11,451) (60,539) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of period 43,909 58,623 Less: restricted cash in Prepaid and other current assets (2,274) (3,600) Less: restricted cash in Other assets (2,282) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of period 41,635 52,741 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 41.6 million in cash and cash equivalents cash held by both domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Approximately 99.2 of our cash and cash equivalents is held by our foreign subsidiaries but could be repatriated without incurring a significant amount of additional taxes. 
 Cash used by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 totaled 8.4 million compared with 42.0 million in the same period a year ago . The decrease in cash used was primarily due to an improvement in working capital usage of approximately 22.1 million, partially offset by an increase in interest paid of 7.5 million due to the higher interest rates on our debt stemming from the debt refinancing in the first nine months of 2023 and higher professional costs associated with the pending merger. Operating cash also improved 5.8 million primarily due to a lump-sum payment in Q1 2023 to our former CEO under the terms of his non-qualified pension plan. 
 Net cash used by investing activities was 20.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 28.7 million in the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures totaled 21.7 million and 25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to total between 30 million and 35 million in 2024. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 17.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 11.0 million in the same period of 2023. The change in financing activities primarily reflects additional borrowings under our 
 - 41 - 

existing revolving credit facility. In 2023, we entered into a 250.0 million Term Loan in which the proceeds were used to fully extinguish the 220.0 million Term Loan, the IKB term loans and reduced the revolving credit facility balance. 
 As discussed in Item 1 - Financial Information, Note - 15, our Credit Agreement and AG Loan contains a number of customary compliance covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the definition in our Credit Agreement and AG Loan, was 3.8x, well within the maximum limit. A breach of these requirements would give rise to certain remedies under the Credit Agreement and AG Loan, among which are the termination, and accelerated repayment of the outstanding borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest. As discussed in Note 15 - Long Term Debt, on March 30, 2023, we amended our Credit Agreement to permit the maximum leverage ratio (calculated as consolidated senior secured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA) to be 4.25 to 1.0 through the quarter ended December 31, 2024, stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 at June 30, 2025, and 3.50 to 1.0 at June 30, 2026. 
 Details of our outstanding long-term indebtedness are set forth under Item 1 - Financial Statements Note 15 - Long-Term Debt . " 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment, as well as human health and safety. At various times, we have incurred significant costs to comply with these regulations and we could incur additional costs as new regulations are developed or regulatory priorities change. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had ample liquidity consisting of 41.6 million of cash on hand and 45.6 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility. We expect to meet all of our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, our existing credit facility and other long-term debt. 
 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not entered into any off-balance-sheet arrangements. Financial derivative instruments, to which we are a party, and guarantees of indebtedness, which solely consist of obligations of subsidiaries, are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets included herein in Item 1 Financial Statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 Year Ended December 31 September 30, 2024 In thousands, except percentages 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt Average principal outstanding At variable interest rates 120,020 120,020 80,890 120,020 120,020 At fixed interest rates 774,302 774,302 774,302 774,302 774,302 775,339 738,386 895,359 858,406 Weighted-average interest rate On variable rate debt 8.52 8.52 8.52 On fixed rate debt 7.05 7.05 7.05 7.05 7.05 
 Our market risk exposure primarily results from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The table above presents the average principal outstanding and related interest rates for the next five years for debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Fair values included herein have been determined based upon rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 895.4 million of long-term debt, of which 120.0 million, or 13.4 , was at variable interest rates. Variable-rate debt represents borrowings under our credit agreement. The fixed-rate Term Loans are euro-based borrowings and thus the value of which is also subject to currency risk. Variable-rate debt outstanding represents borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and a euro-denominated term loan which accrue interest based on one-month LIBOR plus a margin. 
 At September 30, 2024, the weighted-average interest rate paid was equal to 8.52 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on variable rate debt would increase annual interest expense by 1.2 million. In the event rates are 100 basis points lower, interest expense would be 1.2 million lower. 
 As part of our overall risk management practices, we enter into financial derivatives primarily designed to either i) hedge currency risks associated with forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or ii) mitigate the impact that changes in currency exchange rates have on intercompany financing transactions and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables foreign currency hedges. For a more complete discussion of this activity, refer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 - Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 
 We are subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. On an annual basis, our euro denominated net sales is estimated to exceed euro expenses by approximately 170 million. With respect to the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree. As a result, particularly with respect to the euro, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preceding discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, environmental liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that our policies for long- and indefinite-lived assets, environmental liabilities and income taxes represent the most significant and subjective estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are therefore considered our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our critical accounting policies or estimates. See Note 2 Accounting Policies, of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC, for additional information regarding our critical accounting policies. 
 - 43 - 

Long- and indefinite-lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of our long- and indefinite-lived assets, including plant, equipment, timberlands, goodwill, and other intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. 
 
 The fair value of our reporting units, which are also our operating segments, is determined using a market approach and a discounted cash flow model. Our evaluations include a variety of qualitative factors and analyses based on estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the underlying assets, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the value of an asset determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset. At September 30, 2024, Airlaid Materials was our only operating segment with goodwill. Our Airlaid Materials segment s fair value exceeded its carrying value at the time of its last valuation performed in connection with the last annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2023 by approximately 19 . Airlaid Material s fair value, as well as the asset groups within each of our operating segments, could be impacted by factors such as unexpected changes in market demand for our products, the impact of competition, and the inability to successfully adjust selling prices in response to changes in inflation, among other factors. Future adverse changes such as these or in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and our principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that, as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Controls There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
