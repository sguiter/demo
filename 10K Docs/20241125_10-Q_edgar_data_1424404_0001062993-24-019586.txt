 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors", that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report, particularly in the section entitled "Risk Factors". In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. All references to "CDN " refer to Canadian dollars and all references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock. As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our", the "Company" and "Wolverine" mean Wolverine Technologies Corp., unless otherwise indicated. Corporate History Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2006 and is quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol WOLV. Since we began operations in 2006, the Company has been focused primarily on the exploration for and development of base and precious metal properties located in North America. The Company has two mineral properties located in Labrador, Canada, the Frog Property and the Cache River Property. On February 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement ("Agreement") with 86835 Newfoundland Labrador Corp. ("86835"), a non-arm's length party, to acquire a 40 interest in the Frog Property (the "Property") located in Labrador, Canada. Under the terms of the Agreement the Company issued 28,500,000 common shares at a deemed price of 0.04 per share for a purchase price of 1,140,000. The deemed issue price of the acquisition was determined based on an equivalent price per share for a concurrent financing. For accounting purposes, the acquisition had a fair value 2,850,000 and a fair value of 0.10 per share based upon the closing market price of Wolverine on February 28, 2022. 86835 is an Innu owned and operated private mineral exploration company which owns mineral properties in both Newfoundland and Labrador. Bruce Costerd and Luke Rich are officers, directors and shareholders of 86835 and Wolverine. On August 9, 2022, Wolverine entered into an Amended Purchase Agreement with 86835 Newfoundland Labrador Corp. ("86835") relating to the acquisition of a 40 interest in the Frog Property located in Labrador, Canada. Under the terms of the Amended Purchase Agreement the number of shares issued pursuant to the acquisition was reduced from 28,500,000 common shares to 27,500,000 common shares and the number of claims was reduced from 315 claims to 262 claims. 3 
 On July 19, 2023, Wolverine entered into a Second Amendment of the Purchase Agreement with Rich Resources Inc.("Rich") formerly 86835 Newfoundland Labrador Corp. relating to the acquisition of a 40 interest in the Frog Property located in Labrador, Canada. Under the terms of the Second Amendment of the Purchase Agreement 24,000,000 common shares of Wolverine were issued to Rich at a deemed price of 0.04 per share and 12,000,000 Wolverine common shares held by each of Bruce Costerd and Luke Rich were cancelled. The Company also holds a 90 interest in the Cache River Property located in Labrador, Canada consisting of a total of 53 mineral claims and an area of 1320 hectares (3,262 acres). The Company is not currently conducting any exploration on the Cache River Property. We have not yet determined whether the Frog Property or the Cache River Property contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. Our Current Business We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals with a focus on base and precious metals. Our current operational focus is to raise sufficient funds to continue exploration activities on our properties in Labrador, Canada, known as the Frog Property, Hook Property and the Cache River Property. We intend to conduct further exploration activities on the properties in 2024. We expect to review other potential exploration projects from time to time as they are presented to us. Cash Requirements There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the development stage and have not generated any revenues from activities. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business activities. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services. Over the next twelve months we intend to use any funds that we may have available to fund our Plan of Operation. Not accounting for our working capital deficit of 91,788 as of August 31, 2024, we require additional funds of approximately 114,000 (CDN 152,000) at a minimum to proceed with our plan of operation over the next twelve months. As we do not have the funds necessary to cover our projected operating expenses for the next twelve-month period, we will be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, through loans or through debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the required capital or that actual cash requirements will not exceed our estimates. We intend to fulfill any additional cash requirement through the sale of our equity securities. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion for our year ended May 31, 2023. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated. As at August 31, 2024, we had cash of 22, and had a working capital deficiency in the amount of 91,788. As August 31, 2024, we do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months. Plan of Operation The Plan of Operation for the next 12 months is to raise 114,000 (CDN 152,000) for the next phase of exploration program on the Frog Property. It is recommended that airborne magnetics and radiometrics surveys be completed over the Property. Rare earth mineralization is generally associated with uranium mineralization and radiometrics should define promising areas for follow-up examination. 4 
 The area of the strong magnetic anomaly is completely covered in glacial tills and no outcrop is evident. Prospecting should be completed expanding the 2021 range of coverage focusing on the north and south limits of the large magnetic anomaly at the cliff edges where the steep valley ridges demonstrate spalling of rocks into scree piles. Additional prospecting should be completed following the airborne geophysical surveys as well, focusing on both radiometric and magnetic anomalies. It is estimated that the next phase of exploration would cost 114,000 (Cdn 152,000), as itemized in Table 4. Program Description Cost Airborne Geophysics Property wide 56,250 (Cdn 75,000 Prospecting 7 people x 14 days 18,375 (Cdn 24,500 Mob/demob Helicopter/Float Plane 18,750 (Cdn 25,000 Analytical 100 samples 3,750 (Cdn 5,000 Camp 6,750 (Cdn 9,000 Contingencies ~ 10 10,125 (Cdn 13,500 Total 114,000 (Cdn 152,000 Table 4: Recommended Budget - Frog Property As at August 31, 2024, we did not have cash and we will need to raise additional financing to fund our plan of operation over the next 12 months. The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. Purchase of Significant Equipment We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment over the twelve months ending August 31, 2025. Corporate Offices We do not own any real property. Our principal business offices are located at #55-11020 Williams Road, Richmond British Columbia, Canada, V7A 1X8 at a cost of CDN 1,000 per month on a month-to-month basis. Employees Currently we do not have any employees. The Company utilizes consultants for the management, regulatory, administration, investor relations and geological functions of the Company. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12-month period. We will continue to retain consultants as required. 5 
 Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. For information regarding our Critical Accounting Policies, see the "Application of Critical Accounting Policies" section in our Form 10-K. Results of Operations Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the quarter ended August 31, 2024, which are included herein.

The change was primarily a result of an increase in loss on settlement of debt of 136,866 offset by a decrease in foreign exchange loss of 1,500. Expenses Our operating expenses for the three-month periods ended August 31, 2024 and Augst 31, 2023 are outlined in the table below: Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 General and administrative 119,764 93,244 Mineral property exploration costs 21,932 4,847 General and administrative expenses increased by 26,250 from 93,244 during the three months ended August 31, 2023, to 119,764 during the three months ended August 31, 2024. This increase was primarily as a result of an increase in consulting fees of 47,845 and other miscellaneous fees of 636 offset by a decrease in accounting fees of 19,506 and tax penalties and interest of 2,725. Mineral property exploration costs increased by 17,085 from 4,487 during the three months ended August 31, 2023, to 21,932 during the three months ended August 31, 2024. Mineral property exploration costs increased as a result of exploration costs incurred during exploration of the Frog Property. 6

The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in net loss of from 100,457 during the three months ended August 31, 2023, to 279,429 during the three months ended August 31, 2024, an increase in loss on settlement of debt of 136,866, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities from 19,593 used for operating assets and liabilities during the three months ended August 31, 2023, to 115,977 provided by operating assets and liabilities during the three months ended August 31, 2024. Financing Activities During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we received proceeds of 20,766 from a shareholder loan and common stock issued and subscribed. In the comparable period, we received 124,944 from common stock issued and subscribed. Contractual Obligations As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. Recent Accounting Standards The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 7 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Not required. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (also our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of August 31, 2024, the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president (also our principal executive officer, principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing evaluation, and in light of weakness identified in our internal controls over financial reporting which were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024, our president (also our principal executive officer, principal financial and accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not a party to any pending legal proceedings and, to the best of our knowledge, none of our property or assets are the subject of any pending legal proceedings Item 1A. Risk Factors Much of the information included in this annual report includes or is based upon estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements". Such forward looking statements include any projections and estimates made by us and our management in connection with our business operations. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Such estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements" involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We caution the reader that important factors in some cases have affected and, in the future, could materially affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in any such estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements". If we do not obtain additional financing, the business plan will fail. Our current operating funds are insufficient to complete the next phases of our proposed exploration program on our Labrador mineral claims. We will need to obtain additional financing in order to complete our business plan and our proposed exploration program. Our business plan calls for significant expenses in connection with the exploration of the Labrador Claims. We have not made arrangements to secure any additional financing. 8 
 Because we have only recently commenced business operations, we face a high risk of business failure and this could result in a total loss of your investment. We are not currently conducting any exploration and are in the initial stages of exploration of the Labrador Claims, and thus have no way to evaluate the likelihood of whether our company will be able to operate our business successfully. Our Company was incorporated on February 23, 2006, and to date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities, obtaining financing and preliminary exploration of the Labrador Claims. We have not earned any revenues and we have never achieved profitability as of the date of this annual report. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in the light of problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that our company plans to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We have no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that its business will prove successful, and we can provide no assurance to investors that our company will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If our company is unsuccessful in addressing these risks its business will likely fail and you will lose your entire investment in this offering. Because our company has only recently commenced business operations, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our company has never earned any revenue and our company has never been profitable. Prior to completing exploration on the Labrador Claims, we may incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues from the Labrador Claims, this could cause our company to fail and you will lose your entire investment in this offering. If we do not find a joint venture partner for the continued development of our mineral claims, we may not be able to advance exploration work. If the results of the exploration program are successful, we may try to enter into a joint venture agreement with a partner for the further exploration and possible production of the Labrador Claims. Our company would face competition from other junior mineral resource exploration companies who have properties that they deem to be attractive in terms of potential return and investment cost. In addition, if our company entered into a joint venture agreement, our company would likely assign a percentage of our interest in the Labrador Claims to the joint venture partner. If our company is unable to enter into a joint venture agreement with a partner, our company may fail and you may lose your entire investment in this offering. Because of the speculative nature of mineral property exploration, there is substantial risk that no commercially viable deposits will be found and our business will fail. Exploration for base and precious metals is a speculative venture involving substantial risk. We can provide investors with no assurance that the Labrador Claims contain commercially viable mineral deposits. The exploration program that our company will conduct on the Labrador Claims may not result in the discovery of commercially viable mineral deposits. Problems such as unusual and unexpected rock formations and other conditions are involved in base and precious metal exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. In such a case, we may be unable to complete our business plan and you could lose your entire investment. Because of the inherent dangers involved in base and precious metal exploration, there is a risk that our company may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business. The search for base and precious metals involves numerous hazards. As a result, our company may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Our company currently has no such insurance, nor do we expect to get such insurance in the foreseeable future. If a hazard were to occur, the costs of rectifying the hazard may exceed our asset value and cause our company to liquidate all of our assets resulting in the loss of your entire investment. 9 
 Because access to our company's mineral claims is often restricted by inclement weather, we will be delayed in exploration and any future mining efforts. Access to the Labrador mineral claims is restricted to the period between May and November of each year due to snow in the area. As a result, any attempts to visit, test, or explore the property are largely limited to these few months of the year when weather permits such activities. These limitations can result in significant delays in exploration efforts, as well as mining and production in the event that commercial amounts of minerals are found. Such delays can result in our company's inability to meet deadlines for exploration expenditures as defined by the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. This could cause the business venture to fail and the loss of your entire investment unless our company can meet the deadlines. As our company undertakes exploration of the Labrador Claims, we will be subject to compliance with government regulation that may increase the anticipated time and cost of its exploration program. There are several governmental regulations that materially restrict the exploration of minerals. Our company will be subject to the mining laws and regulations as contained in the Mineral Act of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador as we carry out our exploration program. We may be required to obtain work permits, post bonds and perform remediation work for any physical disturbance to the land in order to comply with these regulations. While our company's planned exploration program budgets for regulatory compliance, there is a risk that new regulations could increase our time and costs of doing business and prevent our company from carrying out our exploration program. Because market factors in the mining business are out of our control, our company may not be able to market any minerals that may be found. The mining industry, in general, is intensely competitive and we can provide no assurance to investors even if minerals are discovered that a ready market will exist from the sale of any base or precious metals found. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of base or precious metals. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in our company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital and you may lose your entire investment. Because our company holds a significant portion of our cash reserves in United States dollars, we may experience weakened purchasing power in Canadian dollar terms. Our company holds a significant portion of our cash reserves in United States dollars. Due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the value of these United States dollar reserves can result in both translation gains or losses in Canadian dollar terms. If there was to be a significant decline in the United States dollar versus the Canadian Dollar, our US dollar purchasing power in Canadian dollars would also significantly decline. Our company has not entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that our company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the May 31, 2023, financial statements, our company was incorporated on February 23, 2006, and has never generated any revenue, has a working capital deficiency, and has incurred operating losses since inception. As a result, our company's auditor has expressed substantial doubt about the ability of our company to continue as a going concern. Continued operations are dependent on our ability to complete equity or debt financings or generate profitable operations. Such financings may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 10 
 Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock. Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker- dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. OTC Markets has placed a "Shell Risk" identifier on the Company's page on OTC Markets website. OTC Markets has placed a "Shell Risk" identifier on the Company's page on OTC Markets website. The Company is not in agreement that it is a "Shell Company" as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act due to the operations conducted by the Company in the past few years in the technology sector, and that such operations have been more than nominal. If advisable or beneficial for the Company or its shareholders, the Company may elect to pursue the appeal process with OTC Markets to have the "Shell Risk" identifier removed. Item 2.
