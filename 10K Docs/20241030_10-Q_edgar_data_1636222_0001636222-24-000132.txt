 Advertising fees and related income Franchise fees 
 
 Franchise fee, development fee, and international territory fee payments received by the Company are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents a contract liability.

As the term of the franchise license is typically , substantially all of the franchise fee revenue recognized in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 30, 2023. Approximately million and million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, relates to restaurants that have not yet opened, so the fees are not yet being amortized. The weighted average remaining amortization period for deferred franchise and renewal fees related to open restaurants is years. The Company did not have any material contract assets as of September 28, 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Wingstop Inc. (collectively with its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, Wingstop, the Company, we, our, or us should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 (our Annual Report ). The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, below and Risk Factors beginning on page 11 of our Annual Report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
 We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday of each calendar year. Our fiscal quarters are comprised of 13 weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of a 53-week year, which contains 14 weeks. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each contain 52 weeks. 
 Overview 
 Wingstop is the largest fast casual chicken wings-focused restaurant chain in the world, with over 2,450 locations worldwide. We are dedicated to serving the world flavor through an unparalleled guest experience and offering of classic wings, boneless wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches, always cooked to order and hand-sauced-and-tossed in 12 bold, distinctive flavors. 
 The Company is primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98 of Wingstop s restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees. We believe our asset-light, highly-franchised business model generates strong operating margins and requires low capital expenditures, creating stockholder value through strong and consistent free cash flow and capital-efficient growth.

Key Performance Indicators 
 Key measures that we use in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business include the following: 
 Number of restaurants. Management reviews the number of new restaurants, the number of closed restaurants, and the number of acquisitions and divestitures of restaurants to assess net new restaurant growth. 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Domestic Franchised Activity: Beginning of period 1,988 1,749 1,877 1,678 Openings 79 42 191 116 Closures (1) Acquired by Company (3) (4) (2) Restaurants end of period 2,064 1,791 2,064 1,791 Domestic Company-Owned Activity: Beginning of period 52 45 49 43 Openings 1 1 3 1 Closures Acquired by Company 3 4 2 Restaurants end of period 56 46 56 46 Total Domestic Restaurants 2,120 1,837 2,120 1,837 International Franchised Activity (1) : 
 Beginning of period 312 252 288 238 Openings 28 13 55 30 Closures (2) (3) (5) (6) Restaurants end of period 338 262 338 262 Total System-wide Restaurants 2,458 2,099 2,458 2,099 
 
 (1) Including U.S. territories. 
 System-wide sales. System-wide sales represents net sales for all of our company-owned and franchised restaurants, as reported by franchisees. This measure allows management to better assess changes in our royalty revenue, our overall store performance, the health of our brand, and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Our system-wide sales growth is driven by new restaurant openings as well as increases in same store sales. 
 Domestic average unit volume AUV ). Domestic AUV consists of the average annual sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. This measure is calculated by dividing sales during the applicable period for all restaurants being measured by the number of restaurants being measured. Domestic AUV includes revenue from both company-owned and franchised restaurants. Domestic AUV allows management to assess our domestic company-owned and franchised restaurant economics. Changes in domestic AUV growth are primarily driven by increases in same store sales and are also influenced by opening new restaurants. 
 Domestic same store sales. Domestic same store sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the same store restaurant base. We define the same store restaurant base to include those restaurants open for at least 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing restaurants, while excluding the impact of new restaurant openings and permanent closures. We review same store sales for domestic company-owned restaurants as well as system-wide domestic restaurants. Domestic same store sales growth is driven by increases in transactions and average transaction size. Transaction size increases are driven by price increases or favorable mix shift from either an increase in items purchased or shifts into higher priced items. 
 15 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for losses on debt extinguishment and financing transactions, transaction costs, costs and fees associated with investments in our strategic initiatives, system implementation costs, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. For a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and for further discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP measures and how we utilize them, see footnote 2 below. 
 The following table sets forth our key performance indicators for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in thousands, except unit data): 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Number of system-wide restaurants open at end of period 2,458 2,099 2,458 2,099 System-wide sales (1)

The remainder was generated by franchised restaurants, as reported by our franchisees. 
 (2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
 We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Many investors are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations on a period-over-period basis and would ordinarily add back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, as well as items that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of our business. 
 Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 
 as a measurement of operating performance because we believe they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our restaurants on a consistent basis, as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations; 
 for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections; 
 to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; 
 to evaluate our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business; and 
 16 

to calculate incentive compensation payments for our employees, including assessing performance under our annual incentive compensation plan. 
 By providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for net income or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance. Some of the limitations are: 
 such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 such measures do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
 such measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Due to these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these non-GAAP measures only as performance measures and supplementally. As noted in the table below, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for losses on debt extinguishment and financing transactions, transaction costs, costs and fees associated with investments in our strategic initiatives, system implementation costs, and stock-based compensation expense. We believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our restaurants, and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other restaurant companies over time. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph and in the reconciliation table below help management measure our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations. 
 The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in thousands): 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net income 25,732 19,511 81,964 51,361 Interest expense, net 5,130 4,520 14,874 13,337 Income tax expense 9,756 6,640 28,512 17,959 Depreciation and amortization 5,054 3,384 13,625 9,591 EBITDA 45,672 34,055 138,975 92,248 Additional adjustments: Consulting fees (a)

 (a) Represents non-recurring consulting fees that are not part of our ongoing operations and are incurred to execute discrete, project-based strategic initiatives, which are included in Selling, general and administrative on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The costs incurred in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 include consulting fees relating to a comprehensive review of our long-term growth strategy for our domestic business to explore potential future initiatives, which review was completed in fiscal year 2023. Given the magnitude and scope of 
 17 

this strategic review that is not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, the Company considers the incremental consulting fees incurred with respect to the initiative not reflective of the ongoing costs to operate its business. 
 (b) System implementation costs represent non-recurring expenses incurred related to the development and implementation of new enterprise resource planning and human capital management technology, which are included in Selling, general and administrative on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
 (c) Includes non-cash, stock-based compensation, net of forfeitures.

 (1) Cost of sales includes all operating expenses of company-owned restaurants, including advertising expenses, but excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately. 
 Revenue 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, total revenue was 162.5 million, an increase of 45.4 million, or 38.8 , compared to 117.1 million in the comparable period in 2023. 
 
 Royalty revenue, franchise fees and other increased 21.2 million, of which 9.6 million was due to domestic same store sales growth of 20.9 , and 9.3 million was due to net new franchise restaurant development. Other revenue increased by 2.1 million primarily due to an increase in vendor rebates. 
 
 Advertising fees increased 16.8 million primarily due to a 39.4 increase in system-wide sales during the fiscal third quarter 2024. 3.2 million of the increase was due to an increase in the national advertising fund contribution rate to 5.3 from 5.0 , effective the first day of the fiscal second quarter 2024. 
 
 Company-owned restaurant sales increased 7.4 million, due to an increase of 4.9 million related to the addition of ten net new company-owned restaurants since the prior fiscal third quarter. The remainder of the increase was due to company-owned same store sales growth of 7.3 , which was driven primarily by an increase in transactions.

Cost of sales 
 The table below presents the major components of cost of sales (dollars in thousands): 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 In dollars As a of company-owned restaurant sales In dollars As a of company-owned restaurant sales Food, beverage and packaging costs 11,590 37.0 7,910 33.0 Labor costs 7,355 23.5 5,646 23.6 Other restaurant operating expenses 6,270 20.0 4,645 19.4 Vendor rebates (848) (2.7) (579) (2.4) Total cost of sales 24,367 77.8 17,622 73.6 
 Food, beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 37.0 in the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 33.0 in the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 42.9 increase in the cost of bone-in chicken wings as compared to the prior year period. Our purchases in the prior fiscal third quarter were tied primarily to the spot market, which benefited from significant deflation in the cost of bone-in chicken wings. 
 Labor costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 23.5 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, which was comparable to 23.6 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 20.0 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 19.4 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales was primarily due to an increase in the national advertising fund contribution rate to 5.3 from 5.0 , effective the first day of the fiscal second quarter 2024, as well as an increase in pre-opening expenses as compared to the prior year period. 
 Advertising expenses 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, advertising expenses were 61.0 million, an increase of 18.6 million compared to 42.4 million in the comparable period in 2023. Advertising expenses are recognized at the same time the related revenue is recognized, which does not necessarily correlate to the actual timing of the related advertising spend. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, SG A expense was 32.3 million, an increase of 9.2 million compared to 23.0 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase in SG A expense was driven by an increase in performance-based stock compensation and incentive compensation expense of 4.9 million primarily related to the Company s performance, an increase in headcount related expenses of 2.8 million to support the growth in our business, and an increase in consulting and other professional fees of 1.3 million associated with our strategic initiatives, including system implementation costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, depreciation and amortization was 5.1 million, an increase of 1.7 million compared to 3.4 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation expense for the software assets placed in service during the second fiscal quarter 2024 related to our MyWingstop technology platform. 
 Interest expense, net 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, interest expense, net was 5.1 million, an increase of 0.6 million compared to 4.5 million of interest expense, net in the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by additional interest income earned on our cash balances during the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 

20 

Income tax expense 
 During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, we recognized income tax expense of 9.8 million, yielding an effective tax rate of 27.5 , compared to an effective tax rate of 25.4 in the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the impact of nondeductible expenses for executive compensation during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024.

 Food, beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 35.9 in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 32.6 in the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 41.5 increase in the cost of bone-in chicken wings as compared to the prior year period. Our purchases in the prior fiscal year period were tied primarily to the spot market, which benefited from significant deflation in the cost of bone-in chicken wings. 
 Labor costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 23.4 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 24.0 in the comparable period in 2023. The decrease in company-owned restaurant wages as a percentage of sales was primarily due to leverage as a result of company-owned domestic same store sales growth of 9.1 .

 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, SG A expense was 85.6 million, an increase of 16.7 million compared to 68.8 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase in SG A expense was driven by an increase in performance-based stock compensation and incentive compensation expense of 7.3 million primarily related to the Company s performance, an increase in headcount related expenses of 6.8 million to support the growth in our business, and an increase in consulting and other professional fees of 1.6 million associated with our strategic initiatives, including system implementation costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and borrowings available under our securitized financing facility. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service requirements, dividend payments, and the repurchase of shares of our common stock (if any). Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or with negative working capital. We generally utilize available cash flows from operations to invest in our business, service our debt obligations, pay dividends, and repurchase shares of our common stock (if any). 
 Our primary sources of short-term and long-term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our 2022 Variable Funding Notes (as defined below). As of September 28, 2024, the Company had 84.0 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. 
 Based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations, combined with our securitized financing facility, including our 2022 Variable Funding Notes, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. 
 The following table shows summary cash flows information for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in thousands): 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 149,868 83,747 Investing activities (50,123) (33,499) Financing activities (88,285) (149,017) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 11,460 (98,769) 
 Operating activities . Our cash flows from operating activities are principally driven by sales at both franchise restaurants and company-owned restaurants, as well as franchise and development fees. We collect franchise royalties from our franchise owners on a weekly basis. Restaurant-level operating costs at our company-owned restaurants, unearned franchise and development fees, and corporate overhead costs also impact our cash flow from operating activities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 149.9 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, an increase of 66.1 million from net cash provided by operating activities of 83.7 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in operating income, coupled with the change in working capital due to timing of payments associated with our national advertising campaign and taxes. 
 Investing activities . Our net cash used in investing activities was 50.1 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, an increase of 16.6 million from net cash used in investing activities of 33.5 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to our technology investments, as well as the impact of additional restaurants acquired from franchisees as compared to the prior fiscal year period. 
 Financing activities . Our net cash used in financing activities was 88.3 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, a decrease of 60.7 million from net cash used in financing activities of 149.0 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in common stock repurchased under our Share Repurchase Program as compared to the prior fiscal year period, in which we initiated a 125.0 million accelerated share repurchase program, as well as principal payments made in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 23 

Securitized financing facility . On March 9, 2022, the Company completed a securitized financing transaction, pursuant to which Wingstop Funding LLC, a limited purpose, bankruptcy-remote, indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued 250 million of its Series 2022-1 3.734 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the "2022 Class A-2 Notes"), and entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes, Class A-1 (the 2022 Variable Funding Notes, and together with the 2022 Class A-2 Notes, the 2022 Notes ), which permits borrowings of up to a maximum principal amount of 200 million, subject to certain borrowing conditions, a portion of which may be used to issue letters of credit. The proceeds from the securitized financing transaction were used to pay related transaction fees and expenses, strengthen the Company's liquidity position and for general corporate purposes, which included a return of capital to the Company s stockholders. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2022 Variable Funding Notes as of September 28, 2024. 
 In addition to the 2022 Notes, the Company s outstanding debt consists of its existing Series 2020-1 2.84 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the 2020 Class A-2 Notes ). 
 During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to have a leverage ratio under the 2020 Class A-2 Notes and the 2022 Class A-2 Notes of less than 5.0x. Per the terms of the Company s debt agreements, principal payments can be suspended at the borrower s election until the repayment date, as long as the Company maintains a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x. Accordingly, the Company elected to suspend payments following the principal payment made in the second quarter of 2023, and the entire outstanding balance of the 2020 Class A-2 Notes and the 2022 Class A-2 Notes has been classified as long-term debt due after fiscal year 2026. 
 Dividends. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.22 per share of common stock in each of the first two quarters of 2024, and a quarterly dividend of 0.27 per share of common stock in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in aggregate declared dividends of 20.8 million, or 0.71 per share of common stock, during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024. On October 29, 2024 the Company s Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.27 per share, to be paid on December 6, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2024, totaling approximately 7.9 million. 
 We do not currently expect the restrictions in our debt instruments to impact our ability to make regular quarterly dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend program. However, any future declarations of dividends, as well as the amount and timing of such dividends, are subject to capital availability and the discretion of our Board of Directors, which must evaluate, among other things, whether cash dividends are in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program. On August 17, 2023, the Company announced a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to 250.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock (the Share Repurchase Program ). During the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 93,617 shares of its common stock at an average price of 373.68 per share. As of September 28, 2024, 61.1 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are identified and described in our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report, and there have been no material changes since the filing of our Annual Report.

 risks associated with litigation against us or our franchisees; 
 risks associated with the availability and cost of labor; 
 our ability to successfully advertise and market our business; 
 risks associated with changes in customer preferences, perceptions and eating habits; 
 risks associated with our future performance and operating results falling below the expectations of securities analysts and investors; 
 risks associated with the geographic concentration of our business; 
 the impact on our business from unexpected events such as international conflict or war and related sanctions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, epidemics and pandemics and severe weather; 
 our ability to comply with laws and government regulations, including those relating to food products, employment and franchising, advertising and consumer protection, or increased costs associated with new or changing regulations; 
 our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage for our business; 
 risks associated with damage to our reputation or lack of acceptance of our brand in existing or new markets; 
 risks associated with our expansion into international markets and foreign government restrictions on operations; 
 our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key employees; 
 25 

our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights; 
 the impact on our business from environmental, social and corporate governance matters; and 
 our ability to comply with the terms of our securitized debt financing and generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our significant debt service obligations thereunder. 
 The above list of factors is not exhaustive. Some of these and other factors are discussed in more detail under Risk Factors in our Annual Report. When considering forward-looking statements in this report or that we make in other reports or statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and future reports we file with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements made in this report speak only as of the date of the report, unless specified otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. Many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather, production, availability and other factors outside of our control, including inflation as compared to the prior year period. Although we enter into arrangements in an effort to mitigate the price volatility of food costs, there are no established fixed price markets for fresh bone-in chicken wings, so we may be subject to prevailing market conditions. Bone-in chicken wings accounted for approximately 19.5 and 16.2 of our company-owned restaurant cost of sales during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. A hypothetical 10 increase in the bone-in chicken wing costs would have increased costs of sales by approximately 1.3 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024. We do not engage in speculative financial transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk. Our long-term debt, including current portion, consisted entirely of the 720.9 million incurred under the 2020 Class A-2 Notes and the 2022 Class A-2 Notes as of September 28, 2024 (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs). The Company s predominantly fixed-rate debt structure has reduced its exposure to interest rate increases that could adversely affect its earnings and cash flows, but the Company remains exposed to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. The Company is exposed to interest rate increases under the 2022 Variable Funding Notes; however, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its 2022 Variable Funding Notes as of September 28, 2024. 
 27 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 28 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are currently involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims and actions resulting from employment-related and franchise-related matters. None of these matters, some of which are covered by insurance, has had a material effect on us, and, as of the date of this report, we are not party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

As of September 28, 2024, 61.1 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program.
