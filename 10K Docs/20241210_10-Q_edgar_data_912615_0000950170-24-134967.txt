 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company, we, us or our refer to Urban Outfitters, Inc., together with its subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 We operate under three reportable segments Retail, Nuuly and Wholesale. Our Retail segment includes our Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands. Our Retail segment consumer products and services are sold directly to our customers through our retail locations, websites, mobile applications, social media and third-party digital platforms, catalogs and customer contact centers and franchisee-owned stores. Our Nuuly segment includes the Nuuly brand, which offers customers a more sustainable way to explore fashion primarily through a monthly women s apparel subscription rental service. Our Wholesale segment primarily designs, develops and markets apparel, intimates, activewear and shoes. Our Wholesale segment includes our Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands that sell through department and specialty stores worldwide, digital businesses and our Retail segment.

Retail Segment 
 Our Retail segment omni-channel strategy enhances our customers brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shopping experience. All Company-owned Retail segment shopping channels are closely integrated, including retail locations, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designed to generate demand for the Retail segment omni-channel and not the separate store or digital channels. We manage and analyze our performance based on a single Retail segment omni-channel rather than separate channels and believe that the Retail segment omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance. 
 Our comparable Retail segment net sales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store and comparable digital channel net sales. A store is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least 12 full months, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year due to store specific closures from events such as damage from fire, flood and natural weather events. A digital channel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least 12 full months. Sales from stores and digital channels that do not fall within the definition of comparable store or digital channel are considered to be non-comparable. Franchise net sales and the effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non-comparable. 
 We monitor Retail segment metrics including customer traffic, conversion rates and average units per transaction at our stores and on our websites and mobile applications. We also monitor average unit selling price and transactions at our stores and average order value on our websites and mobile applications. We believe that changes in any of these metrics may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition.

 Wholesale Segment 
 Our Wholesale segment includes the Free People, FP Movement and Urban Outfitters brands that sell through department and specialty stores worldwide, third-party digital businesses and our Retail segment.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to 
 24 

make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses during the reporting period. 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended October 31, 2024.

Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were 1.36 billion, compared to 1.28 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The 80.7 million increase was attributable to a 36.8 million, or 3.2 , increase in Retail segment net sales, a 31.7 million, or 48.4 , increase in Nuuly segment net sales and a 12.2 million, or 17.4 , increase in Wholesale segment net sales. 
 The increase in our Retail segment net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was due to an increase of 19.4 million in non-comparable net sales and an increase of 17.4 million, or 1.5 , in Retail segment comparable net sales. Retail segment comparable net sales increased 5.8 at Anthropologie and 5.3 at Free People and decreased 8.9 at Urban Outfitters. Retail segment comparable net sales increased in both North America and Europe. The overall increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by low single-digit positive growth in both digital channel net sales and retail store net sales. The digital channel comparable net sales increase was driven by increases in sessions and units per transaction, while average order value decreased. Comparable store net sales increased as a result of higher store traffic and transactions, while conversion rate and units per transaction decreased. The increase in non-comparable net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the impact of the 23 net new Company-owned stores and restaurants opened since the prior comparable period and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. 
 25 

The increase in Nuuly segment net sales was primarily driven by a 51.2 increase in the average number of active subscribers in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in Wholesale segment net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was driven by a 13.1 million, or 20.3 , increase in Free People wholesale net sales due to an increase in net sales to specialty customers and department stores, partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale net sales. 
 Gross profit percentage for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to 36.5 of net sales from 35.5 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Gross profit increased to 497.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 from 454.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups for all segments primarily driven by Company cross-functional initiatives. Retail segment merchandise markdowns also improved, driven by lower merchandise markdowns at Urban Outfitters, which were partially offset by an increase at Free People. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate. 
 Total inventory at October 31, 2024, as compared to October 31, 2023, increased by 72.3 million, or 10.0 , to 793.3 million. Total Retail segment inventory increased by 8.1 due to a Retail segment comparable inventory increase of 3.7 and planned early receipts of holiday merchandise. Wholesale segment inventory increased by 41.6 due to the timing of receipts and to support increased net sales. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 23.2 million, or 6.7 , in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to 27.1 of net sales, compared to 27.0 of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support growth in our customer base and increased net sales in the Retail and Nuuly segments. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support growth in our customer base and increased net sales in the Retail and Nuuly segments, as well as increased store payroll expenses to support the Retail segment stores comparable net sales growth. 
 Income from operations was 9.4 of net sales, or 128.7 million, for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 8.5 of net sales, or 109.0 million, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in operating income dollars was primarily driven by the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in operating income rate was primarily driven by the improved gross profit rate. 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 24.2 compared to 24.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to the favorable impact of equity awards that vested in the current year quarter.

 The increase in our Retail segment net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was due to an increase of 83.9 million, or 2.6 , in Retail segment comparable net sales, and an increase of 47.8 million in non-comparable net sales. Retail segment comparable net sales increased 9.3 at Free People and 7.5 at Anthropologie and decreased 10.6 at Urban Outfitters. Retail segment comparable net sales increased in both North America and Europe. The overall increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in digital channel net sales and low single-digit positive growth in retail store net sales. The digital channel comparable net sales increase was driven by increases in sessions, while average order value and conversion rate decreased. Comparable store net sales increased as a result of higher store traffic and transactions, which were partially offset by a decrease in units per transaction. The increase in non-comparable net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the impact of the 31 net new Company-owned stores and restaurants opened since the prior comparable period and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. 
 The increase in Nuuly segment net sales was primarily driven by a 50.4 increase in the average number of active subscribers in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the comparable period of fiscal 2024. The increase in Wholesale segment net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was driven by a 25.4 million, or 15.1 , increase in Free People wholesale net sales due to an increase in net sales to specialty customers and department stores, partially offset by a 2.7 million decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale net sales. 
 Gross profit percentage for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 increased to 35.7 of net sales from 34.9 of net sales in the comparable period of fiscal 2024. Gross profit increased to 1.40 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 from 1.28 billion in the comparable period of fiscal 2024.

 Income from operations was 8.9 of net sales, or 348.5 million, for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 8.5 of net sales, or 312.5 million, for the comparable period of fiscal 2024.

 Our major source of cash from operations was merchandise sales and our primary outflow of cash from operations was for the payment of operational costs. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to higher inventory purchases in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 due in part to planned early receipts of holiday merchandise for the Retail segment and timing of receipts for the Wholesale segment. 
 28 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by the sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities, property and equipment and the initial cash payment for a tax credit investment, partially offset by the sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash paid for property and equipment in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 144.1 million and 151.0 million, respectively, which was primarily used to expand our fulfillment center network and store base in both periods. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily related to repurchases of our common shares under our share repurchase program and from employees to meet payroll tax withholding requirements on vested share-based awards. Cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily related to repurchases of our common shares from employees to meet payroll tax withholding requirements on vested share-based awards. 
 Credit Facilities 
 See Note 5, Debt, of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Company s debt. 
 Capital and Operating Expenditures 
 During fiscal 2025, we plan to open approximately 58 new Company-owned retail locations, expand or relocate certain existing retail locations, invest in new products, markets and brands, purchase inventory and rental product for our operating segments at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales volumes, upgrade our systems, improve and expand our digital capabilities, invest in omni-channel marketing when appropriate and repurchase our common shares. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we opened a new Nuuly fulfillment center in Raymore, Missouri in response to the growth in the number of Nuuly subscribers. We believe that our new brand initiatives, new store openings, merchandise expansion programs, international growth opportunities and our marketing, social media, website and mobile initiatives are significant contributors to our sales growth and plan to continue our investment in these initiatives for all brands. We anticipate our capital expenditures during fiscal 2025 will be approximately 210 million, primarily to support new store openings and new and expanded fulfillment and distribution centers. All fiscal 2025 capital expenditures are expected to be financed by cash flow from operating activities and existing cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our new store investments generally have the potential to generate positive cash flow within a year. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brand offerings, including additional franchise and joint venture agreements. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, availability under our current credit facilities and future cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to fund these initiatives. 
 Share Repurchases 
 See Note 8, Shareholders Equity, of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Company s share repurchases. 
 Other Matters

 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.
