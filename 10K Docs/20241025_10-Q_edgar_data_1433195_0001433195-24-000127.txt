 In January 2023, we entered into an amendment to the lease agreement for our San Diego facility.

 Granted Vested ) Forfeited ) Unvested as of September 30, 2024 
 Unvested RSUs as of September 30, 2024 were composed of million RSUs with only service conditions and million performance share units ("PSUs") with both service conditions and performance conditions. RSUs granted with only service conditions generally vest over a period, assuming continued employment through the applicable vesting date. The number of PSUs granted, as included in the above table, assumes achievement of the performance metric at of the performance target. The unvested PSUs as of September 30, 2024, are subject to vesting based on the achievement of pre-established performance metrics for the year ending December 31, 2024 and will vest over a period, assuming continued employment through each vesting date. The actual number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period will range from to of the target number of shares depending on achievement relative to the performance metric over the applicable period. 
 We recognized stock-based compensation expense for the RSUs and PSUs of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 million and million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of and , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the change in valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, state income taxes and non-deductible officers' compensation partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
 
 We assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and we establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We weigh all available positive and negative evidence, including our earnings history and results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Due to a history of cumulative losses, including permanent adjustments, and assessing all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized. Accordingly, we have been maintaining full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. However, based on our current and projected future earnings, we believe that there is reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence of sustained profitability may be achieved during the current year to reach a conclusion that part or all of our deferred tax assets may become realizable, resulting in a possible release of all or a portion of the valuation allowance. Such valuation allowance release may result in a material increase to our deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to our projection of earnings and level of profitability.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity should be read together with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a technology leader powering the future of the real estate industry. Our solutions are designed to enable our property manager customers to digitally transform their businesses, address critical business operations and deliver a better customer experience. Our products assist our customers with an interconnected and growing network of stakeholders in their business ecosystems, including property owners, real estate investment managers, rental prospects, residents, and service providers, and provide key functionality related to critical transactions across the real estate lifecycle, including screening potential tenants, sending and receiving payments and risk mitigation services. AppFolio s intuitive interface, coupled with streamlined and automated workflows, make it easier for our customers to eliminate redundant and manual processes so they can deliver a great experience for their network of stakeholders while improving financial and operational performance. 
 We rely heavily on our talented team of employees to execute our growth plans and achieve our long-term strategic objectives. We believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers' success, and we have worked hard not only to attract and retain talented individuals, but also to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment to motivate and develop our valuable human capital. As we navigate the challenges of increased competition for talent, we continue to evolve our compensation and employee reward practices. 
 Property management units under management . We believe that our ability to increase our number of property management units under management is an indicator of our market penetration, growth, and potential future business opportunities. We define property management units under management as active or committed units under management at the period end date. We had 8.5 million and 7.8 million property management units under management as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our core solutions and certain of our Value Added Services are offered on a subscription basis. Our core solutions subscription fees vary by property type and are designed to scale with the size of our customers businesses. We recognize revenue for subscription-based services on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available. We generally invoice monthly or, to a lesser extent, annually in advance of the subscription period. 
 We also offer certain Value Added Services, which are not covered by our subscription fees, on a per-use basis. Usage-based fees are charged either as a percentage of the transaction amount (e.g., for certain of our payment services) or on a flat fee per transaction basis with no minimum usage commitments (e.g., for our tenant screening and risk mitigation services). We recognize revenue for usage-based services in the period the service is rendered. Our payments services fees are recorded gross of the interchange and payment processing related fees. We generally invoice our usage-based services on a monthly basis or collect the fee at the time of service. A significant majority of our Value Added Services revenue comes from the use of our payment services, tenant screening services, and risk mitigation services. 
 In addition, we charge our customers for assistance onboarding onto our core solutions and for certain other non-recurring services. We generally invoice for these other services in advance of the services being completed and recognize revenue in the period the service is rendered. We generate revenue from the legacy customers of previously acquired businesses by providing services outside of our property management core solution platform. Revenue derived from these services is recorded in Other revenue. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 20,403 and 19,418 property management customers, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 Costs and Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization). Many of our Value Added Services are facilitated by third-party service providers. Cost of revenue paid to these third-party service providers includes the cost of electronic interchange and payment processing-related services to support our payments services, the cost of credit reporting services for our tenant screening services, and various costs associated with our risk mitigation service providers. These third-party costs vary both in amount and as a percent of revenue for each Value Added Service offering. Cost of revenue also includes personnel-related costs for our employees focused on customer service and the support of our operations (including salaries, performance-based compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation), platform infrastructure costs (such as data center operations and hosting-related costs), and allocated shared and other costs. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of capitalized software development costs and amortization of intangible assets. 
 Sales and Marketing.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount 2024 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Core solutions 46,030 39,756 6,274 16 132,974 115,440 17,534 15 Value Added Services 157,726 123,188 34,538 28 451,677 326,108 125,569 39 Other 1,977 2,496 (519) (21) 5,887 7,067 (1,180) (17) Total revenue 205,733 165,440 40,293 24 590,538 448,615 141,923 32 
 
 The increase in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily attributable to an increase in the usage of our payments, tenant screening, and risk mitigation services. During the three and nine- month periods ended September 30, 2024, we also experienced growth of 9 in the number of property management units under management compared to the same periods in the prior year, which drove growth in users of our subscription and usage-based services. 
 Our payment services experienced increased usage during the comparative periods as residents and property managers transacted more business online. 
 We expect total revenue for the year ending December 31, 2024 to increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 as we continue to add new customers and property management units under management, along with increased adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services. 
 
 Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount 2024 2023 Amount (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 71,631 62,739 8,892 14 205,878 176,801 29,077 16 Percentage of revenue 34.8 37.9 34.9 39.4 Stock-based compensation, included above 1,126 1,149 (23) (2) 3,261 2,905 356 12 Percentage of revenue 0.5 0.7 0.6 0.6 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased, primarily due to higher expenditures related to third-party service providers for delivering our Value Added Services, which increased by 10.4 million and 30.6 million, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increases in expenditures related to third-party service providers were (1) driven by greater adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services and (2) partially offset by decreases of 2.5 million and 2.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in personnel-related costs, including stock-based and performance-based compensation. The decreases included 2.4 million in severance and related personnel costs we incurred from the workforce reduction in the third quarter of 2023. 
 We expect cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the year ending December 31, 2024, to decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increased revenue from eCheck transaction fees, product mix, and continued leverage from headcount efficiencies.

The reductions were driven by reduced headcount and 3.8 million in severance and related personnel costs we incurred from the workforce reduction in the third quarter of 2023.

 Research and product development expense decreased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 1.5M reduction in personnel-related costs, including stock-based and performance-based compensation. This included 3.4 million in severance and related personnel costs we incurred from the workforce reduction in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Research and product development expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 3.2 million increase in allocated shared and other costs, driven by higher technology costs. This increase in allocated shared and other costs was partially offset by a 1.6 million reduction in personnel-related costs, including stock-based and performance-based compensation. This reduction included 3.4 million in severance and related personnel costs we incurred from the workforce reduction in the third quarter of 2023. 
 We expect research and product development expenses for the year ending December 31, 2024 to decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as we continue to leverage headcount efficiencies.

The increase in allocated shared and other costs was primarily due to a 4.3 million decrease in gains related to lease modifications recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in allocated shared and other costs of 2.6 million, driven by expenses to support our growth. 
 We expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending December 31, 2024 to decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as we continue to leverage headcount efficiencies.

 officers' compensation partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the change in valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, non-deductible officers' compensation and state income taxes, partially offset by tax benefits from stock-based compensation research and development tax credits. 
 Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, are significantly different primarily due to the substantial increase in our pre-tax income in the current year and changes in discrete tax benefits year over year. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity continue to be cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities totaling 331.4 million, as well as cash flows generated from our operations. We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including continued market acceptance of our software solutions, changes in the number of our customers, adoption and utilization of our Value Added Services by new and existing customers, the timing and extent of the introduction of new core functionality, products and Value Added Services, and the timing and extent of our investments across our organization. In addition, we have in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements to acquire or invest in new technologies or markets adjacent to those we serve today. Furthermore, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of shares of our Class A common stock from time to time. To date, we have repurchased 4.2 million of our Class A common stock under the share repurchase program. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 151,593 29,100 Net cash used in investing activities (107,497) (22,351) Net cash used in financing activities (31,188) (17,581) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 12,908 (10,832) 
 Operating Activities 
 Our primary source of operating cash inflows is cash collected from our customers in connection with their use of our core solutions and Value Added Services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures and third-party costs incurred to support the delivery of our software solutions. 
 The net increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to an increase in cash collections from customers. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities is generally composed of purchases of investment securities, maturities of investment securities, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to capitalized software development. 
 The net increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to higher purchases of available-for-sale investment securities. 
 Financing Activities

 The net increase in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to an increase in net share settlements for employee tax withholdings associated with the vesting of equity awards. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report that have had a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Investment Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 269.0 million of investment securities consisting of United States government and agency securities. The primary objective of investing in securities is to support our liquidity and capital needs. We did not purchase these investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 
 Our investment securities are exposed to market risk due to interest rate fluctuations. While fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our interest income from our investment securities as all of these securities have fixed interest rates, changes in interest rates may impact the fair value of the investment securities. Since our investment securities are held as available for sale, all changes in fair value impact our other comprehensive (loss) income unless an investment security is considered impaired in which case changes in fair value are reported in other expense. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 1.1 million and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 1.1 million. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model which measures an instant change in interest rates by 100 basis points at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the supervision and participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at the reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
