NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) . Management determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets and liabilities are included in property and equipment and finance lease liabilities, respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The Company elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. When determining lease terms, the Company factors in options to extend or terminate leases when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain leases the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: Current portion of operating lease liability Long-term portion of operating lease liability Total operating lease liability years years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases Maturities of lease liabilities were as follows: 2025 2026 Total lease payments Less imputed interest Total The components of lease expense for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: Short-term lease costs Total operating lease costs 11 Table of Contents QUOTEMEDIA, INC.

A total of shares of the Company s preferred stock are designated as Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock has no dividend or voting rights. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock were outstanding. No shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock were issued or redeemed during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Redemption Rights Holders of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock shall have the right to convert their shares into shares of common stock at the rate of shares of common stock for one share of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, at any time following the date the closing price of a share of common stock on a securities exchange or actively traded over-the-counter market has exceeded for ninety ) consecutive trading days. The conversion rights are subject to the availability of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any distribution or payment is made to any holders of any shares of common stock, the holders of shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to be paid first out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to holders of the Company s capital stock whether such assets are capital, surplus, or earnings, an amount equal to 25.00 per share of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 480-10-S99, because a limited number of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock could be redeemed at the holder s option if the above criteria are met, it was classified as mezzanine equity and not permanent equity. On April 26, 2024, the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock was amended removing the above redemption right, at no cost to the Company, resulting in a change in the classification of Series A redeemable preferred stock from mezzanine equity to permanent equity. In addition, the amendment resulted in a change to the classification of warrants to purchase shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock warrants from preferred stock warrant liability to additional paid-in capital. There was no impact on the consolidated statement of operations resulting from the amendment. b) Common stock No shares of common stock were issued during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. c) Stock Options and Warrants FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation , requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the service period (generally the vesting period) in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values. The impact of forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized. 12 Table of Contents QUOTEMEDIA, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Total stock-based compensation expense Common Stock Options and Warrants The following table summarizes the Company s common stock option and warrant activity for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024: Granted during the period Forfeited during the period Outstanding at September 30, 2024 The following table summarizes the weighted average remaining contractual life and exercise price of common stock options and warrants outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2024: At September 30, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options and warrants granted to purchase common stock. Management calculates the fair value of stock options and warrants granted to purchase common stock under the provisions of FASB ASC 718 using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: N/A Risk-free interest rate N/A N/A N/A Expected life of options (years) N/A N/A N/A Weighted average fair value of options and warrants granted N/A N/A N/A All stock options and warrants to purchase common stock have been granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate intrinsic value of options and warrants outstanding and exercisable was . The intrinsic value of stock options and warrants are calculated as the amount by which the market price of the Company s common stock exceeds the exercise price of the option or warrant. 13 Table of Contents QUOTEMEDIA, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Compensation Preferred Stock Warrants at an exercise price equal to per share. Also pursuant to the Compensation Agreement with Mr. Shworan, on December 28, 2017 the Company issued Mr. Shworan warrants to purchase up to shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred Stock at an exercise price equal to per share liquidity preferred stock warrant ). The liquidity preferred stock warrants only vest and become exercisable on the consummation of a liquidity event as defined in the Company s Certificate of Designation of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. The probability of the liquidity event performance condition is not currently determinable or probable; therefore, no compensation expense has been recognized as of September 30, 2024. The probability is re-evaluated each reporting period. As of September 30, 2024, there was in unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these liquidity preferred stock warrants. Since the liquidity preferred stock warrants only vest and become exercisable on the consummation of a liquidity event which is currently determined not to be probable, management is also unable to determine the weighted-average period over which the unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized. As of September 30, 2024, there were a total of preferred stock warrants outstanding with a weighted average remaining contractual life of years. As of September 30, 2024, preferred stock warrants were exercisable. No preferred stock warrants were granted or exercised for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Reclassification of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability resulting from Amendment to Redemption Rights As discussed in note 6 a), the amendment to the redemption rights for the Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock resulted in a change to the classification of preferred stock warrants on April 26, 2024. The preferred stock warrant liability of was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. There was no impact on the consolidated statement of operations resulting from the amendment. Fair Value Measurement of Compensation Preferred Stock Warrants The Company adheres to ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements; accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company could access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 14 Table of Contents QUOTEMEDIA, INC.

Management s Discussion and Analysis The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. We caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the following discussion, elsewhere in this report, and in any other statements, made by, or on behalf of our company, whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or on behalf of, our company. Uncertainties and contingencies that might cause such differences include those risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other reports filed from time to time with the SEC. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. All references to we , our , us , or QuoteMedia refer to QuoteMedia, Inc., and its predecessors, operating divisions, and subsidiaries. This report should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Overview We are a developer of financial software and a distributor of market data and research information to online brokerages, clearing firms, banks, media properties, public companies, and financial service corporations worldwide. Through the aggregation of information from many direct data, news, and research sources, we offer a comprehensive range of solutions for all market-related information provisioning requirements. We have three general product lines: Interactive Content and Data APIs, Data Feed Services, and Portfolio Management Systems. For financial reporting purposes, our product categories share similar economic characteristics and share costs; therefore, they are combined into one reporting segment. Our Interactive Content and Data APIs consist of a suite of software applications that provide publicly traded company and market information to corporate clients via the Internet. Products include stock market quotes, fundamentals, historical and interactive charts, company news, filings, option chains, insider transactions, corporate financials, corporate profiles, screeners, market research information, investor relations provisions, level II, watch lists, and real-time quotes. All our content solutions are completely customizable and embedded directly into client Web pages for seamless integration with existing content. We are continuing to develop and launch new modules of QMod TM , our new proprietary Web delivery system. QMod was created for secure market data provisioning as well as ease of integration and unlimited customization. Additionally, QMod delivers search engine optimized (SEO) ready responsive content designed to adapt on the fly when rendered on mobile devices or standard Web pages automatically resizing and reformatting to fit the device on which it is displayed. Our Data Feed Services consist of raw streaming real-time market data delivered over the Internet or via dedicated telecommunication lines. We provide supplemental fundamental, historical, and analytical data, keyed to the same symbology, which provides a complete market data solution offered to our customers. Currently, QuoteMedia s Data Feed services include complete coverage of North American exchanges and over 70 exchanges worldwide. For financial reporting purposes, Data Feed Services revenue is included in the Interactive Content and Data APIs revenue totals. Our Portfolio Management Systems consist of Quotestream TM , Quotestream Mobile, Quotestream Professional, and our Web Portfolio Management systems. Quotestream Desktop is an Internet-based streaming online portfolio management system that delivers real-time and delayed market data to both consumer and corporate markets. Quotestream has been designed for syndication and private branding by brokerage, banking, and Web portal companies. Quotestream s enhanced features and functionality most notably tick-by-tick true streaming data, significantly enhanced charting features, and a broad range of additional research and analytical content and functionality offer a professional-level experience to nonprofessional users.

Quotestream Mobile is a true companion product to the Quotestream desktop products (Quotestream and Quotestream Professional) any changes made to portfolios in either the desktop or mobile application are automatically reflected in the other. 17 Table of Contents A key feature of QuoteMedia s business model is that all our product lines generate recurring monthly licensing revenue from each client. Contracts to license Quotestream to our corporate clients, for example, typically have a term of one to five years and are automatically renewed unless notice is given at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the current license term. We also generate Quotestream revenue through individual end-user licenses on a monthly or annual subscription fee basis. Interactive Content and Data APIs and Market Data Feeds are licensed for a monthly, quarterly, annual, or semi-annual subscription fee. Contracts to license our Financial Data Products and Data Feeds typically have a term of one to five years and are automatically renewed unless notice is given 90 days prior to the expiration of the contract term. Business Environment and Trends While our licensed-based revenue is generally more recurring in nature, the uncertainty caused by the recent market downturn and rising inflation may result in some clients to delay purchasing decisions, product and service implementations or cancel or reduce spending with us. Events in Ukraine and Russia have continued to cause disruptions in the global financial markets. While we do not have any operations or customers in Ukraine or Russia, we will continue to monitor the situation as a prolonged conflict could impact our business. Approximately 39 of our revenue and expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars. The Canadian dollar remained relatively unchanged against the U.S. dollar when comparing the average exchange rate for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparative 2023 period. Because our Canadian dollar revenue and expenses are evenly matched, exchange rate fluctuations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flows. Our revenue decreased 1 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparative 2023 period. Based on revenue already under contract, we expect to return to positive revenue growth in fiscal 2025. Plan of Operation For the remainder of 2024 we plan to continue to expand our product lines and improve our infrastructure. We plan to continue to add more features and data to our existing products and release newer versions with improved performance and flexibility for client integration. This expansion is expected to result in both increased revenue and costs for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We will maintain our focus on marketing Quotestream for deployments by brokerage firms to their retail clients and continue our expansion into the investment professional market with Quotestream Professional. We also plan to continue the growth of our Data Feed Services client base, particularly through the addition of major new international data feed coverage, as well as new data delivery products. QuoteMedia will continue to focus on increasing the sales of its Interactive Content and Data APIs, particularly in the context of large-scale enterprise deployments encompassing solutions ranging across several product lines. QMod is a major component of this strategy, given the broad demand for mobile-ready, SEO-friendly Web content. Important development projects for the remainder of 2024 include broad expansion of data and news coverage, including the addition of a wide array of international exchange data and news, video feeds, expansion of fixed-income coverage, and the introduction of several new and upgraded market information products. New deployments of our trade integration capabilities, which allow our Quotestream applications to interact with our brokerage clients back-end trade execution and reporting platforms (enabling on-the-fly trade execution and tracking of holdings) are underway and will continue to be a priority for the remainder of 2024. We are also creating new proprietary data sets, analytics, and scoring mechanisms. We are now aggregating data direct from the sources to produce data sets that are proprietary to QuoteMedia. This allows us to offer our clients new data products and lower our product costs structure as we replace some of our existing data providers with our own lower cost data. Opportunistically, efforts will be made to evaluate and pursue the development of additional new products that may eventually be commercialized by our company. Although not currently anticipated, we may require additional capital to execute our proposed plan of operation. There can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available to our company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our future performance will be subject to a number of business factors, including those beyond our control, such as a continuation of market uncertainty and evolving industry needs and preferences, as well as the level of competition and our ability to continue to successfully market our products and technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our marketing strategy, continue our revenue growth, or maintain profitable operations. 18 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the 2023 Annual Report, we disclose our critical accounting policies and estimates upon which our consolidated financial statements are derived. There have been no material changes to these policies since December 31, 2023. Readers are encouraged to read the 2023 Annual Report in conjunction.

Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. We capitalize the costs associated with developing new products during the application development stage. Our cost of revenue increased 10 and 5 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparative periods in 2023. This was mainly due to increased amortization expenses associated with internally developed application software resulting from our major growth initiative, which included investing in infrastructure, new product development, data collection, and the expansion of our global market coverage. Overall, the cost of revenue increased as a percentage of sales, as evidenced by our gross margin percentage that decreased to 46 and 48 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 from 52 and 51 in the comparative 2023 periods.

Increases in personnel costs were due to additional sales personnel hired since the comparative periods to support our product growth initiatives and salary increases for existing personnel General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries expense, office rent, insurance premiums, and professional fees. General and administrative expenses increased 2 for the three-months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, due to increases in bad debt expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 3 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to increases in bad debt expenses offset by decreased professional fees as we incurred additional professional fees in the comparative 2023 period resulting from the change of principal accountants in January 2023. Software Development Software development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the design, programming, and testing of our software applications during the preliminary project stage. Software development expenses also include costs incurred to maintain our software applications. Software development expenses increased 6 and 16 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to new personnel hired since the comparative periods to improve our infrastructure, security, and business continuity management. 20 Table of Contents We capitalized 909,035 and 2,591,750 of development costs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 812,428 and 2,387,774 in the same periods in 2023.

Other Income and (Expense) Summary Three-months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Foreign exchange gain (loss) (31,881 21,803 Interest expense, net 76 825 Total other income (expense), net (31,805 22,628 Nine-months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 3,841 (16,271 Interest expense, net (1,296 (1,031 Total other income (expenses), net 2,545 (17,302 Foreign Exchange Gain We incurred a foreign exchange loss of 31,881 and a foreign exchange gain of 3,841 for the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to a foreign exchange gain of 21,803 and a foreign exchange loss of 16,271 in the comparative 2023 periods. Foreign exchange gains and losses arise from the re-measurement of Canadian dollar monetary assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and from exchange rate fluctuations between transaction and settlement dates for foreign currency denominated transactions. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense is netted against interest earned on cash balances. Net interest income of 76 and net interest expense of 1,296 were incurred for the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to net interest income of 825 and net interest expense of 1,031 incurred in the same 2023 periods. Provision for Income Taxes For the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 738 and 2,206 in Canadian income tax expenses compared to 739 and 2,221 in the comparative periods in 2023. Net Income (Loss) for the Period As a result of the foregoing, our net losses for the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024 were 440,941 and 720,290 compared to net income of 126,036 and 312,362 in the comparative periods in 2023. The basic and diluted loss per share was (0.00) for the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.00 for the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash totaled 291,217 at September 30, 2024, as compared with 342,014 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 50,797. Net cash of 2,575,327 was provided by operations for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to adjustments for non-cash charges and the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, offset by our net loss and an increase in accounts receivable. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,626,124, due to capitalized application software costs and purchases of computer equipment. We typically operate with a working capital deficit. As of September 30, 2024, our working capital deficit was 3,330,119, however current liabilities include 2,027,800 in deferred revenue. The expected costs necessary to realize the deferred revenue are minimal. If circumstances dictate, we have the flexibility to reduce development spending to maintain a strong liquidity position. 21 Table of Contents Based on the factors discussed above, we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next 12 months through October 2025. However, implementing our business plan may require additional financing. Additional financing may come from future equity or debt offerings that could result in dilution to our stockholders. Further, current adverse capital and credit market conditions could limit our access to capital. We may be unable to raise capital or bear an unattractive cost of capital that could reduce our financial flexibility. Our long-term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which we expand our business and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions. To the extent that the funds generated from operations are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term, we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that, if it is available, it will be on terms acceptable to us. Foreign Exchange Risk Currently, approximately 39 of our consolidated revenue and expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars. Since currently our Canadian dollar revenue and expenses are closely matched, our consolidated cashflows are not significantly impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, or other off-balance sheet arrangements. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Audit Committee, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described below our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented herein. The following material weaknesses were identified during the preparation and review of the current period financial statements: There is a lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 23 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 6.
