Under this contract, each unit of product delivered to the customer represents a separate performance obligation; therefore, future volumes are wholly unsatisfied and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required. The Company also performs water services for third-party customers and such contracts are short-term in nature with a contract term of one year or less. Accordingly, the Company is exempt from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of year or less.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The information provided below supplements, but does not form part of, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the views and beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions and estimates made by our management. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements as a result of various risk factors, including those that may not be in the control of management. For further information on items that could impact our future operating performance or financial condition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law. In this section, references to Antero Midstream, AM, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Antero Midstream Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. Overview We are a growth-oriented midstream energy company formed to own, operate and develop midstream energy assets to primarily service Antero Resources production and completion activity. We believe that our strategically located assets and our relationship with Antero Resources have allowed us to become a leading midstream energy company serving the Appalachian Basin and present opportunities to expand our midstream services to other operators in the Appalachian Basin. Our assets consist of gathering pipelines, compressor stations and interests in processing and fractionation plants that collect and process production from Antero Resources wells in the Appalachian Basin in West Virginia and Ohio. Our assets also include two independent water handling systems that deliver water from the Ohio River and several regional waterways. These water handling systems consist of permanent buried pipelines, surface pipelines and water storage facilities, as well as pumping stations, blending facilities and impoundments. Portions of these water handling systems are also utilized to transport flowback and produced water. These services are provided by us directly or through third-parties with which we contract. Asset Acquisition On May 1, 2024, we acquired certain Marcellus gas gathering and compression assets from Summit for 70 million in cash, before closing adjustments, with an effective date of April 1, 2024. This acquisition was funded with our operating cash flow. The acquired assets include 48 miles of high pressure gathering pipelines and two compressor stations with 100 MMcf/d of compression capacity. These assets were already interconnected to our low pressure and high pressure gas gathering systems at the time of acquisition and service Antero Resources production. Currently, we do not expect to make any significant capital investments related to the acquired assets. See Note 6 Property and Equipment to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Financing Highlights Credit Facility On July 30, 2024, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our senior secured revolving credit facility with lender commitments of 1.25 billion, which matures on July 30, 2029 (subject to certain terms and conditions related to the outstanding balances to our 2027, 2028 and 2029 notes). See Note 7 Long-Term Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Senior Notes Issuance of 2032 Senior Notes On January 16, 2024, we issued 600 million of 2032 Notes at par. The 2032 Notes are unsecured and effectively subordinated to the Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Credit Facility. The 2032 Notes rank pari passu to our other outstanding senior notes and are guaranteed on a full and unconditional and joint and several senior unsecured basis by our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain of our future restricted subsidiaries. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay outstanding borrowings on the Credit Facility. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.

 Repurchase of 2026 Senior Notes During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased or otherwise fully redeemed 550 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a weighted average premium of 101.975 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2026 Notes were retired as of May 16, 2024. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Share Repurchase Program On February 13, 2024, our Board authorized a share repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to 500 million of shares of our outstanding common stock. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us is not guaranteed and the program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The 1 U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 applies to our share repurchase program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under this program. Market Conditions and Business Trends Commodity Markets Benchmark prices for natural gas decreased significantly, while benchmark prices for oil remained consistent and benchmark prices for NGLs increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. While substantially all of our revenues are based on fixed-fee contracts that are not directly impacted by changes in commodity prices, commodity price changes do impact the revenues and cash flows of Antero Resources, and Antero Resources drilling and development plan does have a direct impact on our gathering, compression and water handling services, revenues and cash flows. In the current economic environment, we expect that commodity prices for some or all of the commodities produced by Antero Resources could remain volatile. However, due to Antero Resources improved liquidity and leverage position as compared to historical levels, we do not expect to experience significant variability in our throughput volumes resulting from volatile commodity prices. Economic Indicators The economy experienced elevated inflation levels as a result of global supply and demand imbalances, where global demand outpaced supplies beginning in 2021 and continuing through the third quarter of 2024. For example, the Consumer Price Index CPI for all urban consumers increased 3.7 from September 2022 to September 2023 and an additional 2.4 from September 2023 to September 2024 as compared to the Federal Reserve s stated goal of 2 . In order to manage the inflation risk present in the United States economy, the Federal Reserve utilized monetary policy in the form of interest rate increases beginning in March 2022 in an effort to bring the inflation rate in line with its stated goal of 2 on a long-term basis. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds interest rate by 5.25 . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, inflation rates began to approach the Federal Reserve s stated goal of 2 , and the Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate by 0.5 in September 2024. While inflationary pressures in the United States economy have begun to subside, we continue to be impacted by the increased federal funds interest rate. See Results of Operations for additional information. The economy also continues to be impacted by global events. These events have often caused global supply chain disruptions with additional pressure due to trade sanctions on Russia and other global trade restrictions, among others. However, neither our nor Antero Resources supply chain has experienced any significant interruptions due to such events. Inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions could result in further increases to our operating and capital costs that are not fixed. However, our gathering and compression and water agreements provide for annual CPI-based adjustments that mitigate a portion of such inflationary pressures. These economic variables are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and future cash flows.

 Results of Operations We have two reportable segments: (i) gathering and processing and (ii) water handling. The gathering and processing segment includes a network of gathering pipelines and compressor stations that collect and process production from Antero Resources wells in the Appalachian Basin, as well as equity in earnings from our investments in the Joint Venture and Stonewall. The Joint Venture and Stonewall provide processing and fractionation services and high-pressure gas gathering services, respectively, in the Appalachian Basin.

 Not meaningful or applicable. (1) The average realized fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include annual CPI-based adjustments of approximately 1.6 . Revenues. Total revenues increased by 2 , from 264 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 270 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Total revenues included amortization of customer relationships of 18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Gathering and processing revenues increased by 10 , from 206 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 226 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Water handling revenues decreased by 24 , from 58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 44 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These fluctuations primarily resulted from the following: Gathering and Processing Low pressure gathering revenue increased 13 million period over period primarily due to lower growth incentive fee rebates of 12 million due to the expiration of the program on December 31, 2023 and increased low pressure gathering rates as a result of annual CPI-based adjustments, partially offset by decreased throughput volumes of 4 Bcf, or 46 MMcf/d. Low pressure gathering volumes decreased between periods primarily due to natural production decline, partially offset by 67 additional wells being connected to our system since September 30, 2023. Compression revenue increased 1 million period over period primarily due to increased compression rates as a result of annual CPI-based adjustments. Compression volumes remained consistent between periods primarily due to 67 additional wells being connected to our system since September 30, 2023 and two compressor stations that were acquired during the second quarter of 2024, fully offset by natural production decline between periods. High pressure gathering revenue increased 6 million period over period primarily due to our acquisition of 48 miles of high pressure gathering lines during the second quarter of 2024 and increased high pressure gathering rates as a result of an annual CPI-based adjustment.

 Water Handling Fresh water delivery revenue decreased 13 million period over period primarily due to decreased fresh water delivery volumes of 3 MMBbl, or 35 MBbl/d, partially offset by a 1.6 increase to the fresh water delivery rate for our long-term contract with Antero Resources as a result of the annual CPI-based adjustment. Fresh water delivery volumes decreased between periods primarily due to fewer wells serviced by our fresh water delivery system as a result of the timing of well completions by Antero Resources. Other fluid handling services revenue decreased 1 million period over period primarily due to lower other fluid handling volumes of 0.2 MMBbl, or 2 MBbl/d, between periods. 
 Direct operating expenses. Direct operating expenses remained consistent at 52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Gathering and processing direct operating expenses increased by 4 , from 24 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 25 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to our acquisition of two compressor stations and 48 miles of high pressure gathering lines during the second quarter of 2024. Water handling direct operating expenses decreased by 4 , from 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 27 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to decreased fresh water delivery volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by increased pipeline maintenance, repair and monitoring activities between periods. General and administrative (excluding equity-based compensation) expenses. General and administrative expenses (excluding equity-based compensation expense) increased by 18 from 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher costs allocated to us from Antero Resources. Equity-based compensation expenses. Equity-based compensation expenses increased from 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to annual equity-based awards granted during the first quarter of 2024. Our equity-based awards vest over three or four year service periods. See Note 9 Equity-Based Compensation to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Depreciation expense. Depreciation expense remained relatively consistent at 31 million and 33 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by 6 , from 55 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower Credit Facility borrowings between periods and lower interest expense on our Senior Notes due to the repurchase and redemption of the 550 million principal amount of the 2026 Notes during the first and second quarters of 2024, partially offset by the issuance of 600 million principal amount of 2032 Notes during the first quarter of 2024. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates remained relatively consistent at 27 million and 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Income tax expense. Income tax expense remained relatively consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 at 37 million and 38 million, respectively, which reflects effective tax rates of 27.3 and 27.7 , respectively.

 Not meaningful or applicable. (1) The average realized fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include annual CPI-based adjustments of approximately 1.6 . Revenues. Total revenues increased by 5 , from 782 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 819 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total revenues included amortization of customer relationships of 53 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Gathering and processing revenues increased by 11 , from 598 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 664 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Water handling revenues decreased by 16 , from 184 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 155 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These fluctuations primarily resulted from the following: Gathering and Processing Low pressure gathering revenue increased 45 million period over period primarily due to lower growth incentive fee rebates of 36 million due to the expiration of the program on December 31, 2023, increased throughput volumes of 7 Bcf, or 12 MMcf/d, and increased low pressure gathering rates as a result of annual CPI-based adjustments. Low pressure gathering volumes increased between periods primarily due to 67 additional wells being connected to our system since September 30, 2023 . Compression revenue increased 6 million period over period primarily due to increased throughput volumes of 14 Bcf, or 39 MMcf/d, and increased compression rates as a result of annual CPI-based adjustments. Compression volumes increased between periods primarily due to 67 additional wells being connected to our system since September 30, 2023 and two compressor stations that were acquired during the second quarter of 2024. High pressure gathering revenue increased 15 million period over period primarily due to increased throughput volumes of 35 Bcf, or 116 MMcf /d and increased high pressure gathering rates as a result of an annual CPI-based adjustment. The high pressure gathering volumes increased period over period primarily due to 67 additional wells being connected to our system since September 30, 2023 and our acquisition of 48 miles of high pressure gathering lines during the second quarter of 2024.

 Water Handling Fresh water delivery revenue decreased 24 million period over period primarily due to decreased fresh water delivery volumes of 6 MMBbl, or 24 MBbl/d, partially offset by a 1.6 increase to the fresh water delivery rate for our long-term contract with Antero Resources as a result of the annual CPI-based adjustment. Fresh water delivery volumes decreased between periods primarily due to fewer wells serviced by our fresh water delivery system as a result of the timing of well completions by Antero Resources. Other fluid handling services revenue decreased 5 million period over period primarily due to decreased water trucking volumes, which are billed at cost plus 3 , and lower high rate transfer services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by higher blending cost of service fees between periods. 
 Direct operating expenses. Direct operating expenses remained consistent at 162 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Gathering and processing direct operating expenses increased by 6 , from 73 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 77 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increased gathering and compression volumes between periods and our acquisition of two compressor stations and 48 miles of high pressure gathering lines during the second quarter of 2024. Water handling direct operating expenses decreased by 5 , from 89 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 85 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower fresh water volumes and decreased wastewater handling costs between periods, partially offset by increased pipeline maintenance, repair and monitoring activities. General and administrative (excluding equity-based compensation) expenses. General and administrative expenses (excluding equity-based compensation expense) increased by 8 , from 30 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher costs allocated to us from Antero Resources. Equity-based compensation expenses. Equity-based compensation expenses increased from 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 33 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to annual equity-based awards granted during the first quarter of 2024. Our equity-based awards vest over three or four year service periods. See Note 9 Equity-Based Compensation to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Depreciation expense. Depreciation expense increased by 6 , from 101 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 107 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to 3 million related to assets placed in service, 2 million of higher expense related to our program to repurpose underutilized compressor units to expand existing or construct new compressor stations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1 million for our assets acquired during the second quarter of 2024. Loss on asset sale. Loss on asset sale of 6 million and 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, was primarily due to sales of miscellaneous equipment. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by 5 , from 165 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 157 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower Credit Facility borrowings between periods and lower interest expense on our Senior Notes due to the repurchase and redemption of the remaining 550 million principal amount of the 2026 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the issuance of 600 million principal amount of 2032 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by 6 , from 78 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increased processing and fractionation volumes and higher processing and fractionation fees as a result of annual CPI-based adjustments between periods . Loss on early extinguishment of debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased or otherwise fully redeemed the 550 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a weighted average premium of 101.975 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and recognized a loss on early debt extinguishment of 14 million. There was no loss on early extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.

 Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 6 , from 97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 103 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflects effective tax rates of 26.4 and 26.3 , respectively. The increase in income tax expense between periods is primarily due to higher income before income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Capital Resources and Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Capital resources and liquidity are provided by operating cash flows and available borrowings under our Credit Facility and capital market transactions. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We expect that the combination of these capital resources will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements, capital expenditures program and expected quarterly cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. Our Board declared a cash dividend on the shares of our common stock of 0.2250 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The dividend is payable on November 6, 2024 to stockholders of record as of October 23, 2024. Our Board also declared a cash dividend of 137,500 on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock that is payable on November 14, 2024 in accordance with their terms as discussed in Note 11 Equity and Net Income Per Common Share. As of September 30, 2024, there were dividends in the amount of 68,750 accumulated in arrears on our Series A Preferred Stock. We expect our future cash requirements relating to working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders will be funded from cash flows internally generated from our operations or borrowings under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2024 Net cash provided by operating activities 570,742 611,303 Net cash used in investing activities (129,508) (203,076) Net cash used in financing activities (441,234) (408,293) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (66) Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 571 million and 611 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operations between periods was primarily due to higher gathering and processing revenues and increased distributions from our equity method investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by lower water handling revenues and changes in working capital between periods. Investing activities. Net cash flows used in investing activities was 130 million and 203 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities between periods was primarily due to our acquisition of gathering and compression assets during the second quarter of 2024 of 70 million, before closing adjustments, and increased capital spending for our gathering and processing systems of 20 million as a result of increased compression station and high pressure line capital projects between periods, partially offset by decreased capital spending for our water handling systems of 16 million primarily as a result of fewer capital projects between periods. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was 441 million and 408 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in cash flows used in financing activities between periods was primarily due to the issuance of the 2032 Notes of 600 million and lower net repayments on our Credit Facility of 15 million, partially offset by our repurchases and redemption of the 2026 Notes of 561 million, deferred financing costs payments on our 2032 Senior Notes and New Credit Facility of 13 million and higher tax withholdings for the settlement of equity-based compensation awards of 6 million between periods.

 2024 Capital Investment On February 14, 2024, we announced a capital budget with a range of 150 million to 170 million. This capital budget supports Antero Resources maintenance capital program for 2024. Our capital budget may be adjusted as business conditions warrant. Additionally, we monitor our existing assets and look for opportunities to reuse or otherwise repurpose assets in an effort to optimize our capital efficiency. Our capital expenditures were as follows:

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on our debt agreements. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of recently adopted accounting standards have been included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Accounting estimates and assumptions are considered to be critical if there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Form 10-K for information on our critical accounting estimates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward- looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Commodity Price Risk Our gathering and compression and water services agreements with Antero Resources provide for fixed-fee and cost of service fee structures, and we intend to continue to pursue additional fixed- fee or cost of service fee opportunities with Antero Resources and third parties in order to avoid direct commodity price exposure. However, to the extent that our future contractual arrangements with Antero Resources or third parties do not provide for fixed- fee or cost of service fee structures, we may become subject to commodity price risk. We are subject to commodity price risks to the extent that they impact Antero Resources development program and production and therefore our gathering, compression, and water handling volumes. We cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by lower commodity prices and any resulting impact on Antero Resources operations.

 Interest Rate Risk Our primary exposure to interest rate risk results from outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, which has a floating interest rate. We do not currently, but may in the future, hedge the interest on portions of our borrowings under the Credit Facility from time-to- time in order to manage risks associated with floating interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had 540 million of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the New Credit Facility. A 1.0 increase in the Credit Facility interest rate would have resulted in an estimated 3 million increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Credit Risk We are dependent on Antero Resources as our primary customer, and we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from Antero Resources for the foreseeable future. As a result, any event, whether in our area of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects Antero Resources production, drilling schedule, financial condition, leverage, market reputation, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Further, we are subject to the risk of non-payment or non- performance by Antero Resources, including with respect to our gathering and compression and water handling services agreements. We cannot predict the extent to which Antero Resources business would be impacted if conditions in the energy industry were to deteriorate, nor can we estimate the impact such conditions would have on Antero Resources ability to execute its drilling and development program or to perform under our agreements. Any material non-payment or non-performance by Antero Resources could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and our ability to return capital to stockholders. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATIO N Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Our operations are subject to a variety of risks and disputes normally incident to our business. As a result, we may, at any given time, be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we, with the advice of our insurance advisors and brokers, believe are reasonable and prudent. We cannot, however, assure you that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices. See Note 14 Contingencies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Item 1A. Risk Factors. We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risks described in such report. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us. Furthermore, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table sets forth our common stock share purchase activity for each period presented: 

Approximate Total Number of Dollar Value of Total Number Average Price Shares Purchased Shares that May of Shares Paid per as Part of Publicly Yet be Purchased Period Purchased (1) Share Announced Plans Under the Plan (2) July 1, 2024 July 31, 2024 25,018 14.62 500,000,000 August 1, 2024 August 31, 2024 500,000,000 September 1, 2024 September 30, 2024 500,000,000 Total 25,018 14.62 

 (1) The total number of shares purchased represents shares of our common stock transferred to us in order to satisfy tax withholding obligations incurred upon the vesting of equity-based awards held by our employees. (2) In February 2024, the Board authorized a 500 million share repurchase program. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not make any repurchases under this program. 
 . . On October 30, 2024, the Company announced that the Board, upon the recommendation of its Nominating Governance Committee, appointed Jeffrey S. Mu oz to the Board as a Class II director. Mr. Mu oz was also appointed to serve on the Board s Audit Committee, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee and Nominating Governance Committee. The Board determined that Mr. Mu oz meets the independence requirements under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the Company s independence standards, and that there are no transactions between the Company and Mr. Mu oz that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. There are no understandings or arrangements between Mr. Mu oz and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Mu oz was selected to serve as a director of the Board. In addition, the Board determined that Mr. Mu oz qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC. Mr. Mu oz will receive the standard non-employee director compensation for serving on the Board and committees of the Board. The specific terms of such compensation are described further in the Company s annual proxy statement that was filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024.
