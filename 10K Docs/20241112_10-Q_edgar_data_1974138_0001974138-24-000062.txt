 Amended Credit Agreement 
 On October 17, 2024 , Atleos entered into the First Amendment (the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2023, by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent (the Credit Agreement and, as amended by the First Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement ). The First Amendment provides for (a) an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit commitments equal to million such that the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitments after giving effect to this First Amendment will be million Revolving Credit Loans and (b) a new class of incremental term loan commitments (the Term A-2 Commitments and, the loans made pursuant thereto, the Term A-2 Loans to be established in an aggregate principal amount equal to million. 
 The proceeds of the Term A-2 Loans were used to, among other things, (i) prepay a portion of the Term Loan B Facility outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Amended Credit Agreement (the Existing Term B Loans ), (ii) to pay the call premium, fees, costs and expenses related to the foregoing transactions, and (iii) for general corporate purposes. Immediately following the prepayment described in clause (i) above, the Existing Term B Loans were refinanced and replaced in their entirety with a new tranche of term loans under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount equal to million (the New Term B Loans ). 
 The existing senior secured Term Loan A Facility (the Term A-1 Loans ), the Term A-2 Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans will bear interest based on the secured overnight financing rate SOFR (or an alternative reference rate for amounts denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars), or, at the Company s option, in the case of amounts denominated in U.S. Dollars, at a base reference rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus , (b) the rate of interest last quoted by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate and (c) the one-month SOFR rate plus ,

 (the Base Rate ), plus, as applicable, a margin ranging from to per annum for SOFR-based Term A-1 Loans, Term A-2 Loans and Revolving Credit Loans and ranging from to per annum for Base Rate-based Term A-1 Loans, Term A-2 Loans and Revolving Credit Loans, in each case, depending on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio. 
 The New Term B Loans will bear interest at SOFR or, at the Company s option, the Base Rate, plus, as applicable, a margin of per annum for SOFR-based Term B Loans and for Base Rate-based Term B Loans. 
 The Term A-2 Loans will mature on October 16, 2028, coterminous with the Revolving Credit Loans and the Term A-1 Loans. The New Term B Loans will mature on April 16, 2029. 
 
 Prior Period Financial Statement Revision In connection with the preparation of the Company s second quarter 2024 financial statements, management identified errors pertaining to the Separation-related accounting entries recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, which impacted the December 31, 2023 balance sheet and statement of changes in stockholders equity. Some of these errors were previously recorded out-of-period in the first quarter of 2024. In order to correctly state December 31, 2023 equity to reflect the impact of the spin-off transaction, which involved a net distribution payment of million to Voyix in consideration for the net assets contributed to Atleos, management has revised the December 31, 2023 balance sheet and statement of changes in stockholders equity to reflect the impact of the errors, including those previously recorded in the first quarter of 2024. This also results in a revision to the statement of changes in stockholders equity for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The adjustments have no impact on operating results or cash flows. The Company evaluated the impact of the adjustments and concluded they were not material to any previously issued interim or annual consolidated financial statements. The accompanying footnotes have also been adjusted to reflect such correction. The Company will effect the revision of its consolidated financial statements as of the year ended December 31, 2023 when it files its Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2024.

 As it relates to the statement of changes in stockholders equity for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the revision adjustment removes the million decrease to retained earnings recorded on the line Net transfers to Voyix, including Separation adjustments. The revision adjustment further reflects the impact of an incremental million adjustment to Paid-in capital on the line Stock compensation plans.

 million and million, respectively. We continue to evaluate our reserves in light of the age and quality of our outstanding accounts receivable as well as risks to specific industries or countries and adjust the reserves accordingly. The impact to our allowance for credit lo sses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial. The Company recorded immaterial write-offs against the reserve for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 includes approximately million related to other accounts receivable balances not transferred to Atleos as of December 31, 2023 due to delays in local processes of setting up certain Atleos legal entities. These entities were legally transferred to the Company during the first quarter of 2024. As such, the allowance for credit losses associated with these transferred entities were recorded in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2024. Prior to the Separation, this amount was included within Atleos allowance for credit losses under carve-out methodology.

Self Service Banking (1) 
 Total goodwill 
 (1) The carrying amount of goodwill for the Self-Service Banking segment is presented net of accumulated impairment losses of million as of each period end. 
 Based on the annual goodwill impairment test completed during 2023, the Company determined the fair value of all reporting units was greater than their carrying value. However, as of the date of the previous annual assessment, the Network reporting unit had fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 10 . Accordingly, it was previously disclosed that this reporting unit has a heightened risk of impairment if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors changed in the future. We have considered potential impairment triggering events in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and did not identify any such matters warranting additional evaluation.

 Under the Trade Receivables Facility, the Company and certain United States and Canadian operating subsidiaries of the Company continuously sell their trade receivables as they are originated to the U.S. SPE and a Canadian SPE (collectively, the SPEs ), as applicable. No assets or credit of either SPE is available to satisfy the debts and obligations owed to the creditors of the Company or any other person until the obligations of the SPEs under the Trade Receivables Facility have been satisfied. The Company controls, and therefore consolidates, the SPEs in its Condensed Consolidated Financial statements. 
 As cash is collected on the trade receivables, the U.S. SPE has the ability to continuously transfer ownership and control of new qualifying receivables to the Purchasers such that the total outstanding balance of trade receivables sold can be up to million at any point in time (i.e., the maximum purchase commitment). The future outstanding balance of trade receivables that are sold is expected to vary based on the level of activity and other factors and could be less than the maximum purchase commitment. The total outstanding balance of trade receivables that have been sold and derecognized by the U.S. SPE was approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Excluding the trade receivables sold, the SPEs collectively owned million and million of trade receivables as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Accounts receivable, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Continuous cash activity related to the Trade Receivables Facility is reflected in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The U.S. SPE incurs fees due and payable to the Purchasers. Those fees, which are immaterial, are recorded within Other (expense) income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, each of the SPEs has provided a full recourse guarantee in favor of the Purchasers of the full and timely payment of all trade receivables sold to them by the U.S. SPE. The guarantee is collateralized by all the trade receivables owned by each of the SPEs that have not been sold. The reserve recognized for this recourse obligation as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is not material. 
 Cardtronics USA Inc. and Cardtronics Canada Holdings Inc. continue to be involved with the trade receivables even after they are transferred to the SPEs (or further transferred to the Purchasers) by acting as a servicer. In addition to any obligations as servicer, the U.S. Originators and Canadian Originator provide the SPEs with customary recourse in respect of (i) certain dilutive events with respect to the trade receivables sold to the SPEs that are caused by the originator and (ii) in the event of certain violations by the originator of their representations and warranties with respect to the trade receivables sold to the SPEs. These servicing and originator liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than the SPEs) under the Trade Receivables Facility are not expected to be material, given the high quality of the customers underlying the receivables and the anticipated short collection period. 
 The Trade Receivables Facility includes other customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and default and termination provisions, which provide for the acceleration of amounts owed to the Purchasers thereunder in circumstances including, but not limited to, failure to pay capital or yield when due, breach of representation, warranty or covenant, certain insolvency events or failure to maintain the security interest in the trade receivables, and defaults under other material indebtedness.

 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by lower income before taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period and discrete tax expenses recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did recognize any material discrete tax expenses or benefits. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed certain internal restructuring transactions in connection with the Spin-off, resulting in a net of million discrete tax expenses. Approximately million of the discrete tax expense was for non-cash deferred tax items, primarily related to the tax effects upon the transfer of certain intangible assets among the wholly-owned subsidiaries prior to the Spin-off. 

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by lower income before taxes and discrete tax benefits and expenses realized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a million benefit related to provision to return adjustments. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed certain internal restructuring transactions in connection with the Spin-off, resulting in a net of million discrete tax expenses. Approximately million of the discrete tax expense was for non-cash deferred tax items, primarily related to the tax effects upon the transfer of certain intangible assets among the wholly-owned subsidiaries prior to the Spin-off.

 Total stock-based compensation expense, presented in the table above for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is specifically for employees who exclusively supported Atleos operations. Total stock-based compensation expense allocated to Atleos for corporate and shared employees was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 On February 16, 2024, the Company granted restricted stock units under the 2023 Stock Incentive Plan to its executive officers and other employees, comprised of both time-based and market-based restricted stock units. The time-based restricted stock units were granted with a weighted-average grant date fair value of and vest in annual installments over a requisite service period ending February 16, 2027.

 and of the target units granted based on the Company s relative total shareholder return from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 (the performance period ), as compared to a designated peer group. The fair value of the awards was determined to be per share based on using a Monte-Carlo simulation model and will be recognized over a requisite service period ending February 16, 2027. 
 
 Both time-based and market-based restricted stock units granted to executive officers are subject to a mandatory post-vesting holding period. As such, a discount for lack of marketability was calculated using the Finnerty model and applied to the awards subject to the post-vesting restrictions. The fair value of the time-based and market-based awards subject to the post-vesting restrictions were and , respectively. 
 
 Risk-free interest rate Expected volatility Discount for lack of marketability 
 
 Expected volatility for these restricted stock units is calculated as the historical volatility of the Company s peers over a period of approximately , as management believes this is the best representation of prospective trends given the limited trading history of Atleos stock. The risk-free interest rate was determined based on a three-year U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The dividend yield was based on the Company s estimated annual dividend payment and stock price. The discount for lack of marketability was based on a Finnerty put-option model, which uses the price of a put to estimate the cost of insuring the value of the award against downside risk during the holding period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock grants is million. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years. 
 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In October 2023, the Board of Directors adopted the NCR Atleos Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective October 18, 2023. The total number of shares of the Company s common stock reserved for future issuance at inception was million. The Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP provides employees up to a discount on stock purchases using a look-back feature where the discount is applied to the stock price that represents the lower of Atleos closing stock price on either the first day or the last day of each calendar quarter. Participants can contribute between and of their compensation.

 of certain shared environmental liabilities arising from conduct prior to the Distribution if Voyix s annual costs, net of any insurance proceeds and third-party payments actually received, exceed million, of all liabilities of a divested or discontinued business that was divested or discontinued prior to the Distribution and liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from any registration statement or similar disclosure document related to the Separation (including the Company s Registration Statement on Form 10 initially filed with the SEC on June 26, 2023, and as further amended thereafter and declared effective on August 11, 2023, and the information statement). Voyix will retain all other liabilities, including, among others, of all liabilities of a divested or discontinued business that was divested or discontinued prior to the Distribution, the first million of annual costs incurred in connection with certain shared environmental liabilities arising from conduct prior to the Distribution and of any such costs thereafter and all indemnification obligations to current and former Voyix directors and officers. 
 Shared Environmental Matters 
 As described above, the Company shares liability with Voyix for certain investigatory and remedial activities, and related litigation, at formerly owned or operated facilities, to comply, or to determine compliance, with environmental laws (the Shared Environmental Matters ). Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company and Voyix share equally costs and liabilities with respect to the Shared Environmental Matters to the extent Voyix s annual costs, net of any insurance proceeds and third-party payments actually received, exceed million. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Voyix will notify the Company by December 1 each calendar year of the estimated costs for the Shared Environmental Matters it will incur each quarter of the following calendar year pursuant to which the Company will make quarterly payments to Voyix of any required contribution. The Company s payments are subject to upward or downward adjustment after Voyix provides a final quarterly accounting of the actual costs. As of September 30, 2024, Voyix estimated that the Company s contribution for Shared Environmental Matters in 2024 will be approximately million, to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company evaluated the estimate in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies , and concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, a loss of up to million is probable and, therefore, recorded an accrual for this amount. 
 Other than the cost reporting described above, Voyix is only required to update the Company from time to time with respect to any events in connection with [the Shared Environmental Matters] at such times and in such manner as [Voyix] shall reasonably determine. The term of this cost sharing is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses. Voyix controls exclusively the management of the Shared Environmental Matters, including any litigation related thereto, which could impact the amounts that the Company is required to contribute for the Shared Environmental Matters under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

 share of past costs, to pay the USEPA and state agencies their past and future administrative costs, and to dismiss a pending appeal. The Consent Decree further requires Voyix to take responsibility for the remediation of a portion, but not all, of the Kalamazoo River. The Consent Decree further provides Voyix protection from other potentially responsible parties, including GP, seeking contribution for their costs associated with the clean-up anywhere on the river, thereby resolving the allocation of future costs left unresolved by prior litigation. 
 Voyix reports that it believes it has meritorious claims against Kalamazoo River co-obligor B.A.T. Industries p.l.c. BAT under a prior settlement agreement with that company for the Kalamazoo River remediation expenses as a so-called future site. To date, BAT has denied that the Kalamazoo River is a future site. On February 10, 2023, Voyix filed an action against BAT in the Southern District of New York seeking a declaration that the Kalamazoo River is indeed a future site under their agreement. Voyix also reports that it will have indemnity or reimbursement claims against AT T Corp and Nokia (as the successor to Lucent Technologies and Alcatel-Lucent USA) under a 1996 Divestiture Agreement after expenses have met a contractual threshold. Voyix believes that contractual threshold was, or was nearly, met in December 2022. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Voyix will continue to control any actions to collect the unpaid sums. 
 Voyix further reports that as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Voyix s total reserve for Kalamazoo River was million and million, respectively. The reserve is reported on a basis that is net of expected contributions from Voyix s co-obligors and indemnitors, subject to when the applicable threshold is reached. 
 As many aspects of the costs of remediation will not be determined for several years (and thus the high end of a range of possible costs for many areas of the site cannot be quantified at this time), Voyix reports that it has made what it considers to be reasonable estimates of the low end of a range for such costs where remedies are identified, and/or of the costs of investigations and studies for areas of the river where remedies have not yet been determined, and the reserve is informed by those estimates. The extent of Voyix s and, therefore, the Company s, potential liability remains subject to many uncertainties, notwithstanding the settlement of this matter and the related Consent Decree noted above, particularly in as much as remedy decisions and cost estimates will not be generated until times in the future and as most of the work to be performed will take place through the 2030s. 
 Environmental-Related Insurance Recoveries 
 Historically, Voyix has received payments from its insurance carriers with respect to the Shared Environmental Matters. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, insurance amounts actually recovered will, as a result of reducing Voyix s overall liability, reduce the Company s liability in its obligation to contribute for the Shared Environmental Matters. The Company does not anticipate that Voyix will obtain further material insurance recoveries specific to Kalamazoo River remediation costs. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, control of claims against insurers with respect to the Shared Environmental Matters is controlled exclusively by Voyix, as well as whether or not any coverage is in fact available, and the Company is unable to predict whether and to what extent insurance proceeds will be available to offset any amounts it may be required to pay in respect of the foregoing environmental matters pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. 
 Environmental Remediation Estimates 
 It is difficult to estimate the future financial impact of environmental laws, including potential liabilities. We record environmental provisions when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount or range of the liability is reasonably estimable; in accordance with accounting guidance, where liabilities are not expected to be quantifiable or estimable for a period of years, the estimated costs of investigating those liabilities are recorded as a component of the reserve for that particular site. Provisions for estimated losses from environmental restoration and remediation are, depending on the site, based generally on internal and third-party environmental studies, estimates as to the number and participation level of other potentially responsible parties, the extent of contamination, estimated amounts for attorney and

 million supersedeas bond, which Voyix contends may not be correlated to any actual loss but allowed Voyix to obtain a stay of execution of the judgment pending appeal. On September 12, 2024, the bond was filed and the stay was issued. The appeal remains pending. The Company evaluated the judgment and order and, after consulting with Voyix, in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies , concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, a loss is reasonably possible, but that an estimate or range of possible loss cannot be determined at this time given uncertainty regarding the ultimate form of relief and complexities in the methodology and quantification of damages, if any.

 functional currencies. Our results can be significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company seeks to mitigate such impact by hedging its foreign currency transaction exposure using foreign currency contracts. We do not enter into hedges for speculative purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company designates foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions when they are determined to be highly effective at inception. 
 Our risk management strategy includes hedging, on behalf of certain subsidiaries, a portion of our forecasted, non-functional currency denominated cash flows for a period of up to months. As a result, some of the impact of currency fluctuations on non-functional currency denominated transactions (and hence on subsidiary operating income, as stated in the functional currency), is mitigated in the near term. In the longer term (greater than months), the subsidiaries are still subject to the effect of translating the functional currency results to United States Dollars. To manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, we hedge our main transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange contracts. This is primarily done through the hedging of foreign currency denominated intercompany inventory purchases by Atleos marketing units and the foreign currency denominated inputs to our manufacturing units. If the hedge is designated as a highly effective cash flow hedge, the gains or losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI ). The gains or losses from derivative contracts that are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges related to inventory purchases are recorded in cost of products when the inventory is sold to an unrelated third party. Otherwise, they are recorded in earnings when the exchange rates change. As of September 30, 2024, the balance in AOCI related to foreign exchange derivative transactions was because no such derivatives were designated as highly effective hedges. 
 We also utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure of assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. We recognize the gains and losses on these types of hedges in earnings as exchange rates change. 
 Interest Rate Risk The Company designates Interest Rate Derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions when they are determined to be highly effective at inception. 
 We utilize interest rate swap contracts to add stability to interest cost and to manage exposure to interest rate movements as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Payments and receipts related to interest rate derivative agreements are included in Operating Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 In June 2023, the Company executed billion aggregate notional amount interest rate swap contracts effective June 14, 2023 and terminating on December 31, 2025. These interest rate swap contracts had fixed rates ranging from to , and were designated as cash flow hedges of the floating rate interest associated with the Company s U.S. Dollar and U.K. Pound Sterling vault cash agreements. In March 2024, the Company terminated all open U.S. Dollar interest rate swap contracts for cash proceeds of million. The net derivative-related gains associated with these swaps will be reclassified into earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive income through December 31, 2025, corresponding to the term of the original interest rate swap agreements. 
 Effective March 19, 2024, the Company executed billion aggregate notional amount interest rate swap contracts terminating on March 31, 2027. These interest rate swap contracts have fixed rates ranging from to , and have been designated as cash flow hedges of the floating rate interest associated with the Company s U.S. Dollar vault cash agreements.

These interest rate swap contracts have fixed rates ranging from to , and have been designated as cash flow hedges of the floating rate interest associated with the Company s U.S. Dollar vault cash agreements. 
 Effective August 13, 2024, the Company executed million aggregate notional amount interest rate swap contracts terminating on December 31, 2027. These interest rate swap contracts have fixed rates ranging from to , and have been designated as cash flow hedges of the floating rate interest associated with the Company s Term Loan Facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, each of our outstanding Interest Rate Derivative agreements were determined to be highly effective. Amounts reported in AOCI related to these derivatives will be reclassified to Cost of services and Interest expense as payments are made on the Company s vault cash rental obligations and Term Loan Facilities, respectively. Unrealized gains on terminated interest rate swap agreements reported in AOCI will be reclassified to Cost of services ratably over terms corresponding to the original agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance in AOCI related to Interest Rate Derivatives was an accumulated loss of million and income of million, respectively.

 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 Atleos is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments and cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties. The maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals, credit limits, selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures. Atleos business often involves large transactions with customers, and if one or more of those customers were to default on its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements, the Company could be exposed to potentially significant losses. However, management believes that the reserves for potential losses are adequate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Atleos did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments.

 Deposits Held in Money Market Mutual Funds A portion of the Company s excess cash is held in money market mutual funds that generate interest income based on prevailing market rates. Money market mutual fund holdings are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Foreign Exchange Contracts As a result of our global operating activities, we are exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our financial condition. To manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results, we hedge our primary transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange contracts. The foreign exchange contracts are valued using the market approach based on observable market transactions of forward rates and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Interest Rate Swap In order to add stability to operating costs and to manage exposure to interest rate movements, the Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The interest rate swap contracts are valued using an income model based on disparity between variable and fixed interest rates, the scheduled balance of underlying principal outstanding, yield curves, and other information readily available in the market. As such, the interest rate swap contracts are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements. We

 SPIN-OFF FROM NCR 
 On October 16, 2023, NCR Corporation (now known as NCR Voyix Corporation or Voyix, and referred to as NCR when discussing periods prior to the Separation), completed a Spin-off to NCR shareholders of its self-service banking, network, and telecommunications and technology businesses (the Spin-off or Separation ). Concurrent with the Spin-off, the Company became a stand-alone publicly-traded company and its financial statements are now presented on a consolidated basis. Prior to the Separation, the Company s historical combined financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from NCR s consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The financial statements for all periods presented, including the historical results of the Company prior to October 16, 2023, are now referred to as Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 
 In connection with the Spin-off, we have incurred and expect to incur in the future one-time separation costs, which include one-time and non-recurring expenses associated with the Spin-off and stand up of functions required to operate as a stand-alone public entity. These non-recurring costs primarily relate to system implementation costs, business and facilities separation, applicable employee related costs, development of our brand and other matters. We expect the separation-related costs will continue through at least fiscal year 2024. 
 In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and various other agreements with Voyix. These agreements provide a framework for our relationship with Voyix and govern various interim and ongoing relationships between Atleos and Voyix. These agreements with Voyix are described in the section of the Information Statement titled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions-Agreements with NCR. Following the Separation, certain functions continue to be provided by or for Voyix under the Transition Services Agreements or are being performed using Atleos own resources or third-party service providers. Additionally, certain maintenance services, manufacturing services, product resale and other support services and supply chain operations will continue to be provided by or to Voyix under the Commercial Agreements. On August 6, 2024, Voyix announced its intention to move the manufacturing services to another party and to further reduce the maintenance services that are being performed under the Commercial Agreements. 
 
 STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND TRENDS 
 Atleos is expected to be a cash-generative business positioned to focus on delivering ATM as a Service to a large, installed customer base across banks and retailers. We believe it will build on our leadership in self-service banking and ATM networks to meet global demand for ATM access and leverage new ATM transaction types, including digital currency solutions, to drive market growth. Atleos is expected to also continue shifting to a highly recurring revenue model to drive stable cash flow and capital returns to shareholders. 
 We are continuing our transition to software-led solutions. Today, our software platform, which runs in the cloud and includes microservices and application programming interfaces APIs that integrate with our customers systems, and our ATM as a Service solutions, bring together all our capabilities and competencies to power the technology to run our customers self-directed banking networks, at the same time allowing us to earn a greater proportion of recurring revenues. 
 We have grown organically, as well as through acquisitions, to add software, services and other capabilities that complement or enhance our existing portfolio. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Cardtronics plc Cardtronics to accelerate our ATM as a Service strategy, adding the Allpoint network to our suite of financial institution and retailer-focused payment technologies. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to win new customers, expand our footprint and drive more transactions and foot traffic for our customers. 
 We also plan to continue to improve our execution to drive solid returns and to transform our business to enhance value for all shareholders.

 Cybersecurity Risk Management 
 Similar to most companies, Atleos and its customers are subject to more frequent and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. Atleos maintains cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures, which it regularly evaluates for updates, for handling and responding to cybersecurity events. For additional information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance, see Item 1C. Cybersecurity, in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 As of the date of this report, the Company has not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably anticipated to have a material effect on the organization. Although the Company has not experienced cybersecurity incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, the Company has experienced cyberattacks in the past, which the Company believes have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures put in place by the Company. For a detailed discussion of the Company s cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Data protection, cybersecurity and data privacy issues could adversely impact our business in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Impacts from Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Challenges 
 We continue to be exposed to macroeconomic pressures such as higher interest rates, increased logistics costs, and foreign currency fluctuations as a result of geopolitical challenges, including those due to various conflicts in and around the Red Sea. We continue to navigate through these challenges with a sharp focus on and goal of safeguarding our employees, helping our customers and managing impacts to the business. Despite the rapidly changing environment, our teams are executing at a high level and we are advancing our strategy. 
 The bank failures in 2023 and 2024, in addition to other global macroeconomic conditions, have caused a degree of uncertainty in the investor community and among bank customers, and could significantly impact the national, regional and local banking industry and the global business environment in which Atleos operates. The Company does not believe that the circumstances of these bank failures are indicators of broader issues within the banking system. However, if there is a severe or prolonged economic downturn, it could result in a variety of risks to our business, including driving banking customers to tighten budgets and curtail spending, which would negatively impact our sales and business. 
 We expect that these factors may continue to negatively impact our business at least in the short-term. The ultimate impact on our overall financial condition and operating results will depend on the duration and severity of these geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures and any governmental and public actions taken in response. We continue to evaluate the long-term impact that these may have on our business model, however, there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or will take will completely offset the negative impact. 
 For further information on the risks posed to our business from geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , of our 2023 Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled, A major natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or have other adverse consequences. For further information on exposures to interest rate and foreign exchange risk, refer to Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , in this Form 10-Q. 
 Impacts from Seasonality and Tourism 
 Our business is generally seasonal, with lower revenue and fewer transactions occurring in the first quarter of each year. Transaction volumes at our ATMs located in regions affected by strong winter weather patterns typically experience declines in volume during winter months due to decreases in the amount of consumer traffic through such locations. We usually have an increase in transaction volume during the warmer summer months, aided by increased vacation and holiday travel. Such seasonality causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on variability in the volume, timing and mix of sales. We expect the fluctuations in transaction volume to continue. For further information on the seasonality of our business, refer to Part I, Item 1 Business - Seasonality , of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Use of Certain Terms: 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA Atleos management uses the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA because it provides useful information to investors as an indicator of performance of the Company s ongoing business operations. Atleos determines Adjusted EBITDA based on GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to Atleos plus interest expense, net; plus income tax expense (benefit); plus depreciation and amortization; plus acquisition-related costs; plus pension mark-to-market adjustments, pension settlements, pension curtailments and pension special termination benefits; plus separation-related costs; plus transformation and restructuring charges (which includes integration, severance and other exit and disposal costs); plus stock-based compensation expense; plus Voyix legal and environmental indemnification expense; plus other special (expense) income items. These adjustments are considered non-operational or non-recurring in nature and are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA metric utilized by our chief operating decision maker CODM in evaluating segment performance and are separately delineated to reconcile back to total reported income attributable to Atleos. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends. It also includes the same information that is used by Atleos management to make decisions regarding our segments and to assess our financial performance. Refer to the table below for the reconciliations of Net income (loss) attributable to Atleos (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP). 
 
 Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP), Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) and Adjusted research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) . Atleos Adjusted gross margin rate (non-GAAP), Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) and Adjusted research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) are determined by excluding, as applicable: acquisition-related costs; pension settlements, pension curtailments and pension special termination benefits; separation-related costs; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; stock-based compensation expense; transformation and restructuring charges (which includes integration, severance and other exit and disposal costs); and other special (expense) income items from Atleos GAAP gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses, respectively. Due to the nature of these special items, Atleos management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate year-over-year operating performance. Atleos believes these measures are useful for investors because they may provide a more complete understanding of Atleos underlying operational performance, as well as consistency and comparability with Atleos past reports of financial results. 
 Atleos definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures reported by other companies and cannot, therefore, be compared with similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Use of Certain Terms 
 Recurring revenue All revenue streams from contracts where there is a predictable revenue pattern that will occur at regular intervals with a relatively high degree of certainty. This includes hardware and software maintenance revenue, processing revenue, interchange and network revenue, Bitcoin-related revenue, and certain professional services arrangements, as well as term-based software license arrangements that include customer termination rights. 
 Annualized Recurring Revenue ARR ). Recurring revenue, excluding software licenses sold as a subscription, for the last three months times four, plus the rolling four quarters for term-based software license arrangements that include customer termination rights. Atleos believes this metric may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company s achievement of strategic goals related to the conversion of the self-service banking business to recurring revenue streams over time. ARR is an operating metric and does not necessarily reflect the pattern of revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for GAAP revenue. ARR does not have a uniform definition and, therefore, Atleos definitions may differ from other companies definitions of this measure. 
 
 ATM as a Service Units. The number of ATMs as of period end that are deployed under our ATM as a Service offering. ATM as a Service refers to our turnkey, end-to-end ATM platform solution, whereby we provide comprehensive managed services solutions to financial institutions. Atleos believes this metric may be useful to investors in measuring the Company s achievement of strategic goals related to growth of the ATM as a Service business over time. 
 
 Last twelve months average revenue per unit LTM ARPU ). For the Network segment, total segment revenue for the previous twelve months divided by the average Network Managed Units for the previous twelve months. Atleos believes 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 this metric may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company s achievement of strategic goals related to the improved monetization of our ATM fleet over a specified period, excluding the impact of seasonality. LTM ARPU is an operating metric and does not represent revenue generated solely by our Network Managed Units, as total Network segment revenue includes revenue generated from other sources besides the Network Managed Units. LTM ARPU does not have a uniform definition and, therefore, Atleos definitions may differ from other companies definitions of this measure. 
 
 Network Managed Units. All transacting ATMs as of period end, whether Company-owned or Merchant-owned, other than those for which we only provide third party processing services and those under legacy managed services arrangements. This metric is used in the calculation of Network segment LTM ARPU.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by the delayed transfer of seven legal entities to Atleos following our separation from Voyix, due to local processes of setting up Atleos legal entities. Prior to the Separation, the operating results of each of these entities were included within Atleos results under carve-out methodology as all entities were dedicated to the Atleos business. Of these seven entities, three transferred during the first quarter of 2024 and two entities transferred in the second quarter of 2024. The remaining two entities are expected to transfer in the fourth quarter of 2024. We estimate the delayed transfer of these entities resulted in an approximately 3 million and 22 million decline in revenue for the three and nine months ended 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period. 
 Total revenue increased 1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the growth of recurring service revenue streams in our core business as well as revenues recognized pursuant to our commercial agreements with Voyix. 
 Product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 7 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to declines in non-core commerce-related revenue of approximately 6 million related to the wind down of that business, ATM and other hardware revenue of approximately 11 million and Bitcoin-related revenues of approximately 9 million, partially offset by approximately 6 million of product revenues earned under the commercial agreements with Voyix and a 2 million increase in software license revenue. The decline in ATM hardware revenue is partially due to the shift in the business from one-time hardware sales to recurring ATM as a Service subscriptions as well as a 1 million reduction due to the delayed legal entities described above. The decline in Bitcoin-related revenue is due to a decrease in transaction volumes. 
 Services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3 compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by 5 total growth in our core self-service banking and network offerings. Services revenue benefited from increases of approximately 6 million of transaction processing services revenue, 9 million in ATM as a Service revenue, 5 million in hardware maintenance and installation revenue earned under the commercial agreements, and 15 million in other software-related revenues, partially offset by a decrease of 4 million in hardware maintenance and installation revenue in our core business. The increase in transaction processing services was driven by an increase in withdrawal transaction volumes and the favorable mix of payments transactions year-over-year, while the growth in ATM as a Service revenue was due to the continued growth in our ATM as a Service offering, whereby we own the ATMs and charge per ATM for the service. Included in the activity described above, the delayed transfer of legal entities resulted in a reduction of hardware maintenance and installation revenue and other software-related services revenue of approximately 1 million and 1 million, respectively. 
 
 Total revenue increased 4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the growth of recurring service revenue streams in our core business as well as revenues recognized pursuant to our commercial agreements with Voyix. 
 Product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to declines in non-core commerce related revenues of approximately 27 million related to the wind down of that business, ATM and other hardware revenue of approximately 28 million and Bitcoin-related revenues of approximately 19 million, partially offset by approximately 44 million of product revenues earned under the commercial agreements with Voyix. The decline in ATM hardware revenue is partially due to the shift in the business from one-time hardware sales to recurring ATM as a Service subscriptions as well as a 5 million reduction due to the delayed legal entities described above. The decline in Bitcoin-related revenue is due to a decrease in transaction volumes. 
 Services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by 6 total growth in our core self-service banking and network offerings. Services revenue benefited from increases of approximately 38 million of transaction processing services revenue, 37 million in hardware maintenance and installation revenue, 30 million in ATM as a Service revenue as well as 37 million in other software-related revenues. The significant increase in transaction processing services was driven by an increase in withdrawal transaction volumes and the favorable mix of payments transactions year-over-year, while the growth in ATM as a Service revenue was due to the continued growth in our ATM as a Service offering, whereby we own the ATMs and charge per ATM for the service. The increase in hardware maintenance and installation revenue was primarily due to an increase in the core business of approximately 9 million and approximately 28 million earned under the commercial agreements with Voyix. Included in the activity described above, the delayed transfer of legal entities resulted in a reduction of hardware

 G ross margin as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 24.3 compared to 25.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the impact of lower margins recognized on products and services provided under the commercial agreements with Voyix. Our services gross margin was also impacted by increased interest rates driving 4 million of higher rental cost on our vault cash agreements as well as incremental labor costs. Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 20 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, 2 million of transformation and restructuring costs, 1 million of stock-based compensation expense and 1 million of separation-related costs. Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 15 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and 5 million of stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) decreased from 27.0 to 26.5 , due to the same factors that impacted GAAP gross margin as a percentage of revenue discussed above.

 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 127 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 160 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 11.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher separation-related costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the prior year period. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses included 4 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, 5 million of transformation and restructuring costs, 7 million of stock-based compensation expense and 4 million of separation-related costs. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses included 9 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, 1 million of transformation and restructuring costs, 7 million of stock-based compensation expense and 46 million of separation-related costs. The beneficial impact of these cost changes compared to prior year was partially offset by lower costs allocated to Atleos under carve-out accounting methodologies in the prior year period, compared to operations as a stand-alone company in the three months ended September 30, 2024, which include separation cost dis-synergies and higher employee-benefit related costs. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) increased from 9.1 to 9.9 due to the differences in cost allocations, employee-benefit related costs, and separation cost dis-synergies described above.

On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD released a statement on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges of the digital economy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15 percent global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected by calendar year 2024. The estimated Pillar Two taxes do not have a material impact on the estimated annual effective tax rate for 2024 nor the income tax provision for the quarter. We are continuing to evaluate the Pillar Two Framework and its potential impact on future periods. 
 The Company is subject to numerous federal, state and foreign tax audits. While certain reserves exist for issues that might arise from these audits, should these audits be settled, the resulting tax effect could impact the tax provision and cash flows in 2024 or future periods. 
 
 Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment 
 The Company manages and reports its businesses in the following segments: Self-Service Banking, Network, and Telecommunications Technology (T T). Segments are measured for profitability by the Company s chief operating decision maker (CODM) based on revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Refer to the section above entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Use of Certain Terms for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Atleos (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP).

 Segment Revenue 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Self-Service Banking revenue increased 3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, ATM as a Service revenue increased approximately 8 million and 30 million, software-related revenue increased approximately 24 million and 51 million, hardware maintenance and installation revenue decreased 1 million and increased 12 million and ATM hardware revenue decreased 10 million and 31 million, respectively, compared to the prior year period. Revenue results for the period were primarily due to the shift from non-recurring revenues to recurring ATM as a Service arrangements whereby we own the ATMs and charge per ATM for the service, as well as the shift to recurring software subscriptions. Included in the results described above, the delayed transfer of legal entities drove a reduction of approximately 3 million and 22 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period. Software and services revenue as a percent of total Self-Service Banking segment revenue were 72 and 73 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 70 and 70 in the prior period. 
 Network revenue decreased 1 and increased 3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in revenue was due to the decrease in Bitcoin-related revenue of approximately 9 million due to decrease in transaction volumes, partially offset by a 6 million increase in transaction processing services revenue driven by an increase in higher value ATM transactions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in revenue was due to an approximately 38 million increase in transaction processing services revenue driven by an increase in higher value ATM transactions and a 4 million increase in other software-related revenue, partially offset by a decrease in Bitcoin-related revenue of approximately 19 million due to the decrease in transactions volumes. 
 T T revenue decreased 6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to a decrease in hardware maintenance and installation revenue. T T revenue was flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, due to the decrease in hardware maintenance and installation revenue offset by one-time hardware sales. 
 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA

Table of Contents 

 Self-Service Banking Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3 and 5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period due to separation dis-synergies, higher labor and employee benefit-related costs, and the impact of one-time hardware sales shifting to ATM as a Service arrangements that are amortized over the contract period, partially offset by the higher margin recurring revenue stream growth. 
 Network Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9 and increased 4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher interest rates on our vault cash agreements driving additional cost of 4 million, as well as higher cash-in transit costs driven by the higher volume of cash dispensed in the period, and an increase in employee benefit-related costs. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to increases in withdrawal transaction volumes, the mix of higher margin transaction revenue, and cost optimization initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by higher interest rates on our vault cash agreements driving additional cost of 8 million, as well as higher cash-in-transit costs driven by the higher volume of cash dispensed in the period, and an increase in employee benefit-related costs. 
 T T Adjusted EBITDA decreased 10 and increased 4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the decrease in revenue. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to one-time hardware sales and cost optimization initiatives. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 Following the Separation, our principal sources of cash are generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt. We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. 
 Atleos management uses a non-GAAP measure called Adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted to assess the financial performance and liquidity of Atleos. We define Adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, less additions to capitalized software, plus/minus the change in restricted cash settlement activity, plus/minus net reductions or reinvestment in the trade receivables facility established in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to fluctuations in the outstanding balance of receivables sold, plus/minus financing payments/receipts of owned ATM capital expenditures, plus pension contributions and settlements, and plus legal and environmental indemnification payments made to Voyix. Restricted cash settlement activity represents the net change in amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to, certain of the Company s merchant customers or third-party service providers that are pledged for a particular use or restricted to support these obligations. These amounts can fluctuate significantly period to period based on the number of days for which settlement to the merchant has not yet occurred or day of the week on which a reporting period ends. We believe Adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted information is useful for investors because it indicates the amount of cash available after these adjustments for, among other things, investments in Atleos existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, and repayment of debt obligations. Adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted does not represent the residual cash flow available, since there may be other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted does not have a uniform definition under GAAP, and therefore Atleos definition may differ from other companies definitions of this measure. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities under GAAP. 
 Summarized cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30, is as follows: 
 Nine months ended September 30 In millions 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 264 347 Net cash used in investing activities (110) (269) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (49) 2,129 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 264 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 347 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 83 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the unfavorable movement in net working capital accounts of 12 million and a decrease in non-cash charges of 82 million partially offset by an increase in net income of 11 million.

 Summary As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 395 million and our total debt was 3,067 million. Our borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility was 294 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions and the competitive environment in our industry, and is subject to the business and other risk factors described in Item 1A, of Part I of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K and Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (as applicable). If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms in the future. 
 Management believes that our cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, along with our borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of our current and long-term (i.e., beyond September 30, 2025) material cash requirements when due, including third-party debt that we incurred in connection with the Spin-off, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. We expect to utilize our cash flows to continue to invest in our business, growth strategies, people and the communities we operate in as well as to repay our indebtedness over time. 
 Material Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations 
 There have been no significant changes in our contractual and other commercial obligations as described in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. These policies require highly subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates pertain to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible assets, pension, postretirement and postemployment benefits, income taxes, and, for periods prior to the Separation, cost allocations, which are described in Item 7. of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act ). Forward-looking statements use words such as expect, anticipate, outlook, intend, plan, confident, believe, will, should, would, potential, positioning, proposed, planned, objective, likely, could, may, and words of similar meaning, as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Act. Statements that describe or relate to Atleos plans, goals, intentions, strategies, or financial outlook, and statements that do not relate to historical or current fact, are examples of forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements regarding: our expectations of demand for our solutions and execution and the impact thereof on our financial results in 2024; Atleos focus on advancing our strategic growth initiatives and software-led solutions with a higher mix of recurring revenue streams; and our expectations of Atleos ability to deliver increased value to customers and stockholders. Forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions, which may not prove to be accurate, and involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are out of Atleos control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and there are a number of important factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including those factors relating to: 
 Strategy and Technology: transforming our business model; development and introduction of new solutions; competition in the technology industry; integration of acquisitions and management of alliance activities; our multinational operations; 
 Business Operations: domestic and global economic and credit conditions; risks and uncertainties from the payments-related business and industry; disruptions in our data center hosting and public cloud facilities; retention and attraction of key employees; defects, errors, installation difficulties or development delays; failure of third-party suppliers; a major natural disaster or catastrophic event, including the impact of pandemics and, geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges; environmental exposures from historical and ongoing manufacturing activities; and climate change; 
 Data Privacy Security: impact of data protection, cybersecurity and data privacy including any related issues; 
 Finance and Accounting: our level of indebtedness; the terms governing our indebtedness; incurrence of additional debt or similar liabilities or obligations; access or renewal of financing sources; our cash flow sufficiency to service our indebtedness; interest rate risks; the terms governing our trade receivables facility; the impact of certain changes in control relating to acceleration of our indebtedness, our obligations under other financing arrangements, or required repurchase of our senior secured notes; any lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies; our pension liabilities; and write down of the value of certain significant assets; 
 Law and Compliance: allegations or claims by third parties that our products or services infringe on intellectual property rights of others, including claims against our customers and claims by our customers to defend and indemnify them with respect to such claims; protection of our intellectual property; changes to our tax rates and additional income tax liabilities; uncertainties regarding regulations, lawsuits and other related matters; and changes to cryptocurrency regulations; 
 Governance: actions or proposals from stockholders that do not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders; and 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 Separation: the failure of Atleos to achieve some or all of the expected strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected from the spin-off; that Atleos may incur material costs and expenses as a result of the spin-off; that Atleos has limited history operating as an independent, publicly-traded company, and Atleos historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company and therefore may not be a reliable indicator of its future results; Atleos obligation to indemnify NCR pursuant to the agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off (including with respect to material taxes) and the risk NCR may not fulfill any obligations to indemnify Atleos under such agreements; that under applicable tax law, Atleos may be liable for certain tax liabilities of NCR following the spin-off if NCR were to fail to pay such taxes; that agreements binding on Atleos restrict it from taking certain actions after the distribution that could adversely impact the intended U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and related transactions; potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws; the fact that Atleos may receive worse commercial terms from third-parties for services it presently receives from NCR; that after the spin-off, certain of Atleos executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous positions at NCR; potential difficulties in maintaining relationships with key personnel; that Atleos will not be able to rely on the earnings, assets or cash flow of NCR and NCR will not provide funds to finance Atleos working capital or other cash requirements. 
 
 Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Atleos may not be able to realize any of the potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities as a result of these actions, nor may shareholders achieve any particular level of stockholder returns. The separation may not enhance value for stockholders, nor may Atleos be commercially successful in the future, nor achieve any particular credit rating or financial results. Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Since a substantial portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the United States, and in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have exposure to approximately 40 functional currencies and are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales, profits and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, we are not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and our reported results of operations could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, we hedge our main transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange contracts. This is primarily done through the hedging of foreign currency denominated intercompany inventory purchases by the marketing units and the foreign currency denominated inputs to our manufacturing units. If these contracts are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges, the gains or losses are deferred into Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI ). The gains or losses from derivative contracts that are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges related to inventory purchases are recorded in cost of products when the inventory is sold to an unrelated third party. Otherwise, the gains or losses from these contracts are recognized in earnings as exchange rates change. We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet exposures. For these derivatives we recognize gains and losses in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures. 
 We utilize non-exchange traded financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, that we purchase exclusively from highly rated financial institutions. We record these contracts on our balance sheet at fair market value based upon market price quotations from the financial institutions. We do not enter into non-exchange traded contracts that require the use of fair value estimation techniques, but if we did, they could have a material impact on our financial results. 
 For purposes of analyzing potential risk, we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio related to firmly committed or forecasted transactions. The sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction. A 10 appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair value of the hedge portfolio of 11 million as of September 30, 2024 . A 10 depreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would have resulted in a corresponding increase in the fair value of the hedge portfolio of 12 million as of September 30, 2024 . The Company expects that any increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the underlying exposures being hedged. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk principally in relation to variable-rate debt. Approximately 44 of our borrowings were on a fixed rate basis as of September 30, 2024. The increase in pre-tax interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in variable interest rates would be approximately 4 million and 13 million , respectively, including the impact from outstanding interest rate swap agreements on our variable rate debt. 
 As our ATM vault cash rental expense is based on market rates of interest, it is sensitive to changes in applicable interest rates in the respective countries in which we operate. We pay a monthly fee on the average outstanding vault cash balances in our ATMs under floating rate formulas based on a spread above various interbank offered rates. The increase in vault cash rental expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in variable interest rates would be approximately 10 million, excluding the impact from outstanding interest rate swap agreements related to our vault cash. Refer to Note 12, Derivatives and Hedging Instruments , for further information on our interest rate derivative contracts in effect as of September 30, 2024. 
 We utilize interest rate swap contracts to add stability to interest cost and to manage exposure to interest rate movements as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Payments and receipts related to interest rate swap contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 12, Derivatives and Hedging Instruments , for further information on our interest rate derivative contracts in effect as of September 30, 2024.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 We are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments, such as hedging instruments and cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties. The maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet. Exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals, credit limits, selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions, and monitoring procedures. Our business often involves large transactions with customers for which we do not require collateral. If one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements, we could be exposed to potentially significant losses. Moreover, a prolonged downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to pay their obligations on a timely basis. We believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any significant concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management of the Company, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period. Based on their evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
