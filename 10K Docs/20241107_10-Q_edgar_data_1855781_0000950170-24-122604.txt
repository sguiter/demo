The Trust continuously issues common shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust Shares ). The Trust operates pursuant to its Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2024 (the Trust Agreement ). The Shares began trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the Exchange under the ticker symbol BTCO on January 11, 2024. The Trust offers Shares only to certain eligible financial institutions Authorized Participants in one or more blocks of 5,000 Shares Creation Baskets based on the quantity of bitcoin attributable to each Share of the Trust. 
 The following discussion and analysis was prepared to supplement information contained in the accompanying financial statements and is intended to explain certain items regarding the Trust's financial condition as of September 30, 2024, and its results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the period January 11, 2024 to September 30, 2024. It should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this Report. 
 Investment Objective 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the spot price of bitcoin as measured using the Lukka Prime Bitcoin Reference Rate (the Benchmark less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding bitcoin. 
 Determination of Net Asset Value 
 The Administrator calculates, and the Sponsor publishes, the Trust s Net Asset Value NAV once each business day. To calculate the NAV, the Administrator totals the current market value of bitcoin in the Trust and any other assets, and subtracts any liabilities including accrued but unpaid expenses. The Trust s NAV is an amount denominated in U.S. dollars. 
 The Administrator also determines the NAV per Share, which equals the NAV of the Trust divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share are published by the Sponsor on each day that the Exchange is open for regular trading and are posted on the Trust s website, www.invesco.com/BTCO. 
 Valuation of Bitcoin 
 The Trust applies FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , in the valuation of bitcoin held by the Trust and for financial statement purposes. The fair market value price for bitcoin reflects the price that would be received for bitcoin in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date of bitcoin on its principal market, 
 13 

generally, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. The Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) on a periodic basis to determine which market is its Principal Market for the purpose of calculating fair value for the creation of quarterly and annual financial statements. Issuer-specific events, market trends, bid/asked quotes of brokers and information providers and other data may be reviewed in the course of making a good faith determination of a security s fair value. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Sponsor is not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or are reasonably likely to result in, material changes to the Trust s liquidity and capital resources needs. 
 The Trust pays the Sponsor a unified fee of 0.25 per annum (the Sponsor Fee as compensation for services performed under the Trust Agreement. From January 9, 2024 until January 28, 2024, the Sponsor Fee was 0.39 per annum. Prior to January 9, 2024, the Sponsor Fee was 0.59 per annum. The Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor Fee. For a 6-month period beginning January 11, 2024 the Sponsor agreed to waive the entire Sponsor Fee on the first 5 billion of Trust assets. Effective July 11, 2024, this waiver expired, and the Sponsor is no longer waiving the Sponsor Fee. 
 Except for periods during which all or a portion of the Sponsor Fee was being waived, the Sponsor Fee is accrued daily and paid monthly in arrears in U.S. dollars, and is calculated by Bank of New York Mellon (the Administrator ). The Administrator calculates the Sponsor Fee on a daily basis by applying the 0.25 annualized rate to the Trust s total net assets. 
 Except as noted below, the Sponsor has agreed to pay all of the Trust s ordinary expenses out of the Sponsor s unified fee, including, but not limited to, the Trustee s fees, the fees of The Bank of New York Mellon (for its services as the Administrator, Transfer Agent, and Cash Custodian), the fees of the Bitcoin Custodian, the fees of the Execution Agent, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, legal costs and audit fees. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust s organization. 
 The Trust may incur certain extraordinary expenses that are not assumed by the Sponsor. These include, but are not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, any applicable brokerage commissions, financing fees, Bitcoin network fees and similar transaction fees, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders (including, for example, in connection with any fork of the Bitcoin blockchain), any indemnification of the Sponsor, Cash Custodian, Bitcoin Custodian, Administrator or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters. 
 To cover the Sponsor Fee, and extraordinary expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, the Sponsor or its delegate will cause the Trust (or its delegate) to instruct Galaxy Digital Funds LLC (the Execution Agent to convert bitcoin held by the Trust into U.S. dollars. The Sponsor has engaged the Execution Agent to sell bitcoin on the Trust s behalf in such circumstances. At the direction of the Trust, the Execution Agent will seek to sell bitcoin at approximately the price at which it is valued by the Trust and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, with the intention of minimizing the Trust s holdings of assets other than bitcoin. Accordingly, the amount of bitcoin to be sold may vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust s expenses and liabilities and the market price of bitcoin. The NAV of the Trust and the number of bitcoins represented by a Share will decline each time the Trust accrues the Sponsor Fee or any Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trust is not responsible for paying any costs associated with the transfer of bitcoin to or from the Trust in connection with paying the Sponsor Fee or in connection with creation and redemption transactions. 
 The Trust has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Trust s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to Shareholders. 
 Cash Flows 
 A primary cash flow activity of the Trust is to raise capital from Authorized Participants through the issuance of Shares. This cash is used to invest in bitcoin. 
 As of the date of this Report, each of ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Citadel Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs Co., Jane Street Capital LLC, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., Marex Capital Markets Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC has executed a Participant Agreement and are the only Authorized Participants.

Trust Share Price Performance 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Exchange market value of each Share increased from 59.94 per Share to 63.44 per Share. The Share price low and high for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and related change from the Share price on June 30, 2024 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 53.47 per Share (-10.80 on August 5, 2024 and a high of 68.30 per Share (+13.94 on July 22, 2024. The total return for the Trust on a market value basis was +5.84 . 
 Bitcoin posted positive performance in the third quarter of 2024. The launch of spot Ethereum ETPs in July and the kickoff of the Federal Reserve (the Fed easing cycle in September 2024 fueled more bullish sentiment for cryptocurrencies. Although bitcoin has been range-bound, it was generally trending lower since mid-March 2024 on growing economic concerns in the US and reduced risk appetite, however, Fed Chair Powell s optimistic messaging on the economy provided some relief. Another influencing factor was market expectations for a potential second term as president by former President Trump, especially prior to Vice President Harris joining the presidential race in August. In this respect, former President Trump was generally viewed as more pro-crypto and could potentially seek relaxed regulations and more innovation-focused projects. 
 For the period January 11, 2024 (Commencement of Trading) to September 30, 2024, the Exchange market value of each Share increased from 46.30 per Share to 63.44 per Share. The Share price low and high for the period ended September 30, 2024 and related change from the Share price on January 11, 2024 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 39.11 per Share (-15.54 on January 23, 2024 and a high of 73.57 per Share (+58.90 on March 13, 2024. The total return for the Trust on a market value basis was +37.02 . 
 For the period January 11, 2024 through September 30, 2024, bitcoin s spot price rallied over 35 , leading to strong gains for the Trust. The rally was initially driven by spot bitcoin ETP demand following their historic launch on January 11, 2024, improving macro sentiment supporting investor risk appetite, and the anticipation leading up to the April 2024 bitcoin halving event, which has historically provided upside potential for bitcoin. However, after hitting a record high in March 2024 of 73,000, bitcoin prices trended lower in a range for the balance of the period, waiting for a catalyst to break out. The third quarter was a positive quarter for bitcoin as the kickoff of the Fed easing cycle and market expectations for a potential second term as president by former President Trump fueled the bullish sentiment around cryptocurrencies. The launch of spot Ethereum ETPs in July may have also been a supportive catalyst.
