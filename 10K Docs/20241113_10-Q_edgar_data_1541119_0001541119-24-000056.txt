 allowance for credit losses on securities at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total securities portfolio consisted of agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds, with a total portfolio fair value of million and million, respectively. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was security in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. The unrealized losses were caused by changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities, and not related to the underlying credit of the issuers or the underlying collateral. It is expected that these securities will not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of each investment. There was no provision for credit losses recognized for investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, because the declines in fair value were not attributable to credit quality and because we do not intend, and it is not likely that we will be required, to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.

 (1) Represents the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses on January 1, 2023. Since that date, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-13, our methodology to compute our ACL has been based on a current expected credit loss methodology, rather than the previously applied incurred loss methodology. 
 Accrued interest receivable on loans receivable totaled million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the ACL. 
 The ACL is measured using the current expected credit losses CECL approach for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and for other commitments to extend credit. CECL requires the immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the estimated remaining life of the asset. The forward-looking concept of CECL requires loss estimates to consider historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We estimate the ACL using relevant information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast. The ACL is measured on a collective (segment) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Historical credit loss experience for both the Company and segment-specific peers provides the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. Segments are based upon federal call report segmentation. The reserve was applied on a loan-by-loan basis and condensed into the applicable segments reported below. The ACL is determined using quantitative and qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis utilizes macroeconomic variables to establish a quantitative relationship between economic conditions and loan performance through an economic cycle. Qualitative adjustments include but are not limited to changes in lending policies; changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; change in staff experience level; changes in the volume or trends of classified loans, delinquencies, and nonaccrual loans; concentration risk; value of underlying collateral; competitive, legal, and regulatory factors; changes in the loan review system; and economic conditions. We evaluate our ACL policy and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. See Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the Company s ACL accounting policy.

 Generally, any significant increases in the prepayment speed assumption and discount rate utilized in the fair value measurement of the MSRs will result in a negative fair value adjustment (and decrease in the fair value measurement). Conversely, a significant decrease in the prepayment speed assumption and discount rate will result in a positive fair value adjustment (and increase in the fair value measurement). An increase in the weighted average life assumptions will result in a decrease in the prepayment speed assumption and conversely, a decrease in the weighted average life assumptions will result in an increase in the prepayment speed assumption. As a result of the difficulty in observing certain significant valuation inputs affecting our Level 3 fair value assets, we are required to make judgments regarding these items fair values. 
 There were no assets or liabilities (excluding MSRs) measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on a recurring basis during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 General 
 Sound Financial Bancorp, a Maryland corporation, is a bank holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Sound Community Bank. Substantially all of Sound Financial Bancorp s business is conducted through Sound Community Bank, a Washington state-chartered commercial bank. As a Washington commercial bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank s regulators are the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ). As a bank holding company, Sound Financial Bancorp is regulated by the Federal Reserve. We also sell insurance products and services through Sound Community Insurance Agency, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. 
 Sound Community Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. At September 30, 2024, Sound Financial Bancorp, on a consolidated basis, had assets of 1.10 billion, net loans held-for-portfolio of 893.1 million, deposits of 930.2 million and stockholders equity of 102.2 million. The common stock of Sound Financial Bancorp is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol SFBC. Our executive offices are located at 2400 3rd Avenue, Suite 150, Seattle, Washington, 98121. 
 Our principal business consists of attracting retail and commercial deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences (including home equity loans and lines of credit), commercial and multifamily real estate, construction and land, and consumer and commercial business loans. Our commercial business loans include unsecured lines of credit and secured term loans and lines of credit secured by inventory, equipment and accounts receivable. We also offer a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loan products, including manufactured home loans, floating home loans, automobile loans, boat loans and recreational vehicle loans. As part of our business, we focus on residential mortgage loan originations, a portion of which we sell to Fannie Mae and other investors and the remainder of which we retain for our loan portfolio consistent with our asset/liability objectives. We sell loans which conform to the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae conforming in which we retain the servicing of the loan in order to maintain the direct customer relationship and to generate noninterest income. Residential loans which do not conform to the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae non-conforming are either held in our loan portfolio or sold with servicing released. We originate and retain a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, including those secured by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied commercial real estate, multifamily properties and mobile home parks, and construction and land development loans. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Certain of our accounting policies require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of 
 34 

borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting estimates include determining the allowance for credit losses and accounting for mortgage servicing rights. There have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 General. Total assets increased 105.7 million, or 10.6 , to 1.10 billion at September 30, 2024 from 995.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase primarily was a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents and loans held-for-portfolio. 
 Cash and Securities, and Investment Securities. Cash and cash equivalents increased 99.2 million, or 199.7 , to 148.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 49.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the strategic decision to sell reciprocal deposits at the end of 2023, which reduced our cash balances. These reciprocal deposits returned to our balance sheet in the first quarter of 2024, which included deposits that had been generated during the fourth quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold. In addition, balances of cash and cash equivalents increased as a result of higher overall deposit balances. 
 Investment securities decreased 282 thousand, or 2.7 , to 10.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 10.5 million at December 31, 2023. Held-to-maturity securities totaled 2.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 million at December 31, 2023. Available-for-sale securities totaled 8.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.3 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in available-for-sale securities was primarily due to regularly scheduled payments, partially offset by lower net unrealized losses resulting from an increase in yields on our agency mortgage backed securities during 2024. 
 Loans. Loans held-for-portfolio, net, increased 7.4 million, or 0.8 , to 893.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 885.7 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The following table reflects the changes in the mix of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Change Percent Change One-to-four family 271,702 279,448 (7,746) (2.8) Home equity 25,199 23,073 2,126 9.2 Commercial and multifamily 358,587 315,280 43,307 13.7 Construction and land 85,724 126,758 (41,034) (32.4) Manufactured homes 40,371 36,193 4,178 11.5 Floating homes 86,155 75,108 11,047 14.7 Other consumer 18,266 19,612 (1,346) (6.9) Commercial business 17,481 20,688 (3,207) (15.5) Premiums for purchased loans 736 829 (93) (11.2) Deferred loan fees (2,488) (2,511) 23 (0.9) Total loans held-for-portfolio, gross 901,733 894,478 7,255 0.8 Allowance for credit losses loans (8,585) (8,760) 175 (2.0) Total loans held-for-portfolio, net 893,148 885,718 7,430 0.8 
 
 As noted in the table above, increases in the loan portfolio were driven primarily by increases in commercial and multifamily loans, floating home loans, home equity loans, and manufactured home loans. The increase in commercial and multifamily loans was primarily due to the conversion of construction projects to permanent financing, while the increase in floating home loans was due to the funding of a large portfolio of individual loans that had been delayed in our pipeline. The increase in home equity loans was primarily driven by homeowners utilizing the equity in their homes. The increase in manufactured home loans was primarily the result of affordability of these homes in the current market and internal efficiencies in how we process these loans. These increases were partially offset by decreases in construction and land loans, which were primarily due to project completions and reduced demand caused by higher interest rates, which limited new financing opportunities, and decreases in one-to-four-family loans, which was primarily due to one low yielding jumbo mortgage loan that the borrower paid off early and normal loan payments exceeding loan originations. In addition, other consumer and commercial business loans decreased because of payoffs and paydowns, including the payoff of a 2.1 million commercial business loan that was previously on nonaccrual. 
 35 

At September 30, 2024, our loan portfolio, net of deferred loan fees, remained well-diversified. At that date, commercial and multifamily real estate loans accounted for 39.7 of total loans, one-to-four family loans, including home equity loans, accounted for 32.9 of total loans, commercial business loans accounted for 1.9 of total loans, and consumer loans, consisting of manufactured homes, floating homes, and other consumer loans, accounted for 16.0 of total loans. Construction and land loans accounted for 9.5 of total loans at September 30, 2024. 
 Loans held-for-sale totaled 65 thousand at September 30, 2024, compared to 603 thousand at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to timing of mortgage originations and sales. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. 
 
 The following table reflects the activity in our allowance for credit losses ACL during the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):

 Our ACL loans decreased 175 thousand, or 2.0 , to 8.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 8.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the ACL - loans from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of lower reserves on our other consumer loan portfolio and residential loan portfolios due to qualitative adjustments for changes in concentration and market conditions, partially offset by an increase in the ACL- loans due to portfolio growth, an increase in nonaccrual loans and an increase in the weighted average life of the portfolio.

 Nonperforming Assets. 
 Nonperforming assets NPAs ), which are comprised of nonperforming loans (nonaccrual loans and nonperforming modified loans), other real estate owned OREO and repossessed assets, increased 4.5 million, or 108.3 , to 8.6 million, or 0.78 of total assets, at September 30, 2024 from 4.1 million, or 0.42 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. 
 The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of NPAs at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 Nonperforming Assets September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Change Percent Change Total nonperforming loans 8,489 3,556 4,933 138.7 OREO and repossessed assets 115 575 (460) (80.0) Total nonperforming assets 8,604 4,131 4,473 108.3 
 
 The increase in NPAs primarily was due to the addition of 9.0 million of loans to nonaccrual status, which included a 3.7 million matured commercial real estate loan in process of securing financing from another lender, 3.2 million for two floating homes loans to a single borrower, and a 1.0 million commercial real estate loan, all of which are well secured, and one 
 38 

manufactured home loan of 115 thousand that was repossessed in the first quarter of 2024. These increases in NPAs were partially offset by the payoff of a 2.1 million commercial business loan, the payoff of one floating home loan of 722 thousand that was new in the first quarter of 2024 (included above in additions), the return of five loans to accrual status, and normal payment amortization. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the repossessed manufactured home noted above was sold for a small gain on sale. The percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.94 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.40 at December 31, 2023. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights increased 33 thousand or 0.7 , to 4.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million at December 31, 2023. We record mortgage servicing rights on loans sold with servicing retained and upon acquisition of a servicing portfolio. Mortgage servicing rights are carried at fair value. If the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights fluctuates significantly, our financial results could be materially impacted. 
 Deposits and Borrowings. Total deposits increased 103.7 million, or 12.5 , to 930.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 826.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was largely a result of the strategic movement of reciprocal deposits off balance sheet at year-end, which then returned in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, there was an increase in money market accounts, which was partially offset by decreases in public funds accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, and savings accounts. The shift occurred as interest rate sensitive clients moved a portion of their non-operating deposit balances from lower costing deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, into higher costing money market accounts. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased 3.0 million, or 2.4 , to 129.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 126.7 million at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 13.9 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 15.3 at December 31, 2023.

 The aggregate amount of time deposits in denominations of more than 250,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, totaled 88.1 million and 88.3 million, respectively. Deposit amounts in excess of 250,000 are not federally insured. As of September 30, 2024, uninsured deposits totaled 148.1 million, which represented 15.9 of total deposits, as compared to uninsured deposits of 140.1 million, or 17.0 of total deposits as of December 31, 2023. The uninsured amounts are estimates based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements. The increase in 
 39 

uninsured deposits primarily related to jumbo tier pricing offered on some of our deposit products, as well as normal fluctuation within deposit accounts. 
 Borrowings, comprised of FHLB advances, were 40.0 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. FHLB advances are primarily used to support organic loan growth and to maintain liquidity ratios in line with our asset/liability objectives. FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 had maturities ranging from late 2024 through early 2028. Subordinated notes, net totaled 11.7 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity increased 1.6 million, or 1.6 , to 102.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 100.7 million at December 31, 2023. This increase primarily reflects 2.7 million of net income earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 251 thousand in proceeds from exercises of stock options, partially offset by the cash payment of 1.5 million in dividends to the Company s stockholders. 

Average Balances, Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid 
 The following tables present, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates. Income and yields on tax-exempt obligations have not been computed on a tax equivalent basis. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield for the period they have been on nonaccrual (dollars in thousands).

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between changes related to outstanding balances and changes due to interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate (dollars in thousands).

 Comparison of Results of Operation for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. 
 Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023 . Net income decreased 15 thousand, or 1.3 , to 1.2 million, or 0.45 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was the result of a 295 thousand decrease in net interest income, offset by a 154 thousand increase in noninterest income, a 31 thousand decrease in noninterest expense, a 67 thousand decrease in the release of credit losses, and a 28 thousand decrease in the provision for income taxes. 
 YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 . Net income decreased 3.5 million, or 56.3 , to 2.7 million, or 1.05 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.2 million, or 2.39 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of a 3.5 million decrease in net interest income, a 112 thousand decrease in the release of credit losses, a 446 thousand decrease in noninterest income and a 252 thousand increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 802 thousand decrease in the provision for income taxes. 
 
 Interest Income 
 Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023 . Interest income increased 2.2 million, or 17.0 , to 14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher average balances of loans and interest-bearing cash, a 41 basis point increase in the average yield on loans, a 20 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-bearing cash, and an eight basis point increase in the average yield on investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of investments. 
 Interest income on loans increased 1.4 million, or 11.9 , to 12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of total loans was 898.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 862.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on total loans was 5.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average balance resulted primarily from growth in commercial and multifamily loans and floating home loans. The average yield on total loans increased primarily due to variable rate loans resetting to higher market interest rates and new loan originations at higher interest rates. 
 Interest income on the investment portfolio decreased 7 thousand, or 5.0 , to 132 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 139 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a decrease in the average balance, partially offset by a higher average yield. The average balance of investments was 13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the average yield on investments increased seven basis points to 3.80 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 42 

Interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased 788 thousand, or 75.6 to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a higher average balance of and yield on cash and cash equivalents. The average yield on cash and cash equivalents increased to 5.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the higher interest rate environment. The average balance of cash and cash equivalents was 138.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 81.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average balance was due to higher average cash balances, as deposits increased during the period at a faster pace than we were able to increase loans. 
 YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 . Interest income increased 5.4 million, or 14.4 , to 42.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 37.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher average balances of loans and interest-bearing cash, and increases in average yields on loans, investments and cash and cash equivalents of 26 basis points, 26 basis points, and 61 basis points, respectively, partially offset by a lower average balance of investments. 
 Interest income on loans increased 3.0 million, or 8.7 , to 37.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a higher average balance of total loans and a 26 basis point increase in the average yield on loans. The average balance of total loans was 895.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 865.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on total loans was 5.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on total loans increased primarily due to variable rate loans adjusting to higher market interest rates and new loan originations at higher interest rates. 
 Interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased 2.4 million, or 130.19 to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a higher average balance of and yield on cash and cash equivalents. The average yield on cash and cash equivalents increased to 5.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the higher interest rate environment. During September 2024 and November 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively, which is expected to decrease the average yield on cash and cash equivalents in future periods. The average balance of cash and cash equivalents was 122.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 70.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average balance was due to higher average cash balances, as deposits increased during the period at a faster pace than we were able to increase loans. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023 . Interest expense increased 2.4 million, or 54.2 , to 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a 9.8 million increase in the average balance of certificate accounts and a 148.1 million increase in the average balance of savings and money market accounts, as well as higher average rates paid on all interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 46.3 million decrease in the average balance of demand and NOW accounts and a 2.8 million decrease in the average balance of FHLB advances. The 59 basis point increase in the rate paid on certificate accounts and the 165 basis point increase in the rate paid on savings and money market accounts contributed to an overall 89 basis point increase in the average cost of total deposits to 2.74 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 1.85 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense on borrowings, comprised solely of FHLB advances, was 434 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 473 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a six basis point decline in the average cost of FHLB advances to 4.32 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.38 for the same quarter in 2023. The average cost of FHLB advances declined due to no overnight borrowings being utilized in the current quarter as compared to utilization of overnight borrowings in the same quarter of 2023. The average balance of FHLB advances was 40.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on subordinated notes was 168 thousand for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 . Interest expense increased 8.9 million, or 80.7 , to 19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased 9.1 million, or 101.4 , to 18.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average balance of savings and money market accounts and certificate accounts, as well as higher average rates paid on these accounts, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of demand and NOW accounts. The average cost of total deposits increased 121 basis points to 2.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.45 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense on borrowings, comprised solely of FHLB advances, was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the decreased use of 
 43 

FHLB advances to supplement our liquidity needs. The average cost of FHLB advances decreased 17 basis points to 4.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.49 for the same period in 2023. The average cost of FHLB advances declined due to no overnight borrowings being utilized in the 2024 nine-month period as compared to utilization of overnight borrowings in the 2023 nine-month period. The average balance of FHLB advances was 40.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 45.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on subordinated notes was 504 thousand for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Net Interest Income. 
 Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023 . Net interest income decreased 295 thousand, or 3.6 , to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily the result of increased funding costs, primarily the rates paid on and balances of money market and certificate accounts, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of and yield earned on interest-earning assets. Net interest margin (annualized) was 2.98 and 3.38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net interest margin primarily was due to the cost of funding increasing at a faster pace than the yield earning on interest-earning assets, driven by the higher average balance of higher costing money market and certificate accounts. 
 YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 . Net interest income decreased 3.5 million, or 13.3 , to 22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin (annualized) was 2.95 and 3.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net interest income primarily resulted from an increase in the average balances of and rate paid on deposits, partially offset by higher average balances and yield earned on interest-earning assets and lower average balances and rate paid on borrowings. The decrease in net interest margin primarily was due to average interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities increasing at a faster pace than the average yields earned on interest-earning assets. 
 During 2023, in response to inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 , where it remained until September 18, 2024. In light of the progress on reducing inflation and after considering the balance of risks, the FOMC decided to lower the target range 50 basis points to 4.75 to 5.00 . 
 
 Provision for Credit Losse s. 
 The following table reflects the components of the provision for (release of) credit losses during the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision for (release of) credit losses on loans 106 224 (88) 227 (Release of) provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments (98) (149) (46) (473) Provision for (release of) credit losses 8 75 (134) (246) 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans was primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and higher quantitative loss rates, which were influenced by a forecast of higher unemployment in the current quarter. The current quarter also included enhancements to the loss model, including an additional qualitative adjustment related to loan review. The release of credit losses on unfunded loan commitments related to overall fewer loan commitments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the release of credit losses on loans primarily related to lower reserves on our other consumer loan portfolio and residential loan portfolios due to qualitative adjustments for changes in concentration, the value of underlying collateral, and market conditions, partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio, an increase in nonaccrual loans and the weighted average life of the portfolio, and enhancements to the loss model as noted above. The release of provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments during the current nine-month period related to overall fewer loan commitments. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 14 thousand, compared to 3 thousand for three months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 87 thousand, compared to net charge-offs of 148 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the ACL are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. A further decline in national and local economic conditions, as a result of the effects of inflation, and a potential recession or slowed economic growth, among other factors, could result in a material increase in the ACL and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of 
 44 

operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ACL is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the adjustment of reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased 154 thousand, or 14.2 , to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as reflected below (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Amount Change Percent Change 2024 2023 Service charges and fee income 628 700 (72) (10.3) Earnings on BOLI 186 88 98 111.4 Mortgage servicing income 280 295 (15) (5.1) Fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights 101 (78) 179 (229.5) Net gain on sale of loans 40 76 (36) (47.4) Total noninterest income 1,235 1,081 154 14.2 
 The increase in noninterest income was due to a 98 thousand increase in earnings on BOLI due to market rate fluctuations, and an 179 thousand increase in the fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights due to changes in prepayment speeds, servicing costs, and discount rate. These increases were partially offset by a 72 thousand decrease in service charges and fee income, primarily due to a volume incentive paid by Mastercard in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a 36 thousand decrease in net gain on sale of loans resulting from lower mortgage activity, and a decrease in mortgage servicing income as a result of the portfolio paying down at a faster rate than we are replacing the loans. Additionally, mortgage servicing income decreased by 15 thousand compared to the third quarter of 2023. Loans sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled 2.4 million, compared to 4.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Noninterest income decreased 446 thousand, or 11.3 , to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as reflected below (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Amount Change Percent Change 2024 2023 Service charges and fee income 2,001 1,951 50 2.6 Earnings on BOLI 498 957 (459) (48.0) Mortgage servicing income 841 891 (50) (5.6) Fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights (81) (123) 42 (34.1) Net gain on sale of loans 205 264 (59) (22.3) Other income 30 30 100.0 Total noninterest income 3,494 3,940 (446) (11.3) 
 The decrease in noninterest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily resulted from a 459 thousand decrease in earnings on BOLI due to a death benefit received in the second quarter of 2023, a 59 thousand decrease in net gain on sale of loans resulting from lower mortgage activity and a 50 thousand decline in mortgage servicing income for the same reasons discussed above for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases were partially offset by a 50 thousand increase in service charges and fee income due to the recovery of potential future lost fee income due to vendor error, a 42 thousand upward adjustment in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights due to changes in prepayment speeds, servicing costs, and discount rate, and a 30 thousand gain on disposal of assets due to insurance claims on loss of fully depreciated assets. Loans sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 10.6 million, compared to 14.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 45 

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased 31 thousand, or 0.4 , to 7.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as reflected below (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Amount Change Percent Change 2024 2023 Salaries and benefits 4,469 4,148 321 7.7 Operations 1,540 1,625 (85) (5.2) Regulatory assessments 189 183 6 3.3 Occupancy 414 458 (44) (9.6) Data processing 1,067 1,296 (229) (17.7) Net (gain) on OREO and repossessed assets Total noninterest expense 7,679 7,710 (31) (0.4) 
 
 The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a decrease in data processing expenses of 229 thousand, due to one-time costs related to new technology implemented in 2023. Operations expense decreased 85 thousand due to reductions in loan origination costs, office expenses, marketing costs, legal fees, and charitable contributions, partially offset by an operational loss from a fraudulently obtained loan charged off in the third quarter of 2024. Occupancy expenses decreased 44 thousand, primarily due to fully amortized leasehold improvements. Salaries and benefits increased 321 thousand, reflecting higher incentive compensation, medical expenses, retirement plan costs, and directors' fees (due to the addition of a new director), partially offset by lower salaries from a restructuring of positions at the end of 2023. 
 The efficiency ratio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 84.31 , compared to 83.36 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The deterioration in the efficiency ratio was primarily due to lower net interest income resulting from a faster increase in interest expense compared to interest income. 
 Noninterest expense increased 252 thousand, or 1.1 , to 23.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as reflected below (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Amount Change Percent Change 2024 2023 Salaries and benefits 13,670 13,333 337 2.5 Operations 4,566 4,557 9 0.2 Regulatory assessments 598 490 108 22.0 Occupancy 1,255 1,352 (97) (7.2) Data processing 2,995 3,077 (82) (2.7) Net (gain) loss on OREO and repossessed assets (10) 13 (23) (176.9) Total noninterest expense 23,074 22,822 252 1.1 
 Salaries and benefits increased for the reasons noted above. Regulatory assessments increased primarily due to higher regulatory exam costs paid in the 2024 nine-month period and an increase in regulatory assessments due to the change in the assessment rate in the prior year not being adjusted for until later in 2023. These increases were partially offset by decreases in occupancy expense, data processing expense, and net (gain) loss on OREO and repossessed assets. Occupancy expenses decreased from the prior year nine-month period as a result of the release of an accrual for property taxes due to lower than expected payments and fully amortized leasehold improvements in the 2024 nine-month period. Data processing expense decreased due to costs related to new technology implemented in 2023, partially offset by a higher volume of transaction activity in the 2024 nine-month period. The net gain on OREO and repossessed assets in the current year nine-month period relates to the sale of a longtime OREO property at a gain, partially offset by expenses related to the foreclosure of one manufactured home loan in the first quarter of 2024. The net loss on OREO and repossessed assets in the prior year nine-month period relates to the expenses associated with, and the charge-off of, a former OREO property during the first quarter of 2023, which was partially offset by the sale of that property at a gain in the second quarter of 2023. 
 46 

Income Tax Expense . The provision for income taxes was 267 thousand and 617 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 295 thousand and 1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 18.79 and 18.50 , respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 20.15 and 18.56 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the same period in the prior year as a result of higher earnings on our BOLI in the current quarter, which was nontaxable income. 

Capital and Liquidity 
 The Management s Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K contains an overview of Sound Financial Bancorp s and the Bank s liquidity management, sources of liquidity and cash flows. Although there have been no material changes in our liquidity management, sources of liquidity and cash flows since our 2023 Form 10-K, this discussion updates that disclosure for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Capital. Stockholders equity totaled 102.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 100.7 million at December 31, 2023. In addition to net income of 2.7 million, other sources of capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily included 251 thousand in proceeds from stock option exercises, and 291 thousand related to stock-based compensation, and 66 thousand of other comprehensive income, net of tax, primarily resulting from unrealized gains on available for sale securities. Uses of capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily included 1.5 million of dividends paid on common stock, 65 thousand in common stock repurchases and 218 thousand in common stock surrendered to pay the exercise price of stock option exercises. 
 We paid cash dividends of 0.57 per common share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.55 per common share during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which equates to a dividend payout ratio of 53.66 and 22.88 , respectively. The Company expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, subject to the Board of Directors' discretion to change this practice at any time and for any reason, without prior notice. Assuming continued payment of the regular quarterly cash dividend during the remainder of 2024 at the rate of 0.19 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately 487 thousand based on the number of outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024. 
 The dividends, if any, we pay may be limited as more fully discussed under Business How We Are Regulated Limitations on Dividends and Stock Repurchases contained in Item 1, Part I of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Stock Repurchase Programs. From time to time, our Board of Directors has authorized stock repurchase programs. In general, stock repurchases allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to stockholders. Stock repurchases may also offset the dilutive effects of stock compensation awards. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.4 million of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase program. Purchases under the Company s existing stock repurchase program may be made through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as any constraints specified in any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. The Company s stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares. For additional details on our stock repurchase program, see Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds contained in Part II, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Liquidity. Liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of potential opportunities presented by changes in market interest rates. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. The objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We seek to achieve this objective and ensure our that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through asset/liability management, which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet. Our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets. 
 Asset liquidity is provided by assets that are readily marketable or pledgeable or that will mature in the near future. Liquid assets generally include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, securities available for sale, maturities and cash flows from securities, sales of fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and federal funds sold. Liability liquidity generally is provided by access to funding sources, which include core deposits and advances from the FHLB and other borrowing relationships with third party financial institutions. 
 47 

We continuously monitor our liquidity position and adjust the balance between sources and uses of funds as we deem appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding challenges resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 157.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, and 65 thousand in loans held-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow 168.1 million in FHLB advances and access to additional borrowings of 21.9 million through the Federal Reserve's discount window, in each case subject to certain collateral requirements. We had 40.0 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB and none from the Federal Reserve at September 30, 2024. We also had a 20.0 million credit facility with Pacific Coast Banker s Bank available, with no balance outstanding, at September 30, 2024. Subject to market conditions, we expect to utilize these borrowing facilities from time to time in the future to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy other financial commitments, repay maturing debt and to take advantage of investment opportunities to the extent feasible. As of September 30, 2024, management was not aware of any events reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us. For additional details, see Note 8 Borrowings, FHLB Stock and Subordinated Notes in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments. Refer to the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of September 30, 2024. These include payments related to (i) long-term borrowings (Note 8 Borrowings, FHLB Stock and Subordinated Notes) and (ii) operating leases (Note 11 Leases). See the discussion below for information regarding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. 
 The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its clients. These financial instruments generally represent commitments to extend credit in the form of loans. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit- and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company's exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the agreement. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the client. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These commitments are not reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluates each client's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management's credit evaluation of the client. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, financial instrument contractual amounts representing credit risk were as follows (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Residential mortgage commitments 2,766 10,465 Unfunded construction commitments 27,171 34,667 Unused lines of credit 26,667 27,245 Irrevocable letters of credit 153 277 Total loan commitments 56,757 72,654 
 Sound Financial Bancorp is a separate legal entity from Sound Community Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its own operating expenses (many of which are paid to Sound Community Bank), Sound Financial Bancorp is responsible for paying for any stock repurchases, dividends declared to its stockholders, interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and other general corporate expenses. 
 Sound Financial Bancorp is a holding company and does not conduct operations; its sources of liquidity are generally dividends up-streamed from Sound Community Bank, interest on investment securities, if any, and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the dividends that may be paid to Sound Financial Bancorp by Sound Community Bank. See Business How We Are Regulated Limitations on Dividends and Stock Repurchases contained in Item 1, Part I of the 
 48 

Company s 2023 Form 10-K. At September 30, 2024 Sound Financial Bancorp, on an unconsolidated basis, had 1.3 million in cash, noninterest-bearing deposits and liquid investments generally available for its cash needs. 
 See also the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-Q, for further information. 

Regulatory Capital 
 Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, we actively seek to maintain a well-capitalized status for the Bank per the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ). Qualifying institutions that elect to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, or CBLR, framework, such as the Bank and the Company, that maintain the required minimum leverage ratio will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the regulatory agencies' capital rules, and to have met the capital requirements for the well capitalized category under the agencies PCA framework. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s and the Company s CBLRs were 10.40 and 9.36 , respectively, which exceeded the minimum requirement of 9 . 
 In February 2019, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase-in over a three-year period the Day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects of the CECL accounting standard. The capital relief is phased into regulatory capital at 25 per year over a three-year transition period. The final rule was adopted and became effective in September 2020. The Company implemented the CECL model commencing January 1, 2023 and elected to phase in the full effect of CECL on regulatory capital over the three-year transition period. 
 See "Part I, Item 1. Business Regulation of Sound Community Bank Capital Rules " in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information related to regulatory capital. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company provided information about market risk in Item 7A of its 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our market risk since our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and several other members of the Company s senior management. The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 We intend to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and to improve the Company s controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company s business. While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve this goal, future events affecting our business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. 
 The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 49 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
