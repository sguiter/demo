In accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that long-lived assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company's share price continued to deteriorate and a major slowdown in operations occurred, leading the Company to perform an impairment test. For detailed information on impairments related to long-lived assets, refer to Notes 7 and 8.

Ltd., ("Wevo"), an Israel-based software startup, specializing in EV charging optimization and management for sites with large quantities of EV chargers, which represented of Wevo's outstanding shares. Wevo's solution will also be part of the SolarEdge ONE energy optimization system for the Commercial and Industrial ("C I") segment, designed to offer SolarEdge customers a single energy optimization solution that orchestrates and integrates between on-site solar generation, battery storage and large-scale EV charging. 

On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of all remaining outstanding shares of Wevo for approximately in cash. 

Pursuant to ASC 805, "Business Combination", the Company accounted for the Wevo acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets and liabilities of Wevo, including identifiable intangible assets, were recorded based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the closing of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Such preliminary valuation required estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating future cash flows and direct costs in addition to developing the appropriate discount rates and current market profit margins. The Company s management believes the fair values recognized for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were based on reasonable estimates and assumptions. 

From the initial investment through to the purchase of all remaining shares, the Company's share of net losses were . 

The fair value of the original investment was determined by multiplying the total fair value of Wevo, as outlined below, by the Company's ownership stake and applying a discount to account for lack of control. 

The Company determined that the acquisition date fair value of the original investment on April 1, 2024 was , resulting in a gain of . 

The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values estimation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition:

Acquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income (loss). 

Goodwill generated from this acquisition was primarily attributable to expected post-acquisition synergies from combining Wevo's platform with the Company's product offering to its commercial and industrial customers. All of the Goodwill was assigned to the Solar segment (see Note 24). Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of technology, customer relationships and trade name were derived by applying the multi-period excess earnings method, with-and-without method, and the relief-from-royalty method, respectively, all of which are under the income approach whose underlying inputs are considered Level 3. The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management's estimates and assumptions. 

The results of Wevo have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of income (loss) since its acquisition date and are not material. Pro forma financial information has not been presented because the impact of the acquisition was not material to the Company's statements of income (loss).

The Company purchases these components directly from other suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components to the contract manufacturers in its revenues. 

2 Loan receivables are loans to third parties. The loan repayments are expected on a monthly or annual basis as per the contractual terms of each loan agreement. The loan is measured at its amortized cost and is subjected to the Company's credit risk policy. The loans bear interest that represents market interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's provision for credit loss was which was recorded under Financial income (expense), net.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the Company determines the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable based upon the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying amounts over the estimated fair values of the property, plant and equipment. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company identified certain conditions in which, events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable and as a result conducted impairment assessments. 
 
 Upon completion of such assessments, the Company disposed by abandonment and impaired certain property, plants and equipment, including but not limited to, machinery, buildings, plants, and assets under construction in the Solar and Energy Storage asset groups.

of its convertible senior notes, due 2025 (the Notes 2025 ). The Notes 2025 were sold pursuant to an indenture, dated September 25, 2020 (the Indenture ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes 2025 do not bear regular interest and mature on , unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. The Notes 2025 are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. Holders may convert their Notes 2025 prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2025 in multiples of principal amount, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five-business-day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes 2025 for each trading day of that five consecutive trading day period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described in the Indenture. In addition, holders may convert their Notes 2025, in multiples of 1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time beginning on or after June 15, 2025, and prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date of the Notes 2025, without regard to the foregoing circumstances. The initial conversion rate for the Notes 2025 was shares of common stock per principal amount of Notes 2025, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the Indenture. 

Upon conversion, the Company may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. 

In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes 2025 may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes 2025, in multiples of 1,000 principal amounts, at a repurchase price of 100 of the principal amount of the Notes 2025, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date. If certain fundamental changes referred to as make-whole fundamental changes occur, the conversion rate for the Notes 2025 may be increased. 

of its convertible senior notes, due in 2029 (the Notes 2029 ). The Notes 2029 were sold pursuant to an indenture, dated June 28, 2024 (the Indenture 2029 ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes 2029 will bear interest at a rate of 2.25 per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2025. The Notes 2029 mature on , unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes 2029 are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. Holders may convert their Notes 2029 at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 1, 2029 in multiples of principal amount, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes 2029 for each trading day of that five consecutive trading day period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events or if the Company provides a notice of redemption as described in the Indenture 2029. In addition, holders may convert their Notes 2029, in multiples of 1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time beginning on or after April 1, 2029, and prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date of the Notes 2029, without regard to the foregoing circumstances. The initial conversion rate for the Notes 2029 is shares of common stock per principal amount of Notes 2029, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the Indenture 2029. 

Upon conversion, the Company may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. 

In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture 2029), holders of the Notes 2029 may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes 2029, in multiples of principal amounts, at a repurchase price of 100 of the principal amount of the Notes 2029, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the repurchase date. If certain fundamental changes referred to as make-whole fundamental changes occur, the conversion rate for the Notes 2029 may be increased. 

The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes 2029 were approximately , after deducting fees and estimated expenses. Congruently, the Company has entered into capped call transactions (as detailed below). The Company used approximately of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. The Company also used approximately of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase principal amount of its Notes 2025. The Company recorded under other income a gain of from the repurchase of Notes 2025. 

The Company accounts for the Notes 2029 at amortized cost, as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the liability is represented by the face amount of the Notes 2029, less debt issuance costs, adjusted for any amortization of issuance costs. Issuance costs are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Notes 2029, using the effective interest rate method. 

The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of the Notes 2029 and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes 2029, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions. The strike price initially corresponds to the conversion price of the Notes and is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. If, however, the market price per share of common stock exceeds , the initial cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be unmitigated dilution and/or no offset of any cash payments, in each case, attributable to the amount by which the market price of the common stock exceeds the cap price. The cap price is subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. 

The capped call transactions are considered a freestanding instrument as they were entered into separately and apart from Notes 2029. In addition, the conversion or redemption of the Notes 2029 would not automatically result in the exercise of the capped call. 

As the capped call transactions are indexed to the Company's common stock, they were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

O n July 8, 2024 the Company sold to Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers (the Initial Purchasers ), and the Initial Purchasers purchased from the Company, aggregate principal amount of additional Notes 2029. The additional Notes 2029 were sold pursuant to the Initial Purchasers exercise of the option granted by the Company to the Initial Purchasers to purchase additional Notes 2029, solely to cover over-allotments, under the purchase agreement described in the Company's Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2024. 
 
 The net proceeds from the exercise of the option granted by the Company to the Initial Purchasers of the Notes 2029 were approximately , after deducting fees and estimated expenses. Congruently, the Company has entered into additional capped call transactions. The Company used approximately of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the additional capped call transactions. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.

The market condition for the PSUs is based on the Company s share price target or total shareholder return ("TSR") compared to the TSR of companies listed in the S P 500 index over a one to three year performance period. The Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for these awards, which takes into consideration the market price of a share of the Company s common stock on the date of grant less the present value of dividends expected during the requisite service period, as well as the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition. The Company recognizes such compensation expenses on an accelerated vesting method.

On November 3, 2023, Daphne Shen, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a proposed class action complaint for violation of federal securities laws, individually and punitively on behalf of all others similarly situated, in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York against the Company, the Company s CEO and the Company s CFO. The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, as well as violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. The complaint seeks class certification, damages, interest, attorneys fees, and other relief. On December 13, 2023, Javier Cascallar filed a similar proposed class action. On February 7, 2024, the Court consolidated the two actions (the "Consolidated Securities Litigation"), and appointed co-lead plaintiffs (the "Plaintiffs") and lead counsel. On April 22, 2024, the co-lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding two additional officers. The amended complaint makes substantially similar allegations and claims. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on July 15, 2024 (the Motion ). The Motion was fully briefed as of September 16, 2024, and the parties are awaiting a decision. Due to the early stage of this proceeding, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss, if any, or the likelihood of a potential adverse outcome. The Company disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against them. 

On March 15, 2024, Abdul Hirani Hirani filed a purported derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain current and former Company executive officers and board members, including Zvi Lando, Ronen Faier, Nadav Zafrir, Betsy Atkins, Marcel Gani, Dana Gross, Dirk Hoke, Avery More, and Tal Payne (collectively, Defendants ). The Hirani complaint makes largely the same allegations as those in the Consolidated Securities Litigation described above, namely, that the Company failed to disclose information about its inventory in Europe and cancellation rates from European distributors, which allegedly resulted in material misstatements about the Company s business and prospects in its quarterly filings. On June 10, 2024, Jonathan Blaufarb Blaufarb filed a second purported derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the same Defendants as those named in the Hirani Complaint. The Blaufarb complaints makes largely the same allegations as well. It also pleads the same counts as those in the Hirani complaint, as well as additional counts for abuse of control and gross mismanagement. Defendants accepted service of the Hirani and Blaufarb complaints via stipulation that was so-ordered on July 12, 2024, and the two cases were consolidated (the Consolidated Derivative Actions with the Hirani matter designated as the lead case. On September 9, 2024, the parties agreed to stay the Consolidated Derivative Actions pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in the Consolidated Securities Litigation. 

On August 7, 2024, Edwin Isaac Isaac filed a purported derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the same Defendants as those named in the Consolidated Securities Litigation. The Isaac complaint makes largely the same allegations as those included in the amended complaint in the Consolidated Securities Litigation and Consolidated Derivative Actions. It also pleads the similar counts to those in the Consolidate Securities Litigation, including (i) breach of fiduciary duty, (ii) contribution, (iii) violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9, (iv) unjust enrichment, (v) waste of corporate assets, and (vi) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. The parties are conferring on service of process and a possible stay of proceedings pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the Consolidated Securities Litigation. 

In August 2019, the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in the civil courts of Milan, Italy against the Italian subsidiary of SolarEdge e-Mobility S.r.l (previously SMRE S.p.A) that purchased the shares of SolarEdge e-Mobility S.r.l in the tender offer that followed the SolarEdge e-Mobility S.r.l Acquisition by certain former shareholders of SolarEdge e-Mobility S.r.l who tendered their shares. The lawsuit asked for damages of approximately , representing the difference between the amount for which they tendered their shares Euro per share) and Euros per share. In December 2023, the court of Milan, rendered a decision ordering SolarEdge to pay, in favor of each plaintiff, the difference between the price paid Euro per share) and Euro per share, (i.e. euros per share) for a total payment of approximately , which consists, in addition to the shareholders' compensation, legal expenses, court fees, VAT, and CPA expenses per local law.

, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, where the Company reported income taxes at an effective tax rate of ) . 

The change in effective tax rate in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 is mainly due to the impairments and disposals, which significantly increased the quarterly loss before income tax, offset by higher tax expenses resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance during the quarter. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported income taxes at an effective tax rate of ) , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, where the Company reported income taxes at an effective tax rate of . 

The change in effective tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 is mainly due to the Company transitioning to a loss position in 2024 which has increased significantly as a result of impairments and disposals, in addition to higher tax expenses due to valuation allowance. 

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company believes they will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, including historical information, long range forecast of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning strategies. Amounts recorded for valuation allowance can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and can rely on estimates and assumptions. Based primarily on the negative evidence outweighing the positive evidence, including the Company's three year cumulative, consolidated GAAP loss, historical tax losses and the difficulty in forecasting excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation, the Company believes there is uncertainty as to when it will be possible to utilize certain net operating losses (each a "NOL"), credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. Therefore, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets for which it is more-likely-than-not they will not be realized. 

Should the Company's operating results improve and projections show continued utilization of the tax attributes, the Company would consider that as significant positive evidence and future reassessment may result in the determination that all or a portion of the valuation allowance is no longer required. If this were to occur, any reversal of the valuation allowance would result in a corresponding non-cash income tax benefit, thereby increasing total DTAs. 

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded valuation allowance in the amount of and , respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, unrecognized tax benefits were valued at and , respectively. If recognized, such benefits would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate. 

The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. The total amount of penalties and interest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. 

In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ), which includes several incentives intended to promote clean energy, battery and energy storage, electrical vehicles, and other solar products, and is expected to impact our business and operations. As part of such incentives, the IRA will, among other things, extend the investment tax credit ITC through 2034 and is therefore expected to increase the demand for solar products. The IRA is expected to further incentivize residential and commercial solar customers and developers due to the inclusion of significant tax credits for qualifying energy projects, and Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits ("AMPTC") for U.S. manufacturing of eligible components (under IRC 45X), including PV inverters and DC-optimized systems. The Company has been manufacturing eligible products in the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2023. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company manufactured and sold products that entitle it to and of AMPTCs, respectively, which were recorded as a reduction in of cost of revenues. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 benefits from AMPTCs of and , respectively, were recorded as a tax prepayment within prepaid expenses and other current assets. 

On October 24, 2024, final regulations concerning the application of IRC 45X were published. The regulations contain detailed rules concerning the eligibility, qualifying and accounting for AMPTCs. Of particular relevance to the Company are the rules concerning the qualification and measurement of AMPTCs to Residential Inverters, Commercial Inverters and DC-Optimized Inverter Systems, that are included in the definition of Microinverters.

 Overview 
 
 We develop, manufacture and sell products in a solar segment that addresses a broad range of energy market segments through our diversified product offering, including residential, commercial and large scale photovoltaic or PV, energy storage and backup solutions, electric vehicle or EV charging capabilities, home energy management, grid services and virtual power plants, as well as products in our non-solar businesses including lithium-ion cells, batteries and energy storage systems, which are part of our Energy Storage Segment as well as automation machines ("Automation Machines") and in prior years, we also had product offerings for the e-mobility market. In October 2023, we decided to discontinue our light commercial vehicle ("LCV") e-Mobility activity. The remaining e-mobility activity, which includes PV applications, has been included under the solar segment starting January 1, 2024. 
 
 The Company identified two reportable segments: the Solar segment and Energy Storage segment. The Solar segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, and sales of its DC optimized inverter solutions designed to maximize power generation at the PV module level and batteries for PV applications. The Solar segment solution consists mainly of the Company s power optimizers, inverters, batteries and cloud based monitoring platform. The Energy Storage segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, and sales of high-energy, high-power, lithium-ion cells and BESS solutions for the C I and Utility markets. The Energy Storage segment provides purpose-built components and solutions, hardware and software, as well as pre and post sales engineering support to design, build, and manage battery and system solutions according to the customer s use cases and mission profiles. The All other category includes the design, development, manufacturing and sales of e-Mobility products (in prior periods) and automated machines.

In the third quarter of 2020, we began commercial shipments from our manufacturing facility in the North of Israel, Sella 1 . The proximity of Sella 1 to our R D team and labs enables us to accelerate new product development cycles, as well as define equipment and manufacturing processes of newly developed products which can then be adopted by our contract manufacturers worldwide. In May 2022, we opened Sella 2 , our own manufacturing facility for Li-Ion cells, in Korea. Sella 2 currently has a 2GWh capacity. In light of the Inflation Reduction Act legislation in the United States, which incentivizes the local manufacturing of renewable energy products by providing benefits to installers for the purchase and installation of product with domestic content, as well as by incentivizing local manufacturing of our products, we began manufacturing inverters in Texas and reached full capacity there during the third quarter of 2024. We are also currently expanding additional manufacturing capabilities in G, for optimizers and inverters. With the manufacturing capabilities of these new sites and due to a decrease in demand for our products, we have reduced capacity in all of our manufacturing sites outside of the U.S. As of September 30, 2024, we shipped approximately 130.0 million power optimizers, 5.7 million inverters and 303.3 thousand batteries for PV applications. Over 4.1 million installations, many of which may include multiple inverters, are currently connected to, and monitored through, our cloud-based monitoring platform. As of September 30, 2024, we shipped approximately 55.3 GW of our DC optimized inverter systems and approximately 2.1 GWh of our batteries for PV applications. 

Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 260.9 million and 725.3 million, respectively,. Gross loss was 269.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to our gross margin of 19.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 1,205.3 million and 61.2 million, respectively. 

Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 730.7 million and 2,660.5 million, respectively. Gross loss was 101.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to our gross margin of 28.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,493.5 million compared to our net income in the amount of 196.7 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Global Circumstances Influencing our Business and Operations 
 
 Demand for Products 
 
 We have seen a slowdown in demand for our products in our Solar segment from our direct customers since the second part of the third quarter of 2023. This was a result of slowed market demand in the third quarter of 2023, as distributors began to take actions to reduce inventory levels. In particular, beginning in the second part of the third quarter of 2023, we experienced substantial unexpected cancellations and push outs of existing backlog from our European distributors. We attribute these cancellations and push outs to high inventory in the channels and slower than expected installation rates both in the United States and Europe. This trend continued in the subsequent quarters. Additionally, the Company anticipates a continued lower level of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024 when compared to the same quarter last year, as the inventory destocking process continues. 
 
 Disruptions due to the war in Israel 
 
 Due to the war that began on October 7, 2023, some of our employees in Israel were called to active reserve duty and additional employees may be called in the future, if needed. In the three months ended September 30, approximately 10 of our employees in Israel have been called to active reserve duty for varying periods. While our offices and facilities are open worldwide, including in Israel, and, to date, we have not had disruptions to our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services to customers, a prolonged war or an escalation of the current condition in Israel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Due to the ongoing and evolving nature, and the extent of these events, the adverse effect on our business operations is still unknown. 

The majority of our key employees and officers are residents of Israel. If any of our facilities in Israel were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise rendered unable to operate, whether due to war, acts of hostility, earthquakes, fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, other natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages or otherwise, or if performance of our research and development is disrupted for any other reason, such an event could delay commercialization of our products, and if we choose to manufacture all or any part of them internally, jeopardize our ability to manufacture our products as promptly as our prospective customers will likely expect, or possibly at all. If we experience delays in achieving our development objectives within a timeframe that meets our prospective customers expectations, our business, prospects, financial results and reputation could be harmed.

Impact of Ukraine s Conflict on the Energy Landscape 
 
 The conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which started in early 2022, and the sanctions and other measures imposed in response to this conflict, have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. While we do not have any meaningful business in Russia or Ukraine and we do not have physical assets in these countries, this conflict has, and is likely to continue to have, a multidimensional impact on the global economy, the energy landscape in general and the global supply chain. In 2022, rising global interest in becoming less dependent on gas and oil led to higher demand for our products. The conflict adversely affected the prices of raw materials arriving from Eastern Asia and resulted in an increase in gas and oil prices. Furthermore, various shipment routes were adversely impacted by the conflict resulting in increased shipment lead times and shipping costs for our products. While the impact of this conflict continued to decrease in 2024, a change or escalation of this ongoing conflict could increase the impacts from the circumstances described above and may lead to an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Inflation Reduction Act 
 
 In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ), which includes several provisions intended to accelerate U.S. manufacturing and adoption of clean energy, battery and energy storage, electrical vehicles, and other solar products and is expected to impact our business and operations. As part of such incentives, the IRA, among other things, extends the investment tax credit and production tax credit through 2034 and is therefore expected to increase the demand for solar products. The IRA also further incentivizes residential and commercial solar customers and developers through the inclusion of a tax credit for qualifying energy projects of up to 30 . Section 45X of the IRA offers advanced manufacturing production tax credits ("AMPTC") that incentivize the production of eligible components within the U.S. To that end, we established manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. in 2023. These provisions of the law are new and regulations and guidance concerning their implementation are gradually being published by the U.S. Treasury Department. On October 24, 2024, final regulations concerning the application of IRC 45X were published. The regulations contain detailed rules concerning the eligibility, qualifying and accounting for AMPTCs. Of particular relevance to the Company are the rules concerning the qualification and measurement of AMPTCs to Residential Inverters, Commercial Inverters and DC-Optimized Inverter Systems, that are included in the definition of Microinverters. 
 
 We continue to monitor the benefits that may be available to us, such as the availability of tax credits for domestic manufacturers and the domestic content tax credit bonus that provides incentives for project owners.

Key Operating Metrics 
 
 In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics. These operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections. We use metrics relating to shipments of inverters, power optimizers and megawatts to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products. 
 
 We provide the megawatts shipped and megawatts hour shipped metrics, which are calculated based on inverter or battery nameplate capacity shipped, respectively, to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis. Nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter or battery, and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total nameplate capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues. However, revenues may increase in a non-correlated manner to the megawatt shipped metric since other products such as power optimizers, are not accounted for in this metric.

 Revenues decreased by 464.4 million, or 64.0 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (i) a decrease of 416.5 million related to a decrease in the number of inverters and power optimizers sold; (ii) a decrease of 22.1 million in revenues generated in 2023 from e-mobility components, related to the discontinuation of the Company s LCV e-Mobility activity; and (iii) a decrease of 14.6 million related to less ancillary solar products sold. The overall decrease in revenues was due to a decline in demand that began in the second part of the third quarter of 2023. This decline was the result of high inventory in the channels and slower than expected installation rates, leading to substantial unexpected cancellations and push outs of existing backlog, from our distributors. 
 
 Revenues from outside of the U.S. comprised 50.7 of our revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 73.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The number of power optimizers recognized as revenues decreased by approximately 1.4 million units, or 43.8 , from approximately 3.3 million units, in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 1.8 million units in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The number of inverters recognized as revenues decreased by approximately 203.9 thousand units, or 76.5 , from approximately 266.6 thousand units in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 62.7 thousand units in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The megawatts hour of batteries for PV applications recognized as revenues increased by approximately 55.2 megawatts hour, or 35.9 from approximately 153.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 208.9 megawatts hour in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of lower demand. 
 
 Our blended ASP per watt for solar products excluding batteries for PV applications is calculated by dividing the sales of solar products, excluding the sales of batteries for PV applications, by the name plate capacity of inverters shipped. Our blended ASP per watt for solar products shipped excluding batteries for PV applications increased by 0.039, or 24.0 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in blended ASP per watt is mainly attributed to a higher number of power optimizers and other solar products shipped compared to the number of inverters shipped. This increase in blended ASP per watt was partially offset by an increase in the sale of commercial products that are characterized by lower ASP per watt, out of our total solar product mix. 
 
 Our blended ASP per watt/hour for batteries for PV applications is calculated by dividing batteries for PV applications sales, by the nameplate capacity of batteries for PV applications shipped. Our blended ASP per watt/hour for batteries for PV applications decreased by 0.158, or 33.3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in blended ASP per watt/hour is mainly attributed to a price reduction of our batteries for PV applications. 
 
 Revenues decreased by 1,929.8 million, or 72.5 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (i) a decrease of 1,640.5 million related to a decrease in the number of inverters and power optimizers sold; (ii) a decrease of 167.7 million related to the lower number of batteries for PV applications sold, primarily in Europe; (iii) a decrease of 65.9 million in revenues generated from e-mobility components, related to the discontinuation of the Company s LCV e-Mobility activity; and (iv) a decrease of 60.0 million related to less ancillary solar products sold. The overall decrease in revenues was due to the decline in demand that began in the second part of the third quarter of 2023. This decline was the result of high inventory in the channels and slower than expected installation rates, leading to substantial unexpected cancellations and push outs of existing backlog, from our distributors.

Revenues from outside of the U.S. comprised 60.2 of our revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 75.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The number of power optimizers recognized as revenues decreased by approximately 10.4 million units, or 68.0 , from approximately 15.3 million units, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 4.9 million units in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The number of inverters recognized as revenues decreased by approximately 742.0 thousand units, or 79.6 , from approximately 932.4 thousand units in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 190.4 thousand units in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The megawatts hour of batteries for PV applications recognized as revenues decreased by approximately 215.2 megawatts hour, or 33.4 from approximately 643.6 megawatts hour in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 428.4 megawatts hour in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of lower demand. 
 
 Our blended ASP per watt for solar products shipped excluding batteries for PV applications increased by 0.005, or 2.9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in blended ASP per watt is mainly attributed to a higher number of power optimizers and other solar products shipped compared to the number of inverters shipped. This increase in blended ASP per watt was partially offset by price reduction as well as an increase in the sale of commercial products that are characterized by lower ASP per watt, out of our total solar product mix. 
 
 Our blended ASP per watt/hour for batteries for PV applications decreased by 0.126, or 26.3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in blended ASP per watt/hour is mainly attributed to price reduction of our batteries for PV applications.

 Cost of revenues increased by 380.7 million, or 65.4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in inventory write-down accruals of 642.4 million related to the slowdown in our products demand, and excess inventory in our channels, the repeated price reductions and the introduction of a new generation of our products, which was partially offset by: 

a decrease in direct cost of revenues sold of 157.2 million which includes a decrease in the volume of products sold and an increase of 14.0 million in AMPTC recognized; 
 
 a decrease in warranty expenses and warranty accruals of 52.1 million associated primarily with a decrease in revenues; and 
 
 a decrease in shipment and logistic costs in an aggregate amount of 44.2 million due to a decrease in volumes shipped; 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 19.7 , in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a gross loss of 269.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to: 
 
 inventory write-down accruals resulting in lower gross margin of approximately 250 ; 
 
 price reductions to our batteries for PV applications, which contributed a higher portion of our total product mix resulting in lower gross margin of approximately 23 ; 

lower absolute fixed and other production related costs, which were divided this quarter by significantly lower revenue, resulting in lower gross margin of approximately 13 . 
 
 Cost of revenues decreased by 430.0 million, or 22.6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: 
 
 a decrease in direct cost of revenues sold of 731.2 million which includes both a decrease in the volume of products sold and an increase of 44.1 million AMPTC recognized; 
 
 a decrease in warranty expenses and warranty accruals of 190.0 million associated primarily with a decrease in revenues; 
 
 a decrease in shipment and logistic costs in an aggregate amount of 124.1 million due to a decrease in volumes shipped and a decrease in expedited shipments costs. 
 
 These movements were partially offset by an increase of 636.5 million in inventory write-down related to the slowdown in our products demand and excess inventory in our channel, the repeated price reductions and the introduction of a new generation of our products. 

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 28.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to gross loss of 101.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to: 
 
 inventory write-down accruals resulting in lower gross margin of approximately 90 ; 
 
 lower absolute fixed and other production related costs, which were divided this year by a significantly lower revenue, resulting in a lower gross margin, of approximately 23 ; and

Segment analysis 
 
 In October 2023, we decided to discontinue our LCV e-Mobility activity and the remaining e-Mobility activity is included under the solar segment starting January 1, 2024. Following the discontinuation of its e-Mobility LCV activity, the Company operates in three different operating segments: Solar, Energy Storage and Automation Machines. We have identified two operating segments as reportable the Solar and the Energy Storage segments. The other operating segments are insignificant individually, and therefore, their results are presented together under All other. 

We do not allocate our operating segments revenue recognized due to advance payments received for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year financing component ), related to accounting standard codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"). 
 
 Segment profit (loss) is comprised of gross profit (loss) for the segment less operating expenses excluding amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, discontinued activity charges, impairment of property, plant and equipment and certain other items (which are reported under "Not allocated to segments").

Solar 
 
 As discussed above, this decrease in revenues was due to high inventory in the channels and slower than expected installation rates beginning in the third quarter of 2023, leading to substantial unexpected cancellations and push outs of existing backlog from our distributors. 
 
 Solar revenues decreased by 429.4 million, or 63.4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to (i) a decrease of 416.5 million related to a decrease in the number of inverters and power optimizers sold; and a decrease of 14.6 million related to less ancillary solar products sold. 
 
 Solar operating loss was 717.3 million, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to profit of 45.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was due to the decrease of 429.4 million in revenue as well as a significant increase in inventory write-down accrual of 545.2 million related to the slowdown in our products demand and the repeated price reductions, which were partially offset by a decrease in direct cost of revenues associated with a decrease in the volume of products sold of 118.0 million, a decrease in warranty expenses and warranty accruals of 51.4 million associated primarily with a decrease in revenues and a decrease in shipment and logistic costs in an aggregate amount of 32.2 million_ due to a decrease in volumes shipped; 

Solar revenues decreased by 1,853.9 million, or 73.2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to (i) a decrease of 1,640.5 million related to a decrease in the number of inverters and power optimizers sold; (ii) a decrease of 167.7 million related to the number of batteries for PV applications sold primarily in Europe; (iii) a decrease of 60.0 million related to less ancillary solar products sold. 
 
 Solar operating loss was 932.7 million, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to profit of 458.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to the decrease of 1,853.9 million in revenue followed by a decrease in direct cost of revenues of 648.8 million, a decrease in warranty expenses and warranty accruals of 192.8 million, and a decrease of 118.9 million in shipment and logistic costs, all associated with a decrease in the volume of products sold which was offset by a significant increase in inventory write-down accrual valued at 554.3 million related to the slowdown in our products demand and repeated price reductions.

 Expenses, net, not allocated to segments increased by 237.4 million, or 596.6 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.

 Expenses, net, not allocated to segments increased by 254.2 million, or 211.8 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill as well as an increase in costs related to the Restructuring Plan, all of which are not assessed by our CODM and therefore not allocated to any of the segments above.

 (239,695) 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 303.9 million. This amount does not include 430.9 million invested in available-for-sale marketable securities and 4.1 million invested in restricted bank deposits. Our principal uses of cash are for funding our operations, capital expenditures, other working capital requirements, other investments, any potential future share repurchases and the repayment of our convertible notes due 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we have open commitments for capital expenditures in an amount of approximately 18.5 million. These commitments mainly reflect purchases of automated assembly lines and other machinery related to our manufacturing and operations. We also have purchase obligations in the amount of 443.8 million related to raw materials and commitments for the future manufacturing of our products. 
 
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months as well as in the longer term, including the self-funding of our capital expenditure, operational commitments and the redemption of our debt. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Operating cash flows consist primarily of net income (loss), adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash used in operating activities increased by 285.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items generated in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net income adjusted for certain non-cash items in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by lower operating working capital requirements. 
 
 21 

Investing Activities 
 
 Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment in, sales and maturities of available for sale marketable securities, investment and withdrawal of bank deposits and restricted bank deposits, cash used for acquisitions and disbursements and receipts from collections of loans made by the Company. Cash provided by investing activities was 318.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash used in investing activities of 188.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase of 508.9 million in proceeds provided by sales and maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities and a decrease of 34.1 million in purchase of property plant and equipment and a decrease of 13.6 million in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments. These were partially offset by an increase of 22.9 million in disbursements of loans made by the Company and an increase of 17.7 million in cash used in the purchase of privately-held companies. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Financing cash flows consisted primarily of repurchases of our common stock under the share repurchase program, the issuance and repurchase of convertible notes, and our employee equity incentive plans. Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 8.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 267.9 million increase in cash used for the repurchase of convertible note, an increase of 50.3 million in cash used in share repurchases, a 28.3 million increase in cash used to purchase the capped call transactions and 13.0 million decrease in proceeds provided by the exercise of stock-based awards. This was partially offset by a 329.2 million increase in cash provided by the issuance of convertible notes and a decrease of 21.6 million in withholding taxes remitted to the tax authorities related to the exercise of stock-based awards. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 On November 1, 2023, we announced the approval by the Board of Directors of a share repurchase program which authorizes the repurchase of up to 300 million of the Company s common stock. Under the share repurchase program, repurchases can be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs and/or a non-discretionary trading plan or other means, including through 10b5-1 trading plans, all in compliance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any common share repurchases under the share repurchase program are determined by the Company in its discretion and depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The program does not obligate SolarEdge to acquire any amount of common stock, it may be suspended, extended, modified, discontinued or terminated at any time at the Company s discretion without prior notice, and will expire on December 31, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 753,364 shares of common stock from the open market at an average cost of 66.79 per share for a total of 50.3 million. 
 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 
 On June 28, 2024, we sold an aggregate principal amount of 300 million of 2.25 convertible senior notes due 2029 in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes 2029 were approximately 293.2 million, after deducting fees and estimated expenses. Separately, we have entered into capped call transactions. We used approximately 25.2 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions and approximately 267.9 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase 285.0 million principal amount of its outstanding 0.000 convertible notes due 2025. As a result of the repurchase of Notes 2025, we recognized a gain of 15.5 million which was recorded under other income. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. 
 
 On July 8, 2024, we sold an aggregate principal amount of 37 million of the Notes 2029. The Notes 2029 were sold pursuant to the Initial Purchasers exercise of the option granted by the Company to the Initial Purchasers to purchase additional Notes 2029, as described above in Note 16, Convertible Senior Notes. 

22 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates 
 
 Management believes that there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in MD A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except as mentioned in Note 1, General (if any). 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, customer concentrations, interest rates and commodity prices. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 Approximately 44.93 and 70.87 of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, were earned in non U.S. dollar denominated currencies, principally the Euro. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, primarily the U.S. dollar, NIS, Euro, and to a lesser extent, the South Korean Won KRW ). Our NIS denominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the NIS and the U.S. dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For purposes of our consolidated financial statements, local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the U.S. dollar on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar during the reporting period. 
 
 To date, we have used derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign currency forward contracts and put and call options, to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging portions of the anticipated payroll payments denominated in NIS. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. 
 
 In addition, from time to time we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge the Company s exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar, mainly forward contracts to sell Euro and AUD for U.S. dollars. These derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow hedges. 
 
 Concentrations of Major Customers 
 
 Our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers. As of September 30, 2024, three major customers jointly accounted for approximately 37.4 of our consolidated trade receivables, net balance. As of September 30, 2023, two major customers jointly accounted for approximately 37.3 of our consolidated trade receivables, net balance. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, one major customer accounted for approximately 16.7 of our total revenues. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, two major customers jointly accounted for approximately 27.3 of our total revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 one major customer accounted for approximately 11.0 of our total revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 two major customers accounted for approximately 25.4 of our total revenues. 
 
 23 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials which are used in our products, including Copper, Lithium, Nickel and Cobalt. Prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time, and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk. Significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers, and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded, as of September 30, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third fiscal quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 24 

P ART II. OTHER INFORMATION. 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the normal course of business, we may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints (including as a result of initiating such legal claims, action or complaints on behalf of the Company), including the matters described in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Item 3 Legal Proceedings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. It is impossible to predict with certainty whether any resulting liability from any such legal claims, actions or complaints would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk set forth below and the risk factors as described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Disruption to our business operations as a result of war and hostilities in Israel and other conditions in Israel that affect our operations may limit our ability to develop, produce and sell our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation s . 

Our headquarters and research and development center are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic, and military conditions in Israel directly affect us. Israel has been and is currently involved in a number of armed conflicts, including recent escalation of the conflict with Iran, and is the target of terrorist activity, including threats from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Iranian militia in Syria, and others. The state of hostility disrupts day-to-day civilian activity and negatively affects our business conditions. 
 
 Violence between Hamas and Israel started on October 7, 2023 when the terrorist group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel. On October 8, 2023 the Israeli Government declared that the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel approved a war situation in Israel. Hezbollah (an Islamist militia and political group based in Lebanon) also launched missile, rocket, and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites, troops, and towns in northern Israel in October 2023.Since our headquarters and most of our employees operate from Israel, the state of war has disrupted and is continuing to disrupt our business operations. This situation has impacted the availability of our workforce, as approximately 10 of our workforce in Israel, where we are headquartered, have been called into active reserve duty. Several of our employees who reside close to the southern or northern boarders of Israel have been forced to evacuate their homes and have relocated to temporary housing. Since the education system is partially operating, many of our employees with small children are working from home. Due to the recency of these events, and their ongoing and evolving nature, the extent of the adverse effect on our business operations is still unknown. While our offices and facilities are open worldwide, including in Israel, and, to date, we have not had disruptions to our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services to customers a prolonged war or an escalation of the current conditions in Israel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

On September 17, 2024, the Israeli cabinet declared the return of displaced Israeli residents to their homes, in the North of the country as a war goal, which has caused an intensification of fighting. The potential deterioration of Israel s economy, as a direct and indirect result of these terrorist attacks and the military campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon that has resulted from them, could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to effectively conduct our operations. 

25 

In addition, any future ongoing armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively, operate our manufacturing plant in northern Israel, engage in research and development, or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. In the event of escalation of the current war situation or others, we may be forced to cease operations, which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products. Some of our directors, executive officers, and employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances. In the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action, or hostilities otherwise disrupt the ongoing operation of our offices, our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected. 

Our commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although according to the Israeli Property Tax and Compensation Fund Regulation (Compensation Payment) (War Damage and Indirect Damage), 1973 the Israeli government should compensate physical loss or damage to the said property due to War or Terror risks on actual values, we cannot assure you that such government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our full potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Additionally, several countries principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israeli companies, and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in Israel or political instability in the region continue or increase. If instability in neighboring states results in the establishment of fundamentalist Islamic regimes or governments more hostile to Israel, or if Egypt or Jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with Israel, Israel could be subject to additional political, economic, and military confines, and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, there have been increased efforts by activists to cause companies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods and cooperation with Israeli-related entities based on Israel s military operations in Gaza and Israeli government policies. Any current or future hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 In that regard, since the start of the war on Hamas, we have become aware of pressure being placed on our customers not to engage in business with us due to our affiliation with Israel. In addition, foreign policy could be negatively impacted with regard to Israel. If these pressures intensify or continue to occur, they could impact our business with suppliers and customers which could in turn adversely impact our reputation, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Additionally, in 2023, the Israeli government announced plans to significantly reduce the Israeli Supreme Court's judicial oversight, including reducing its ability to strike down legislation that it deems unreasonable, and plans to increase political influence over the selection of judges. Although the Israeli Supreme Court partially struck down these plans, the current government has vowed to make other changes to law that limit the powers of the Supreme Court. If such government plans are eventually enacted, they may cause operational challenges for us since we are headquartered in Israel and many of our employees are located in Israel. In response to the foregoing developments, individuals, organizations and institutions, both within and outside of Israel, have voiced concerns that the proposed changes may negatively impact the business environment in Israel due in part to the reluctance of foreign investors to invest or transact business in Israel, and lead to increased volatility in foreign exchange rates involving the Israeli new shekel, downgrades in the credit rating of Israel, increased volatility in securities markets, and other changes in macroeconomic conditions. All of these risks have been compounded by the current wars against Hamas and Hezbollah. 

The loss of key executives, and our ability to retain key personnel and attract additional qualified personnel 
 
 On August 26, 2024, the Company's former CEO, Zvi Lando resigned, and the Board of Directors appointed its former CFO, Ronen Faier to the position of interim CEO. In conjunction with this transition, the Board of Directors also appointed Ariel Porat, formerly the Company s Senior Vice President of Finance, to serve as CFO. Executive leadership and senior management transitions, reductions in workforce and employee turnover can be time consuming, difficult to manage, create instability, cause disruption to our business and result in the loss of institutional knowledge, and any of these outcomes could impede the execution of our day-to-day operations and our ability to fully implement our business and growth strategy. These impacts could also make it more difficult to attract and retain talent. The failure to successfully hire and retain key executives and employees or the further loss of any key executives, senior management and employees could have a significant impact on our operations, including declining product identity and competitive differentiation, eroding employee morale and productivity or an inability to maintain internal controls, regulatory or other compliance related requirements, any and all of which could in turn adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

26 

Political uncertainty may have an adverse impact on our business. 
 
 As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we are subject to various legal, compliance and regulatory risks, including with respect to the availability of economic incentives in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Elections in various countries, including the United States and throughout Europe, may further exacerbate these risks. The lead up to these elections and their outcomes could result in sharp shifts in domestic, economic, and foreign policy approaches or significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation and regulation directly affecting us and our business, including tax incentives for the solar industry. Actions taken by new administrations may have an adverse effect on our industry and business, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth. 
 
 We have incurred significant losses and expect to incur losses in the future, which could restrict our liquidity and ability to service our debt 

The Company s accumulated deficit totaled 715.28 million as of September 30, 2024 and we expect to incur losses in future periods. These losses could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and satisfy our liquidity needs. These outcomes could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry or competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future; and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future operations are also dependent on the success of the Company s development and commercialization efforts and, ultimately, upon the market acceptance of the Company s products. Our failure to develop and commercialize its products successfully, or to achieve market acceptance for our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and subject us to further losses. 

Additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets. We test our goodwill and such assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment, and we assess on an as-needed basis whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets, which include complex, and often subjective, assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. To the extent that the factors described above change, we could be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we concluded indicators of impairment existed due to a sustained decline in the Company's stock price and, as a result, the Company s market capitalization. Therefore we performed an interim impairment test of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, which resulted in an impairment charge and disposals related to certain tangible assets of 207.4 million and a goodwill impairment charge of 2.3 million (see Notes 7, 8 and 9 to the financial statements for additional information).
