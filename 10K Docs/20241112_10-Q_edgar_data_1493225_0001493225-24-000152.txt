 The Company held pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs, REMIC mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs, corporate bonds, and U.S. Government agency securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position of twelve months or greater at September 30, 2024. There was corporate bond, pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs, and REMIC mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs that were in an unrealized loss position of less than twelve months at September 30, 2024. Substantially all securities referred to above were rated investment grade at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses on a quarterly basis. In performing an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is due to a credit loss, the Company considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, changes in credit ratings, any adverse economic conditions, as well as all relevant information at the individual security level such as credit deterioration of the issuer or collateral underlying the security. In assessing the impairment, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected with the amortized cost basis of the security. If it is determined that the decline in fair value was due to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis. The Company did t record any allowance for credit losses on its available-for-sale debt securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 The non-credit related decrease in the fair value, such as a decline due to changes in market interest rates, is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company also assesses its intent to sell the securities (as well as the likelihood of a near-term recovery). If the Company intends to sell an available-for-sale debt security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to its fair value and the write down is charged to the debt security s fair value at the reporting date with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. 
 
 The Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities from the estimate of credit losses. Accrued interest receivable associated with debt securities available-for-sale totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets . The Company elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable as an allowance on possible uncollectible accrued interest is not warranted.

 pass-through mortgage-backed debt securities held-to-maturity issued or guaranteed by GSEs that were in a continuous unrealized loss position of twelve months or greater at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company's held-to-maturity securities are residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. 
 
 The Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities from the estimate of credit losses. Accrued interest receivable associated with held-to-maturity securities totaling and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets .

As the SBA Loan Fund operates as a private fund, its shares are not publicly traded and, therefore, has no readily determinable market value. The SBA Loan Fund was recorded at net asset value as a practical expedient for reporting fair value.

 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to million at December 31, 2023. The majority of the PCD loan balances were acquired as part of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transaction. At September 30, 2024, PCD loans consisted of approximately home equity loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and in one-to-four family residential loans. At December 31, 2023, PCD loans consisted of approximately one-to-four family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and in home equity loans. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company monitors the credit quality of its loan portfolio on a regular basis. Credit quality is monitored by reviewing certain credit quality indicators. Management has determined that loan-to-value LTV ratios (at period end) and internally assigned credit risk ratings by loan type are the key credit quality indicators that best measure the credit quality of the Company s loan receivables. LTV ratios used by management in monitoring credit quality are based on current period loan balances and original appraised values at the time of origination (unless a current appraisal has been obtained as a result of the loan being deemed impaired). 
 
 The Company maintains a credit risk rating system as part of the risk assessment of its loan portfolio. The Company s lending officers are required to assign a credit risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination. This risk rating is reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary. Monthly, management presents monitored assets to the Loan Committee. In addition, the Company engages a third-party independent loan reviewer that performs semi-annual reviews of a sample of loans, validating the credit risk ratings assigned to such loans. The credit risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the provision for credit losses on loans and the allowance for credit losses for loans held-for-investment. After determining the loss factor for each portfolio segment held-for-investment, the collectively evaluated for impairment balance of the held-for-investment portfolio is multiplied by the collectively evaluated for impairment loss factor for the respective portfolio segment in order to determine the allowance for loans collectively evaluated for impairment. 
 
 When assigning a credit risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point credit risk rating system. 
 
 1. Strong 
 2. Good 
 3. Acceptable 
 4. Adequate 
 5. Watch 
 6. Special Mention 
 7. Substandard 
 8. Doubtful 
 9. Loss 
 
 Loans rated 1 to 5 are considered pass ratings. An asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets have well defined weaknesses based on objective evidence, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable based on current circumstances. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are required to be designated special mention.

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Generally, originated loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become days or more delinquent, or sooner if considered appropriate by management, and remain on non-accrual status until they are brought current, have six consecutive months of performance under the revised loan terms, and factors indicating reasonable doubt about the timely collection of payments no longer exist. Therefore, loans may be current in accordance with their loan terms, or may be less than days delinquent and still be on non-accruing status. 
 
 When an individual loan no longer demonstrates the similar credit risk characteristics as other loans within its current segment, the Company evaluates each for expected credit losses on an individual basis. All non-accrual loans and above and all loans designated as Troubled Debt Restructurings TDRs prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, are individually evaluated. See Loan Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty section below for more information. The non-accrual amounts included in loans individually evaluated for impairment were million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans on non-accrual status with principal balances less than , and therefore not meeting the Company's definition of an impaired loan, amounted to million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans past due days or more and still accruing interest were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and consisted of loans that are well-secured and in the process of collection.

 or greater. Loans individually evaluated for impairment are assessed to determine whether the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral-dependent, or the present value of the expected future cash flows, if the loan is not collateral-dependent. Management performs an evaluation of each impaired loan and generally obtains updated appraisals as part of the evaluation. In addition, management adjusts estimated fair values down to appropriately consider recent market conditions, our willingness to accept a lower sales price to effect a quick sale, and costs to dispose of any supporting collateral. Determining the estimated fair value of underlying collateral (and related costs to sell) can be difficult in illiquid real estate markets and is subject to significant assumptions and estimates. Management employs an independent third-party management firm that specializes in appraisal preparation and review to ascertain the reasonableness of updated appraisals. Projecting the expected cash flows for modified loans which are not collateral-dependent is inherently subjective and requires, among other things, an evaluation of the borrower s current and projected financial condition. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections and our established allowance for credit losses on these loans, which could have a material effect on our financial results. Individually impaired loans that have no impairment losses are not considered for collective allowances described earlier. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ACL for loans individually evaluated for impairment was million and , respectively. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Off-Balance Sheet Exposures 
 
 An ACL for off-balance-sheet exposures represents an estimate of expected credit losses arising from off-balance sheet exposures such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit (loans already on the books). Commitments to fund unused lines of credit are agreements to lend additional funds to customers as long as there have been no violations of any of the conditions established in the agreements (original or restructured). Commitments to originate loans generally have a fixed expiration or other termination clauses, which may require payment of a fee. Since some of these loan commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The reserve for off-balance sheet exposures is determined using the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL reserve factor in the related funded loan segment, adjusted for an average historical funding rate. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding provision is included in other non-interest expense.

 The allowance for credit losses on loans decreased to million at September 30, 2024, compared to million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in loan balances and an improvement in the economic forecast within our CECL model. The decrease was partially offset by increases in quantitative reserves in the commercial and industrial and home equity and lines of credit loan portfolios due to an increase in non-performing loans in these categories and loan balances.

 up to years. At September 30, 2024, all of the Company s leases are classified as operating leases, which are required to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. 
 
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recorded at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, at lease inception, over a similar term in determining the present value of lease payments. Certain leases include options to renew, with one or more renewal terms ranging from five to . If the exercise of a renewal option is considered to be reasonably certain, the Company includes the extended term in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet were million and million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the Company s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet were million and million, respectively. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are recognized as incurred. Variable lease payments include common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance costs and utilities. Operating and variable lease expenses are recorded in occupancy expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Note 1 to the Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report, contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of these accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions, and other subjective assessments. Certain assets are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at estimated fair value or the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Policies with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans and judgments regarding the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets are the most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations, involve a higher degree of complexity, and require management to make subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions, and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies and their application are reviewed periodically and, at least annually, with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses remain "critical accounting estimates" for the following reasons: 
 Changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; 
 Estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to utilize a reasonable and supportable forecast period based upon forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default rates, which our Current Expected Credit Losses CECL methodology encompasses; 
 The allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, gross domestic product, inflation, and unemployment; and 
 Judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime expected credit losses. 
 
 Our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. 
 
 For a further discussion of the critical accounting policies of the Company, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Net income was 18.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was down from the comparative prior year period primarily due to a decrease in net interest income, which was negatively impacted by higher funding costs, partially offset by improved interest and non-interest income. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were 0.45 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of 0.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income included 795,000, or 0.02 per share, of additional tax expense related to options that expired in June 2024, and 683,000, or 0.01 per share after tax, of severance expense related to modest layoffs and staffing realignments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income included 440,000, or 0.01 per share after tax, of severance expense. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Total assets increased by 132.5 million, or 2.4 , to 5.73 billion at September 30, 2024, from 5.60 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in available-for-sale debt securities of 268.0 million, or 33.7 , and cash and cash equivalents of 3.4 million, or 1.5 , partially offset by a decrease in loans receivable of 139.7 million, or 3.3 . 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 3.4 million, or 1.5 , to 232.9 million at September 30, 2024, from 229.5 million at December 31, 2023. Balances fluctuate based on the timing of receipt of security and loan repayments and the redeployment of cash into higher-yielding assets such as loans and securities, or the funding of deposit outflows or borrowing maturities. 
 
 The Company s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio increased by 268.0 million, or 33.7 , to 1.06 billion at September 30, 2024, from 795.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to purchases of securities, partially offset by paydowns, maturities and calls. At September 30, 2024, 869.4 million of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. In addition, the Company held 74.9 million in U.S. Government agency securities, 118.5 million in corporate bonds, substantially all of which were investment grade, and 684,000 in municipal bonds at September 30, 2024. Unrealized losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities and held-to-maturity securities approximated 19.6 million and 219,000, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and 32.5 million and 279,000, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The decrease in unrealized losses was the result of the impact of the 50 basis point decrease in interest rates declared by the Federal Reserve. The effective duration of the securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 was 1.65 years. 
 
 Equity securities were 10.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 10.6 million at December 31, 2023. Equity securities are primarily comprised of an investment in a Small Business Administration Loan Fund. This investment is utilized by the Bank as part of its Community Reinvestment Act program.

 Loans held-for-investment, net, decreased by 139.7 million, or 3.3 , to 4.06 billion at September 30, 2024, from 4.20 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to decreases in multifamily, commercial, and one-to-four family residential real estate loans, partially offset by increases in home equity and lines of credit, construction and land, and commercial and industrial loans. The decrease in loan balances reflects the Company remaining strategically focused on both managing the concentration of its commercial and multifamily real estate loan portfolios and disciplined loan pricing, as well as lower customer demand in the recent elevated interest rate environment. Multifamily loans decreased 110.1 million, or 4.0 , to 2.64 billion at September 30, 2024, from 2.75 billion at December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans decreased 51.4 million, or 5.5 , to 878.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 929.6 million at December 31, 2023, one-to-four family residential loans decreased 11.1 million, or 6.9 , to 149.7 million at September 30, 2024, from 160.8 million at December 31, 2023, and other loans decreased 925,000, or 35.8 , to 1.7 million at September 30, 2024, from 2.6 million at December 31, 2023. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in commercial and industrial loans of 19.1 million, or 12.3 , to 174.4 million at September 30, 2024, from 155.3 million at December 31, 2023, home equity and lines of credit of 8.4 million, or 5.2 , to 171.9 million at September 30, 2024, from 163.5 million at December 31, 2023, and construction and land loans of 2.1 million, or 6.6 , to 33.0 million at September 30, 2024, from 31.0 million at December 31, 2023.

 The Company obtains an appraisal of the real estate collateral securing a commercial real estate loan prior to originating the loan. The appraised value is used to calculate the ratio of the outstanding loan balance to the value of the real estate collateral, or loan-to-value ratio ("LTV"). The original appraisal is used to monitor the LTVs within the commercial real estate portfolio unless an updated appraisal is received, which may happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to payment delinquency, additional loan requests using the same collateral, and loan modifications. The following table presents the ranges in the LTVs of our commercial mortgage loans at September 30, 2024:

 As of September 30, 2024, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans (as defined by regulatory guidance) to total risk-based capital was estimated at approximately 447 . Management believes that the Bank maintains appropriate risk management practices including risk assessments, board-approved underwriting policies and related procedures, which include monitoring Bank portfolio performance, performing market analysis (economic and real estate), and stressing of the Bank s commercial real estate portfolio under severe, adverse economic conditions. Although management believes the Bank has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to manage its commercial real estate concentration risk, the Bank s regulators could require it to implement additional policies and procedures or could require it to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, which might adversely affect its loan originations, the Company's ability to pay dividends, and overall profitability.

 Our real estate portfolio includes credit risk exposure to loans collateralized by office buildings and multifamily properties in New York State subject to some form of rent regulation limiting rent increases for rent stabilized multifamily properties. At September 30, 2024, office-related loans represented 183.6 million, or 4.5 of our total loan portfolio, with an average balance of 1.7 million (although we have originated these type of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average) and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 59 . Approximately 41 were owner-occupied. The geographic locations of the properties collateralizing our office-related loans are: 50.7 in New York, 47.8 in New Jersey, and 1.5 in Pennsylvania. At September 30, 2024, our largest office-related loan had a principal balance of 90.0 million (with a net active principal balance for the Bank of 29.9 million as we have a 33.3 participation interest), was secured by an office facility located in Staten Island, New York, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. At September 30, 2024, multifamily loans that have some form of rent stabilization or rent control totaled approximately 447.5 million, or approximately 11 of our total loan portfolio, with an average balance of 1.7 million (although we have originated these type of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average) and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 51 . At September 30, 2024, our largest rent-regulated loan had a principal balance of 16.9 million, was secured by an apartment building located in Staten Island, New York, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. Management continues to closely monitor its office and rent-regulated portfolios. For further details on our rent-regulated multifamily portfolio see Asset Quality . 
 Purchased credit-deteriorated PCD loans totaled 9.3 million and 9.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of the remaining PCD loan balance consists of loans acquired as part of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transaction. The Company accreted interest income of 327,000 and 1.1 million attributable to PCD loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 325,000 and 1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. PCD loans had an allowance for credit losses of approximately 2.9 million at September 30, 2024. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans decreased to 35.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 37.5 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in loan balances and an improvement in the economic forecast within our CECL model. The decrease was partially offset by increases in quantitative reserves in the commercial and industrial and home equity and lines of credit loan portfolios due to an increase in non-performing loans in these categories and loan balances. 
 
 Total liabilities increased 132.3 million, or 2.7 , to 5.03 billion at September 30, 2024, from 4.90 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in borrowings of 131.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in total deposits of 2.9 million. Deposits decreased 2.9 million, or 0.1 , to 3.88 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits decreased by 17.9 million, or 17.9 , due to maturities that were replaced by borrowings. The Company routinely utilizes brokered deposits and borrowed funds to manage interest rate risk, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and funding needs related to loan originations and deposit activity. 
 Deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased 15.0 million, or 0.4 . The increase in deposits, excluding brokered deposits, was primarily attributable to increases of 80.9 million in time deposits, partially offset by decreases of 14.9 million in transaction accounts, 14.7 million in savings accounts, and 36.3 million in money market accounts. Growth in time deposits was attributable to the current interest rate environment and offering competitive interest rates to attract deposits. Estimated gross uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 were 1.71 billion. This total includes fully collateralized uninsured governmental deposits and intercompany deposits of 859.3 million, leaving estimated uninsured deposits of approximately 852.2 million, or 22.0 , of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, estimated uninsured deposits totaled 869.9 million, or 22.4 of total deposits. 
 Borrowed funds increased to 1.05 billion at September 30, 2024, from 920.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in borrowings for the period was primarily due to a 205.5 million increase in borrowings under the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program, which included favorable terms and conditions as compared to FHLB advances. In January 2024, the Company borrowed 300.0 million from the Federal Reserve Bank through the Bank Term Funding Program at favorable terms and conditions and invested the proceeds in higher-yielding interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and investment securities. Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity, and to a lesser extent from time to time, as part of leverage strategies.

 Total stockholders equity increased by 119,000 to 699.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 699.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable to net income of 18.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 14.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, associated with an increase in the estimated fair value of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio due to the increase in market interest rates, and a 1.9 million increase in equity award activity, partially offset by 18.4 million in stock repurchases and 16.5 million in dividend payments. On April 24, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a 5.0 million stock repurchase program, which was completed in May 2024, and on June 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a 10.0 million stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.8 million of its common stock outstanding at an average price of 10.03 for a total of 18.1 million pursuant to the approved stock repurchase programs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no remaining capacity under its current repurchase program. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income . Net income was 18.7 million and 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a 10.9 million decrease in net interest income, a 1.3 million increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, a 1.5 million increase in non-interest income, a 3.2 million increase in non-interest expense, and a 3.1 million decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 Interest Income . Interest income increased 23.9 million, or 15.5 , to 178.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 154.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 47 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets due to the recent rising rate environment and a 156.1 million, or 2.9 , increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of 111.7 million, the average balance of other securities of 91.6 million, and the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of 88.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans of 133.4 million. The Company accreted interest income related to PCD loans of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of 648,000 as compared to 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense increased 34.8 million, or 59.4 , to 93.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 58.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of 28.3 million, or 88.7 , and, to a lesser extent, an increase in interest expense on borrowings of 6.5 million, or 26.8 . The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributable to a 114 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 1.42 to 2.56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the recent rising market interest rates and a shift in the composition of the deposit portfolio towards higher-costing certificates of deposit, and a 127.1 million, or 4.2 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was attributable to a 31 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings from 3.58 to 3.89 , and a 149.8 million, or 16.6 , increase in the average balance of borrowings.

Table of Contents 

 Net Interest Income . Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 10.9 million, or 11.4 , to 84.8 million, from 95.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 34 basis point decrease in net interest margin to 2.07 from 2.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to interest-bearing liabilities repricing at a faster rate than interest-earning assets. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 96 basis points to 2.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a 114 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 1.42 to 2.56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a 31 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings from 3.58 to 3.89 due to rising market interest rates and a shift in the composition of the deposit portfolio towards higher-costing certificates of deposit and a greater reliance on borrowings. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, which increased by 47 basis points to 4.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in yields on all classes of interest-earning assets due to the higher interest rate environment. The net interest margin was also negatively affected by approximately 12 basis points due to a low risk leverage strategy in the first quarter of 2024. In January 2024, the Company borrowed 300.0 million from the Federal Reserve Bank through the Bank Term Funding Program at favorable terms and conditions and invested the proceeds in higher-yielding interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and investment securities. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses . The provision for credit losses on loans increased by 1.3 million to 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the specific reserve component of the allowance for credit losses, which was partially offset by a decrease in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the specific reserve was related to a single commercial and industrial relationship totaling 12.5 million that experienced credit deterioration and was placed on non-accrual status during the current quarter, which has a specific reserve of 1.3 million and incurred a charge-off of 878,000. The decline in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses resulted from a decline in loan balances and an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the current period within our CECL model, partially offset by an increase in reserves related to changes in model assumptions, including the slowing of prepayment speeds, and an increase in reserves in the commercial and industrial and home equity and lines of credit portfolios related to an increase in non-performing loans in these portfolios and higher loan balances. Net charge-offs were 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to 3.9 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured commercial and industrial loans, as compared to net charge-offs of 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 5.2 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Management continues to closely monitor the small business unsecured commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which totaled 31.0 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-interest Income . Non-interest income increased by 1.5 million, or 18.7 , to 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of 790,000 in fees and service charges for customer services, related to an increase in overdraft fees and service charges on deposit accounts, 260,000 in income on bank owned life insurance, and 874,000 in gains on trading securities, net. Partially offsetting the increases was a 303,000 decrease in other income, primarily due to lower swap fee income. Gains on trading securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 1.6 million, as compared to 723,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company s deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the plan. The participants of this plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company s obligations under the plan.

 Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense increased 3.2 million, or 5.2 , to 65.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 62.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 3.3 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, primarily attributable to higher salary expense, related to annual merit increases and higher medical expense, and an increase of 874,000 in deferred compensation expense, which is described above, and had no effect on net income. Employee compensation and benefits expense also includes severance expense of 683,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 440,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, due to current economic conditions, the Company implemented a workforce reduction plan which included modest layoffs and staffing realignments. The annual estimated cost savings of this plan is 2.0 million, pre-tax. Partially offsetting the increase was a 461,000 decrease in stock compensation expense related to performance stock awards not expected to vest. Additionally, non-interest expense included a 727,000 increase in credit loss expense/(benefit) for off-balance sheet exposure due to a provision of 337,000 recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a benefit of 390,000 for the comparative prior year period. The benefit in the prior year period was attributable to a decrease in the pipeline of loans committed and awaiting closing. Partially offsetting the increases was a 552,000 decrease in advertising expense due to a change in marketing strategy and the timing of specific deposit and lending campaigns. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company recorded income tax expense of 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the decrease due to lower taxable income partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 29.7 compared to 27.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In June 2024, options granted in 2014 expired and resulted in additional tax expense of 795,000, contributing to the higher effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the quarter the Company entered into an agreement to sell and vacate one of its branches in New York with a closing date of December 27, 2024. The Company expects to record a gain on sale of property of approximately 3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income. Net income was 6.5 million and 8.2 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year quarter are as follows: a 1.5 million decrease in net interest income, a 2.4 increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, a 1.5 million increase in non-interest income, a 189,000 decrease in non-interest expense, and a 513,000 decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 Interest Income . Interest income increased 6.6 million, or 12.5 , to 59.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 52.7 million for the quarter September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 38 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets due to the rising rate environment and a 155.1 million, or 3.0 , increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was due to increases in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of 240.3 million, the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of 26.8 million, and the average balance of other securities of 64.0 million, partially offset by decreases in the average balance of loans outstanding of 172.8 million and the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock of 3.2 million. Interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of 87,000, as compared to 183,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company accreted interest income related to PCD loans of 327,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 325,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense increased 8.0 million, or 34.9 , to 31.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 23.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributed to an increase in interest expense on deposits of 6.7 million, or 49.1 , and to a lesser extent, an increase in interest expense on borrowings of 1.4 million, or 15.8 . The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily attributable to a 77 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 2.59 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 1.82 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, due to rising market interest rates and a shift in the composition of the deposit portfolio towards higher-yielding certificates of deposit and a 158.4 million, or 5.3 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was primarily due to a 30 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings from 3.63 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to 3.93 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and a 68.4 million, or 7.28 , increase in the average balance of borrowed funds. 
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.5 million, or 4.9 , to 28.2 million, from 29.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 17 basis point decrease in net interest margin to 2.08 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 2.25 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing faster than the repricing of interest-earning assets. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 64 basis points to 2.95 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 2.31 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by a 77 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 1.82 to 2.59 , and a 30 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings from 3.63 to 3.93 . The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, which increased by 38 basis points to 4.38 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 4.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses . The provision for credit losses on loans increased by 2.4 million to 2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from a provision of 188,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the specific reserve component of the allowance for credit losses, which was partially offset by a decrease in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the specific reserve was related to a single commercial and industrial relationship that experienced credit deterioration and was placed on non-accrual status during the current quarter, which has a specific reserve of 1.3 million and incurred a charge-off of 878,000. The decline in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses resulted from a decline in loan balances and an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the current period within our CECL model, partially offset by an increase in reserves related to changes in model assumptions, including the slowing of prepayment speeds, and an increase in reserves in the commercial and industrial portfolio related to an increase in non-performing loans and higher loan balances. Net charge-offs were 2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and included 1.4 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured loans, as compared to net charge-offs of 2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, due to 2.9 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured commercial and industrial loans.

 Non-interest Income . Non-interest income increased by 1.5 million, or 68.7 , to 3.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 294,000 increase in fees and service charges, primarily related to higher overdraft fees, a 1.0 million increase in gains on trading securities, net, and a 185,000 increase in other income, primarily due to higher swap fee income. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gains on trading securities, net, were 710,000, compared to losses of 295,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company s obligations under its deferred compensation plan. 
 
 Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense decreased by 189,000, or 0.9 , to 20.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 20.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of 386,000 in occupancy expense, attributable to lower real estate taxes, common area maintenance and electricity costs, 214,000 in data processing costs, attributable to a decrease in ongoing core processing costs related to a prior technology-related contract renewed at favorable terms, and 132,000 in advertising expense. Partially offsetting the decreases was a 504,000 increase in compensation and employee benefits, which included a 1.0 million increase in expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, which is described above, and had no effect on net income, that was offset by lower medical expense. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company recorded income tax expense of 2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, with the decrease due to lower taxable income. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 26.6 , compared to 26.0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

 PCD Loans (Held-for-Investment) 
 
 The Company accounts for PCD loans at estimated fair value using discounted expected future cash flows deemed to be collectible on the date acquired. Based on its detailed review of PCD loans and experience in loan workouts, management has a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of future cash flows and accordingly has classified PCD loans 9.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 9.9 million at December 31, 2023, respectively) as accruing, even though they may be contractually past due. At September 30, 2024, 2.1 of PCD loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 24.6 were past due 90 days or more, as compared to 2.9 and 27.1 , respectively, at December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 The Company's non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 totaled 30.4 million, or 0.75 , of total loans, and include 4.9 million of loans held-for-sale, as compared to non-performing loans of 11.4 million, or 0.27 , at December 31, 2023. The 19.0 million increase in non-performing loans was primarily attributable to an increase in non-performing commercial and industrial loans of 15.6 million and an increase of 3.5 million in non-performing commercial real estate loans. One commercial and industrial relationship with a carrying balance of 12.5 million at September 30, 2024, experienced credit deterioration and was placed on non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2024. The Company anticipated the receipt of 10.0 million on October 31, 2024, which was not received. The loan is currently in the collection process which includes all legal remedies. The loan was individually evaluated for impairment, including the assets of the borrower and its guarantors, which resulted in a charge-off of 878,000 and a specific reserve provision of 1.3 million. Additionally, management evaluated the collateral from the Company and assets subject to personal guarantees and, based on current estimates, believes there is adequate collateral and assets to support the current value of the loan. Another commercial and industrial relationship with an outstanding balance of 750,000 is in the process of maturity extension. Additionally, there was an increase in non-performing unsecured small business loans. Unsecured small business loans totaled 31.0 million and 37.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management continues to closely monitor the small business unsecured commercial and industrial loan portfolio. 
 
 The increase in non-performing commercial real estate loans was primarily attributable to one loan with a balance of 4.4 million, which was put on non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2024. Based on the results of the impairment analysis for this loan, no impairment reserve was necessary as the loan is adequately covered by collateral (a private residence and retail property, both located in New Jersey), with aggregate appraised values totaling 8.7 million. The loan was transferred to held-for-sale as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no assets acquired through foreclosure. 
 
 Accruing Loans 30 to 89 Days Delinquent 
 
 Loans 30 to 89 days delinquent and on accrual status totaled 16.1 million and 8.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table sets forth delinquencies for accruing loans by type and by amount at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Held-for-investment Real estate loans: Multifamily 2,259 740 Commercial mortgage 5,689 1,010 One-to-four family residential 2,286 3,339 Home equity and lines of credit 1,369 817 Commercial and industrial loans 4,450 2,767 Other loans 4 10 Total delinquent accruing loans held-for-investment 16,057 8,683 
 
 The increase in multifamily delinquent loans was primarily due to two relationships totaling 1.5 million that made payments and became current subsequent to September 30, 2024. The increase in commercial real estate delinquent loans was primarily due to two participation loans totaling 5.6 million that matured and the lead bank is in the process of extending their maturity and are expected to become current in the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in commercial and industrial delinquent loans was primarily due to two loans to one borrower totaling 1.5 million which are in the process of collection, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in delinquencies in unsecured small business loans. 
 
 Subsequent to the quarter end, 1.1 million of home equity and lines of credit loans, 1.5 million of one-to-four family residential loans, and 1.5 million of commercial and industrial loans became current.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity . The objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to meet financial commitments and deposit withdrawals, to repay borrowings as they mature, and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. 
 The Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, borrowed funds, the proceeds from maturing securities and short-term investments, and to a lesser extent, proceeds from the sales of loans and securities, and wholesale borrowings. The scheduled amortization of loans and securities, as well as proceeds from borrowed funds, are predictable sources of funds. Other funding sources, however, such as deposit inflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY ), which provides an additional source of short-term and long-term funding. The Bank also has short-term borrowing capabilities with the FRB. On March 12, 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System created the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ), which aimed to enhance liquidity by allowing institutions to pledge certain securities at par value, and a pay a borrowing rate of ten basis points over the one-year overnight index swap rate. The BTFP was available to eligible U.S. federally insured depository institutions, with advances having a term of up to one year and no prepayment penalties. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowed 300.0 million under the BTFP. The BTFP ceased making new advances on March 11, 2024. The Bank s total short-term borrowed funds, excluding lease obligations, floating rate advances and an overnight line of credit, were 983 million at September 30, 2024, and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.92 . A total of 483.2 million of these borrowings will mature in less than one year. Short-term borrowed funds, excluding floating rate advances, were 853.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 On June 17, 2022, the Company issued 62.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating subordinated notes (the Notes ). The Notes are non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of June 30, 2032, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00 until June 30, 2027. From July 2027 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a level equal to the then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 200 basis points. 
 
 The Bank has the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLBNY of approximately 1.27 billion utilizing unencumbered securities of 571.5 million, loans of 699.3 million, and encumbered securities of 93,000 at September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Bank has remaining borrowing capacity utilizing encumbered securities through the FRB Discount Window of 25.0 million. The Bank expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business. 
 
 The Company has a diversified deposit base, and government deposits are collateralized by assets or letters of credit issued by the FHLBNY. Estimated gross uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 were 1.71 billion. This total includes fully collateralized uninsured governmental deposits and intercompany deposits of 859.3 million, leaving estimated net uninsured deposits of approximately 852.2 million, or 22.0 , of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, estimated net uninsured deposits totaled 869.9 million, or 22.4 of total deposits. 
 
 Northfield Bancorp, Inc. (standalone) is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay dividends, repurchase its stock, and for other corporate purposes. Northfield Bancorp, Inc.'s primary source of liquidity is dividend payments from the Bank. At September 30, 2024, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. (standalone) had liquid assets of 28.4 million. 
 
 Capital Resources . Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0 , and a 4.0 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 
 The federal banking agencies developed a Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies have approved 9 as the current minimum capital for the CBLR. Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp have elected to opt into the CBLR framework. The CBLR replaced the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 In the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not recorded in the financial statements. These transactions primarily relate to lending commitments. These arrangements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. 
 Commitments to fund unused lines of credit are agreements to lend additional funds to customers as long as there have been no violations of any of the conditions established in the agreements (original or restructured). Commitments to originate loans generally have a fixed expiration or other termination clauses, which may require payment of a fee. Since some of these loan commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. At September 30, 2024, the reserve for commitments to fund unused lines of credit recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities was 573,000. 
 
 For further information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations, see "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Management of Market Risk 
 General . A majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage-related securities and loans, generally have longer maturities than our liabilities, which consist primarily of deposits and borrowings. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy involves managing interest rate risk and limiting the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established a Management Asset-Liability Committee, comprised of our Senior Vice President SVP Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer, who chairs this Committee, our President Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Vice President EVP Chief Risk Officer, our EVP Chief Financial Officer, our EVP Chief Lending Officer, our EVP Chief Branch Administration, Deposit Operations Business Development Officer, and our SVP Director of Marketing, and other officers and staff as necessary or appropriate. This committee is responsible for, among other things, evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for recommending to the risk management committee of our Board of Directors the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. 
 
 We seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. As part of our ongoing asset-liability management, we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: 
 
 originating multifamily loans and commercial real estate loans that generally have shorter maturities than one-to-four family residential real estate loans and have higher interest rates that generally reset from five to ten years; 
 investing in investment grade corporate securities and mortgage-backed securities; and 
 obtaining general financing through lower-cost core deposits, brokered deposits, and longer-term FHLB advances and repurchase agreements. 
 Shortening the average term of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term assets, as well as originating loans with variable interest rates, helps to match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities better, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. 
 
 Net Portfolio Value Analysis . We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (net portfolio value or NPV ), would change in the event market interest rates change over an assumed range of rates. Our simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis to measure the interest rate sensitivity of our NPV. Depending on current market interest rates, we estimate the economic value of these assets and liabilities under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 
 Net Interest Income Analysis. In addition to NPV calculations, we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. In our model, we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve-month period. Depending on current market interest rates we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease of 100, 200, 300, or 400 basis points, which is based on the current interest rate environment. 
 
 The following tables set forth, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our calculation of the estimated changes in our NPV, NPV ratio, and percent change in net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands). Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit repricing characteristics, including decay rates, and correlations to movements in interest rates, and should not be relied on as indicative of actual results.

 At September 30, 2024, in the event of a 400 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience an 19.60 increase in estimated net portfolio value, a 2.07 increase in net interest income in year one, and a 11.68 decrease in net interest income in year two. In the event of a 400 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 8.80 decrease in estimated net portfolio value, a 13.17 decrease in net interest income in year one and an 1.77 increase in net interest income in year two. Our policies provide that, in the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less in interest rates, our net present value ratio should decrease by no more than 300 basis points and 10 , and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our net present value should decrease by no more than 475 basis points and 35 . In the event of a 200 basis point decrease or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 10 in year one and 20 in year two, and in the event of a 400 basis point increase or less, our projected net interest income should decrease by no more than 39 in year one and 26 in year two. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all Board-approved policies with respect to interest rate risk management. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income. Our model requires us to make certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. However, we also apply consistent parallel yield curve shifts (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve shifts occurred gradually. Net interest income analysis also adjusts the asset and liability repricing analysis based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts. In addition, the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net portfolio value or net interest income and will differ from actual results.
