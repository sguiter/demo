 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information for Purposes of the "Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
 
 Certain statements in this Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "could," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "would," "seeks," "approximately," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates," or the negative version of those words or other comparable words. Any forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are based upon current plans, estimates, expectations and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The inclusion of any forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the future plans, estimates, or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. Such forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those factors described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 (the "2023 Form 10-K"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 25, 2024, and otherwise in our reports and filings with the SEC, there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements that include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 uncertain general economic and financial conditions, including economic volatility, supply chain disruptions, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, fluctuating interest rates, inflationary pressures, and the related impacts to consumer discretionary spending, as well as our ability to plan for and respond to the impact of these conditions; 
 our ability to anticipate and respond to rapidly changing consumer preferences, seasonality, customer expectations, and fashion trends; 
 the impact on our consumer traffic and demand, our business operations, and the operations of our suppliers, as we experience unseasonable weather, climate change evolves, and the frequency and severity of weather events increase; 
 our ability to execute on our business strategies, including integrating and growing our Brand Portfolio segment, enhancing in-store and digital shopping experiences, and meeting consumer demands; 
 whether we will be able to successfully and efficiently integrate our recent acquisitions in a manner that does not impede growth; 
 our ability to maintain strong relationships with our vendors, manufacturers, licensors, and retailer customers; 
 risks related to losses or disruptions associated with our distribution systems, including our distribution centers and stores, whether as a result of reliance on third-party providers or otherwise; 
 risks related to cyber security threats and privacy or data security breaches or the potential loss or disruption of our information technology ("IT") systems, or those of our vendors; 
 risks related to the implementation of new or updated IT systems; 
 our ability to protect our reputation and to maintain the brands we license; 
 our reliance on our loyalty programs and marketing to drive traffic, sales, and customer loyalty; 
 our ability to successfully integrate new hires or changes in leadership and retain our existing management team, and to continue to attract qualified new personnel; 
 risks related to restrictions imposed by our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, as amended ("ABL Revolver"), and our senior secured term loan credit agreement, as amended ("Term Loan"), that could limit our ability to fund our operations; 
 our competitiveness with respect to style, price, brand availability, shopping platforms, and customer service; 
 risks related to our international operations and our reliance on foreign sources for merchandise; 
 our ability to comply with privacy laws and regulations, as well as other legal obligations; 
 risks associated with climate change and other corporate responsibility issues; and 
 uncertainties related to future legislation, regulatory reform, policy changes, or interpretive guidance on existing legislation. 
 
 If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements may vary materially from what we have projected. Furthermore, new factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can management assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

 reportable segments: the U.S. Retail segment, the Canada Retail segment, and the Brand Portfolio segment. The U.S. Retail segment operates the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse ("DSW") banner through its direct-to-consumer stores and e-commerce site in the United States ("U.S."). The Canada Retail segment operates The Shoe Co., DSW, and Rubino banners through its direct-to-consumer stores and e-commerce sites in Canada. The Brand Portfolio segment earns revenue from the wholesale of products to retailers and international distributors, the sale of our branded products through direct-to-consumer e-commerce for the Vince Camuto, Keds, and Topo brands, as well as from commissions for serving retailers as the design and buying agent for products under private labels. 
 
 We have a ownership interest in ABG-Camuto, LLC ("ABG-Camuto"), a joint venture that owns the intellectual property rights of Vince Camuto and other brands. We are party to a licensing agreement with ABG-Camuto, which provides for the exclusive right to design, source, and sell footwear and handbags under the brands that ABG-Camuto owns. We also have a ownership interest in Le Tigre 360 Global LLC ("Le Tigre"), which manages the Le Tigre brand, and are party to a license agreement with Le Tigre, which provides for the exclusive right to design, source, and sell Le Tigre-branded footwear. Our equity investments are an integral part of the Brand Portfolio segment. In addition, we own the licensing rights for footwear and handbags of the Lucky Brand and the licensing rights for footwear of the Jessica Simpson brand and the Hush Puppies brand. 
 
 On April 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Rubino Shoes Inc. ("Rubino"), a retailer of branded footwear, handbags, and accessories that operates Rubino banner stores and an e-commerce platform in Quebec, Canada. The acquisition of Rubino has allowed our Canada Retail segment to expand into the province of Quebec. 
 
 Basis of Presentation- The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, we do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. The balance sheet as of February 3, 2024 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

million and million, respectively, of CEO transition costs in operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. There are CEO transition costs for 2024. 
 
 Severance- During the three months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we incurred severance costs of million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we incurred severance costs, excluding the severance related to the CEO transition, of million and million, respectively. These costs are included in operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024, and October 28, 2023, we had million, million, and million, respectively, of severance liability included in accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets- During the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of million due to a vacated leased corporate office, million due to an underperforming Canada Retail segment store, and million due to an underperforming U.S. Retail segment store. During the nine months ended October 28, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of million primarily related to weather damage to a corporate office. 
 
 Impairment of Equity Investment- During the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of our ownership interest in Le Tigre of million, resulting in no remaining value due to the inability of Le Tigre to generate earnings with expected future losses. 
 
 and a positive , respectively, and for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, our effective tax rate was a negative and a positive , respectively. The negative effective tax rate for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 was due to discrete tax benefits recognized, primarily related to the release of tax reserves no longer deemed necessary and state tax planning initiatives, which partially offset the tax calculated on income before income taxes at statutory rates. The negative effective tax rate for the three months ended November 2, 2024 is the result of the change from a positive tax rate through the six months ended August 3, 2024 to a negative rate through the nine months ended November 2, 2024. The positive effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023 was higher than statutory rates due to the impact of permanent non-deductible compensation partially offset by federal and state valuation allowance adjustments.

Due from Seller for estimated contingent consideration ) Fair value of assets and liabilities acquired: Inventories Goodwill Intangible assets Accounts payable ) 
 
 The purchase price was subject to adjustments primarily based upon estimated contingent considerations as provided by the purchase agreement, which were based on recognized sales and incurred marketing costs for certain identified aged inventories. We recorded an estimated amount due from Seller at fair value based on our estimated probability of the conditions being met requiring payment. Changes to the estimated amount due from Seller after we have finalized the purchase price were recorded to earnings and were immaterial. 
 
 The fair value of inventories, which were made up of finished goods, was determined based on market assumptions for realizing a reasonable profit after selling costs. The fair value of the intangible assets relates to million of an indefinite-lived tradename and million of customer relationships, amortized over a useful life of years, and were based on the excess earnings method under the income approach with the relief from royalty method for the tradename. The fair value measurements were based on significant unobservable inputs, including discounted future cash flows, market-based assumed royalty rates, and customer attrition rates. The goodwill, included within the Brand Portfolio segment, represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to acquiring an established design and sourcing process for casual footwear, including kids' footwear, with international distribution. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The purchase price also included a contingent consideration with a maximum potential payment of million, subject to Rubino's achievement of a defined average annual financial performance target for the 24-month period following the acquisition. Based on Rubino's projected performance, we have estimated at fair value no contingent consideration to be recorded.

The goodwill, included within the Canada Retail segment, represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to acquiring an established retail banner in a province in Canada we did not previously have a presence in.

 million, including a Canadian sub-limit of up to million, a million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit, a million sub-limit for swing-loan advances for U.S. borrowings, and a million sub-limit for swing-loan advances for Canadian borrowings. In addition, the ABL Revolver includes a first-in last-out term loan ("FILO Term Loan") of up to million, which was drawn in full on February 28, 2023. The FILO Term Loan may be repaid in full, but not in part, so long as certain payment conditions are satisfied. Once repaid, no portion of the FILO Term Loan may be reborrowed. Our ABL Revolver matures in March 2027 and is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our personal property assets, including credit card receivables and inventory. The ABL Revolver may be used to provide funds for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, other expenditures, and permitted acquisitions as defined by the credit facility agreement. The amount of credit available is limited to a borrowing base formulated on, among other things, a percentage of the book value of eligible inventory and credit card receivables, as reduced by certain reserves. As of November 2, 2024, the revolving line of credit (excluding the FILO Term Loan) had a borrowing base of million, with million in outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit issued, resulting in million available for borrowings. 
 
 Borrowings under the revolving line of credit and letters of credit issued under the ABL Revolver accrue interest, at our option, at a rate equal to: (A) a base rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Fed Funds Rate (as defined in the credit facility agreement and subject to a floor of plus , and (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the credit facility agreement) plus ; or (B) a one-month, three-month, or six-month Adjusted Term SOFR per annum (subject to a floor of ), plus, in each instance, an applicable rate to be determined based on average availability. The FILO Term Loan accrues interest, at our option, at a rate equal to: (A) a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Fed Funds Rate plus , or (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR plus , plus ; or (B) Adjusted Term SOFR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus . Commitment fees are based on the unused portion of the ABL Revolver available for borrowings. Interest expense related to the ABL Revolver includes interest on borrowings and letters of credit, with an interest rat e of as of November 2, 2024, commitment fees, and the amortization of debt issuance costs. 
 
 TERM LOAN 
 
 On June 23, 2023, we entered into the Term Loan and have since borrowed the maximum aggregate amount of million during 2023, consisting of a million U.S. loan and a million Canadian loan (denominated in USD). The Term Loan matures at the earliest of the date the ABL Revolver matures (currently March 2027) or from closing of the Term Loan (June 2028). The Term Loan is collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all of our personal, real, and intellectual property and by a second priority lien on the assets used as collateral for the ABL revolver, primarily credit card receivables, accounts receivable, and inventory. 
 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a per annum rate equal to: (A) an adjusted three-month SOFR per annum (subject to a floor of ), plus ; or if (A) is not available, then (B) a base rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) , (ii) the prime rate, (iii) the Fed Funds Rate plus , and (iv) the Adjusted Term SOFR plus ; plus, in each instance, , with an interest rate of (effective interest rate of when including the amortization of debt issuance costs) as of November 2, 2024.

:1 when availability is less than the greater of million or of the maximum borrowing amount. At any time that liquidity is less than million, the Term Loan requires a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal month, calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, of (1) to 1.00 for any trailing twelve-month period through February 3, 2024, and (2) to 1.00 thereafter. Testing of the consolidated net leverage ratio ends after liquidity has been greater than or equal to million for a period of consecutive days. The ABL Revolver and the Term Loan also contain customary covenants restricting certain activities, including limitations on our ability to sell assets, engage in acquisitions, enter into transactions involving related parties, incur additional debt, grant liens on assets, pay dividends or repurchase stock, and make certain other changes. There are specific exceptions to these covenants including, in some cases, upon satisfying specified payment conditions based on availability. The ABL Revolver and the Term Loan contain customary events of default, including failure to comply with certain financial and other covenants. Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within the cure periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders, our obligations may be accelerated, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized, and remedies may be exercised against the collateral. As of November 2, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the ABL Revolver and the Term Loan.

GUARANTEE 
 
 We provide a guarantee for a lease obligation that is scheduled to expire in 2027 for a location that has been leased to a third party. If the third party does not pay the rent or vacate the premises, we may be required to make full rent payments to the landlord. As of November 2, 2024, the total future payments for the guarantee were approximately million.

 Beginning in 2024, we changed how the Brand Portfolio segment sources certain Owned Brands for the U.S. Retail segment by transacting using a wholesale model, where intersegment sales and cost of sales are recorded, whereas in 2023 and prior we transacted on a commission model, where intersegment sales were based on a percentage of product cost. This change results in an increase in Brand Portfolio intersegment net sales, cost of sales, and gross profit and a corresponding increase in the amount of eliminated intersegment net sales, cost of sales, and gross profit with no impact to consolidated net sales, cost of sales, and gross profit.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, net sales decreased 1.2 and total comparable sales decreased 3.1 compared to the same period last year impacted by unseasonably warm weather and sustained uncertainty in the macro economic environment. During the third quarter of 2024, net sales from Owned Brands represented 25.1 of consolidated net sales, down from 27.5 for the same period last year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter of 2024 was 31.8 , which was 80 basis points lower when compared to the same period last year.

 EFFECTS OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, our comparable sales declined as we experienced lower traffic, primarily in the U.S. Retail segment. Consumer spending on discretionary items, including our products, generally declines during periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced, or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence. We believe the decrease in comparable sales is a result of ongoing consumer concern of negative and/or uncertain economic conditions, most notably the concern of economic volatility, fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures, and changes in employment levels. We are unable to predict the severity of macroeconomic uncertainty, whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or the full impact such circumstances could have on our business. These factors ultimately could require us to enact further mitigating operating efficiency measures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and results of operations. 
 
 FINANCIAL SUMMARY AND OTHER KEY METRICS 
 
 For the three months ended November 2, 2024: 
 Net sales decreased to 777.2 million from 786.3 million for the same period last year. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 31.8 compared to 32.6 for the same period last year. 
 Net income attributable to Designer Brands Inc. was 13.0 million, or 0.24 per diluted share, compared to 10.1 million, or 0.17 per diluted share. 
 
 Comparable Sales Performance Metric- The following table presents the percent change in comparable sales for each segment and in total: 
 Three months ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Change in comparable sales: U.S. Retail segment (2.8) (9.8) Canada Retail segment (4.6) (7.7) Brand Portfolio segment - direct-to-consumer channel (7.5) 7.0 Total (3.1) (9.3)

Table of contents 

We consider the percent change in comparable sales from the same previous year period, a primary metric commonly used throughout the retail industry, to be an important measurement for management and investors of the performance of our direct-to-consumer businesses. We include in our comparable sales metric sales from stores in operation for at least 14 months at the beginning of the applicable year. Stores are added to the comparable base at the beginning of the year and are dropped for comparative purposes in the quarter in which they are closed. Comparable sales include the e-commerce sales of the U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments. For calculating comparable sales in 2024, periods in 2023 are shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. Comparable sales for the Canada Retail segment exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rate used in the comparable period of the prior year. Stores added as a result of the Rubino acquisition that will have been in operation for at least 14 months at the beginning of 2025, along with its e-commerce sales, will be added to the comparable base for the Canada Retail segment beginning with the second quarter of 2025. Comparable sales include the e-commerce net sales of the Brand Portfolio segment from the direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites. The calculation of comparable sales varies across the retail industry and, as a result, the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation. 
 
 Number of Stores- As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we had the following number of stores: 
 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 U.S. Retail segment - DSW stores 496 499 Canada Retail segment: The Shoe Co. stores 125 119 DSW stores 26 25 Rubino stores 28 179 144 Total number of stores 675 643

 NET SALES 
 
 The following table summarizes net sales by segment: 
 Three months ended (dollars in thousands) November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Change Amount of Segment Net Sales Amount of Segment Net Sales Amount Comparable Sales Segment net sales: U.S. Retail 615,495 75.9 631,610 78.8 (16,115) (2.6) (2.8) Canada Retail 83,504 10.3 75,610 9.5 7,894 10.4 (4.6) Brand Portfolio 111,492 13.8 94,057 11.7 17,435 18.5 (7.5) Total segment net sales 810,491 100.0 801,277 100.0 9,214 1.1 (3.1) Elimination of intersegment net sales (33,297) (14,948) (18,349) 122.8 Consolidated net sales 777,194 786,329 (9,135) (1.2) 
 
 For the three months ended November 2, 2024 , net sales decreased in the U.S. Retail segment primarily driven by the decrease in comparable sales of 17.4 million. The decrease in comparable sales for the U.S. Retail segment was largely driven by a decrease in comparable transactions of approximately 4 due to lower traffic, partially offset by higher comparable average sales amounts per transaction of approximately 1 . Net sales increased in the Canada Retail segment primarily due to the addition of Rubino, with 8.1 million of net sales in the quarter, as well as 2.2 million from the net new stores opened since the end of the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decrease in comparable sales due to lower comparable average sales amounts per transaction. Unseasonably warm weather impacted boot sales during the fall season and contributed to the decrease in comparable sales in the Canada Retail segment. The increase in net sales for the Brand Portfolio segment was primarily due to a change in how we source certain Owned Brands for the U.S. Retail segment from a commission model, where sales were based on a percentage of product cost, to a wholesale model, where sales and cost of sales are recorded, which also resulted in the increase in intersegment net sales that are eliminated.

 The decrease in gross profit for the U.S. Retail segment was primarily driven by the decrease in net sales during the three months ended November 2, 2024 over the same period last year and at lower margin rates. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased for the U.S. Retail segment, when compared to the same period last year, primarily due to a change in mix of products sold as we continued to expand our athletic and casual offerings, which have lower margins than the seasonal and dress categories. The increase in gross profit for the Canada Retail segment was primarily driven by the increase in net sales during the three months ended November 2, 2024 over the same period last year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased for the Canada Retail segment also due to a change in mix of products sold. T he increase in gross profit for the Brand

 Portfolio segment was primarily driven by the transition of certain Owned Brands sourced for the U.S. Retail segment under a wholesale model, as discussed above, partially offset by higher freight costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased for the Brand Portfolio segment due t o higher freight costs compared to the same period last year as we rerouted supply chain lanes in order to avoid potential disruptions, p artially offset by the benefits from the transition of certain Owned Brands sourced for the U.S. Retail segment under a wholesale model and the leverage of higher sales on royalty expense for products that do not have a royalty obligation. 
 
 The net recognition of intersegment gross profit consisted of the following: 
 Three months ended (in thousands) November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Intersegment recognition and elimination activity: Elimination of net sales recognized by Brand Portfolio segment (33,297) (14,948) Cost of sales: Elimination of cost of sales recognized by Brand Portfolio segment 23,823 9,857 Recognition of intersegment gross profit for inventory previously purchased that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period 10,411 5,969 937 878 
 
 OPERATING EXPENSES 
 
 For the three months ended November 2, 2024, operating expenses decreased by 20.3 million over the same period last year, driven by a decrease in marketing expense of 8.7 million and a decrease in incentive compensation of 9.1 million as we have reversed incentive compensation recognized in previous quarters based on the performance of the business relative to our targets. Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 230 basis points over the same period last year due to a larger decrease in operating expenses on lower sales. 
 
 IMPAIRMENT CHARGES 
 
 During the three months ended November 2, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of 17.8 million with 9.2 million due to a vacated leased corporate office, 1.0 million due to an underperforming Canada Retail segment store, 0.6 million due to an underperforming U.S. Retail segment store, and 7.0 million due to the write-off of our equity investment in Le Tigre due to the inability of Le Tigre to generate earnings with expected future losses. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
 
 For the three months ended November 2, 2024, interest expense, net, increased by 2.8 million over the same period last year primarily driven by a higher average debt balance. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 For the three months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, our effective tax rate was a negative 20.2 and a positive 46.8 , respectively. The negative effective tax rate for the three months ended November 2, 2024 is the result of the change from a positive tax rate through the six months ended August 3, 2024 to a negative rate through the nine months ended November 2, 2024. The positive effective tax rate for the three months ended October 28, 2023 was higher than statutory rates due to the impact of permanent non-deductible compensation partially offset by federal and state valuation allowance adjustments.

 For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, net sales decreased in the U.S. Retail segment primarily driven by the decrease in comparable sales of 38.9 million, partially offset by the added net sales due to the calendar shift in 2024 as a result of 2023 containing an additional week. The decrease in comparable sales for the U.S. Retail segment was driven by a decrease in comparable average sales amounts per transaction of 1 due to lower units per transaction with the remaining decrease due to lower traffic. Net sales increased in the Canada Retail segment due to the addition of Rubino, with 15.6 million of net sales during the period, as well as 5.6 million from the net new stores opened since the end of the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the decrease in comparable sales due to lower comparable transactions and average sales amounts per transaction. The increase in net sales for the Brand Portfolio segment was primarily due to a change in how we source certain Owned Brands for the U.S. Retail segment from a commission model, where sales are based on a percentage of product cost, to a wholesale model, where sales and cost of sales are recorded, which also resulted in the increase in intersegment net sales that are eliminated. This increase in the Brand Portfolio segment was partially offset by lower sales to external customers as retail customers pulled back on orders during 2024.

 For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, operating expenses increased by 10.5 million over the same period last year, due to the addition of Rubino, with 3.9 million of operating expenses during the period, and the remaining increase primarily due to restructuring and integration costs and professional fees related to certain strategic initiative work. Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased 80 basis points over the same period last year due to an increase in operating expenses on lower sales. 
 
 IMPAIRMENT CHARGES 
 
 During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of 17.8 million with 9.2 million due to a vacated leased corporate office, 1.0 million due to an underperforming Canada Retail segment store, 0.6 million due to an underperforming U.S. Retail segment store, and 7.0 million due to the write-off of our equity investment in Le Tigre due to the inability of Le Tigre to generate earnings with expected future losses. During the nine months ended October 28, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 0.6 million, primarily related to weather damage to a corporate office. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
 
 For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, interest expense, net, increased by 11.9 million over the same period last year primarily driven by a higher average debt balance. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 For the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, our effective tax rate was a negative 7.9 and a positive 31.8 , respectively. The negative effective tax rate for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 was due to discrete tax benefits recognized, primarily related to the release of tax reserves no longer deemed necessary and state tax planning initiatives, which partially offset the tax calculated on income before income taxes at statutory rates. The positive effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 28, 2023 was higher than statutory rates due to the impact of permanent non-deductible compensation partially offset by federal and state valuation allowance adjustments. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Our primary ongoing operating cash flow requirements are for inventory purchases, payments on lease obligations and licensing royalty commitments, other working capital needs, c apital expenditures, and debt service. Our working capital and inventory levels fluctuate seasonally. On April 8, 2024, we acquired Rubino for 16.1 million in cash, funded with available 
 26 

Table of contents 

 cash and borrowings on the ABL Revolver. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, we repurchased 10.3 million Class A common shares at an aggregate cost of 68.6 million. As of November 2, 2024, 19.7 million of Class A common shares remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program. 
 
 We are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operation of the business, pursue our growth strategy, and withstand unanticipated business volatility, including the impacts of the global economic conditions on our results of operations. We believe that cash generated from our operations, together with our current levels of cash, as well as the availability under our ABL Revolver, are sufficient to maintain our ongoing operations, support seasonal working capital requirements, fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase common shares under our share repurchase program, and meet our debt service obligations over the next 12 months and beyond. 
 
 The following table presents the key categories of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows: 
 Nine months ended (in thousands) November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 12,137 202,521 (190,384) Net cash used in investing activities (50,692) (169,811) 119,119 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 26,155 (36,098) 62,253 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances (546) (740) 194 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (12,946) (4,128) (8,818) 
 
 OPERATING CASH FLOWS 
 
 The decrease in net cash provided by operations was largely driven by higher spend on working capital as we increased our investment in inventories and the decrease in net income recognized after adjusting for non-cash activity, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation activity, and impairment charges, partially offset by the receipt of income tax refunds of over 40.0 million and no incentive compensation for 2023 being paid in the first quarter of 2024 whereas we did pay incentive compensation for 2022 in the first quarter of 2023. Other changes in working capital were the result of timing of payments with the calendar shift. 
 
 INVESTING CASH FLOWS 
 For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to capital expenditures of 38.9 million relating to infrastructure and IT projects and new stores, including relocations, and the acquisition of the Rubino business for 16.1 million. For the nine months ended October 28, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of Keds for 127.3 million and capital expenditures of 42.3 million relating to infrastructure and IT projects, new stores, and store improvements. 
 
 FINANCING CASH FLOWS 
 
 For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net receipts of 113.0 million from our ABL Revolver, partially offset by the repurchase of 10.3 million Class A common shares at an aggregate cost of 68.6 million, and payments of 8.1 million for dividends and 4.3 million for taxes for stock-based compensation shares withheld. For the nine months ended October 28, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 9.7 million Class A common shares at an aggregate cost of 102.1 million, payments of 15.7 million for taxes for stock-based compensation shares withheld, and payments of dividends of 9.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan of 50.0 million and net receipts of 49.5 million from our ABL Revolver. 
 
 DEBT 
 
 ABL Revolver- The ABL Revolver provides a revolving line of credit of up to 600.0 million, including a Canadian sub-limit of up to 60.0 million, a 75.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit, a 60.0 million sub-limit for swing-loan advances for U.S. borrowings, and a 6.0 million sub-limit for swing-loan advances for Canadian borrowings. In addition, the ABL Revolver includes a FILO Term Loan of up to 30.0 million. The FILO Term Loan may be repaid in full, but not in part, so long as certain payment conditions are satisfied. Once repaid, no portion of the FILO Term Loan may be reborrowed. The ABL Revolver, which matures in 2027, may be used to provide funds for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, other expenditures, and permitted acquisitions as defined by the credit facility agreement. The amount of credit 
 27 

Table of contents 

 available is limited to a borrowing base formulated on, among other things, a percentage of the book value of eligible inventory and credit card receivables, as reduced by certain reserves. As of November 2, 2024, the revolving line of credit (excluding the FILO Term Loan) had a borrowing base of 506.8 million, with 384.1 million in outstanding borrowings and 4.4 million in letters of credit issued, resulting in 118.3 million available for borrowings. 
 
 Term Loan- On June 23, 2023, we entered into a Term Loan and have since borrowed the maximum aggregate of 135.0 million. The Term Loan matures at the earliest of the date the ABL Revolver matures (currently March 2027) or five years from closing of the Term Loan (June 2028). 
 
 Debt Covenants- The ABL Revolver required us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of not less than 1:1 when availability is less than the greater of 47.3 million or 10.0 of the maximum borrowing amount. At any time that liquidity is less than 100.0 million, the Term Loan requires a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal month, calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, of (1) 2.25 to 1.00 for any trailing twelve-month period through February 3, 2024, and (2) 2.50 to 1.00 thereafter. Testing of the consolidated net leverage ratio ends after liquidity has been greater than or equal to 100.0 million for a period of 45 consecutive days. The ABL Revolver and the Term Loan also contain customary covenants restricting certain activities, including limitations on our ability to sell assets, engage in acquisitions, enter into transactions involving related parties, incur additional debt, grant liens on assets, pay dividends or repurchase stock, and make certain other changes. There are specific exceptions to these covenants including, in some cases, upon satisfying specified payment conditions based on availability. As of November 2, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the ABL Revolver and the Term Loan. 
 
 Refer to Note 10, Debt , of the condensed consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further information about our debt arrangements. 
 
 PLANS FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS 
 
 During 2024, we expect to spend approximately 60.0 million to 65.0 million that will be capitalized for property and equipment and implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements accounted for as service contracts, 46.5 million of which was spent during the nine months ended November 2, 2024. Our future investments will depend primarily on the number of stores we open and remodel, infrastructure and IT projects that we undertake, and the timing of these expenditures. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 The information related to recent accounting pronouncements as set forth in Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements , of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and judgments on factors we believe to be relevant, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, actuarial and valuation techniques. We constantly re-evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate. While we believe that the factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate. As the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the application of critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. There have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.
