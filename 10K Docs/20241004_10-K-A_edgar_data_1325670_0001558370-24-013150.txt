 PART I Item 1. Business Overview Primis Financial Corp. Primis, we, us, our or the Company is the bank holding company for Primis Bank Primis Bank or the Bank ), a Virginia state-chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Primis Bank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. As of December 31, 2022, Primis had 3.6 billion in total assets, 2.9 billion in total loans, 2.7 billion in total deposits and 389.0 million in total stockholders equity. At December 31, 2022, Primis Bank had thirty-two full-service branches in Virginia and Maryland and also provides services to customers through certain online and mobile applications. Thirty full-service retail branches are in Virginia and two full-service retail branches are in Maryland. The Company is headquartered in McLean, Virginia and has administrative offices in Tysons Corner, Virginia and Glen Allen, Virginia and an operations center in Atlee, Virginia. Our deposits are insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ). Primis Bank also owns Primis Mortgage Company, a residential mortgage lender. We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act available free of charge on our website at www.primisbank.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the SEC. These reports are also available without charge on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Strategy Primis is focused on building a new, innovative, and better banking experience for its consumers and small and medium-sized businesses. The bank intends to grow its business, expand its customer base and improve profitability. This is being achieved through a seven-pronged approach: 1. Ensuring deposit and lending products are competitive, easy to understand and readily accessible; 2. Developing business and cash management services that are robust and easy to use; 3. Supporting lines of business that offer differentiable value to consumers and businesses; 4. Executing intuitive, forward-thinking and pioneering electronic banking services that go beyond merely providing access to finances 24-hours a day, 7-days a week; 5. Maintaining a relationship-oriented and needs-based approach to banking; 6. Providing employees with resources for personal and professional development; and, 7. Providing Primis communities and the people within them purposeful and meaningful financial support and volunteerism. Critical to executing this approach: Utilizing the Primis Management Team s Strength . The experience and market knowledge of the Bank s management team is one of its greatest strengths and competitive advantages. Since the Company s board of directors appointed Mr. Dennis J. Zember, Jr. as the new president and chief executive officer, effective February 19, 2020, Mr. Zember has added several members to the executive management team. These additional members all bring strong expertise and years of experience. Leveraging the Existing Foundation for Additional Growth. Based on the management team s depth of experience and certain infrastructure investments, Primis looks to take advantage of certain economies of scale typically enjoyed by larger organizations, thus expanding its operations both organically and through strategic cost-effective branch or bank acquisitions. Primis investments in data processing, risk management infrastructure,

Table of Contents 
 and the staff and branch network will support a much larger asset base. Primis is committed to controlling additional growth in a manner designed to minimize risk and to maintain strong capital ratios. Continuing to Pursue Selective Acquisition Opportunities . Primis has the skillsets and experience necessary to acquire and successfully integrate financial institutions, banks and branches. This, along with its strong capital position, well-positions Primis to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. Focusing on the Business Owner . Primis looks to be the primary bank for small- and medium-sized businesses by offering a suite of competitive electronic banking services, robust treasury services and comprehensive lending options. We believe that Primis localized decision-making capabilities, prompt credit decisions, and superior customer service, supported by a highly experienced and knowledgeable management team, offers Primis a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace. Focusing on Asset Quality and Underwriting . Strong asset quality is of primary importance. Therefore, despite the growth in the Bank s loan portfolio, Primis has taken measures to ensure it maintains a strong asset quality by upholding its well-defined underwriting standards. Building a Stable Core Deposit Base . Primis continues to grow a stable core deposit base of business and retail customers. Primis intends to continue its practice of developing a deposit relationship with each of its loan customers. 
 BANKING SERVICES Our principal business is the acquisition of deposits from the general public through our branch offices and deposit intermediaries and the use of these deposits to fund our loan and investment security portfolios. We seek to be a full service bank that provides a wide variety of financial services to our middle market corporate clients as well as to our retail clients. We are an active commercial lender, and also invest funds in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, securities issued by agencies of the federal government and obligations of states and political subdivisions. Lending Activities Overview Primis offers a wide range of commercial banking services; however, we are focused on making loans secured primarily by commercial real estate and other types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a number of industries, as well as loans to individuals for a variety of purposes, including home equity lines of credit. We are a Small Business Administration SBA lender with Preferred Lending Partner PLP status that allows us to offer this program nationwide. We also invest in real estate-related securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage backed securities. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investing in securities are deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings. The following is a discussion of each of the major types of lending in which we engage. For more information on our lending activities, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. Commercial Lending Commercial Business Lending. These loans consist of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term loans, equipment loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit, and unsecured loans. Commercial business loans are generally secured by business assets, equipment, accounts receivable, inventory and other collateral, such as readily marketable stocks and bonds with adequate margins, cash value in life insurance policies and savings and time deposits at Primis Bank. Commercial Real Estate Lending. Commercial real estate lending includes loans for permanent financing. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of loans is dependent, in large part,

Table of Contents 
 on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Owner occupied real estate is evaluated in conjunction with the operations of the business. Construction Lending. Primis provides construction loans for commercial, multi-family, assisted living and other non-residential properties, and builder/developer lines for established companies in our market footprint. Construction loan borrowers are generally pre-qualified for the permanent loan by us or a third party. Secured Asset Based Lending (SABL). Primis has developed a proprietary Asset Based Lending software system that allows the Bank to monitor the collateral of its commercial borrowers who have pledged their working assets (accounts receivables and other qualifying assets such as inventory) as collateral. SABL has the ability to track other offsets (liabilities, e.g. other loans the customer has with the Bank) to the line of credit. SABL serves to provide more stringent controls and supervision that this type of lending requires. SBA Lending. Primis has developed expertise in the federally guaranteed SBA programs. The SBA programs provide economic development programs which finance start-up and expansion of small businesses. We are a nationwide Preferred Lender. As an SBA Preferred Lender, our pre-approved status allows us to quickly respond to customers needs. Under the SBA program, we generally originate and fund SBA 7(a) and 504 loans. Benefits to Primis are low LTV commercial loans and government guarantees up to 80 . Panacea Practice Solutions. Primis, through its Panacea division, provides financing for medical, dental and veterinary businesses. Financing purposes cover a range of needs in this sector to include acquisition, start-up, expansion, real estate purchase and refinance, leasehold, equipment financing, as well as practice buy-ins. Mortgage Warehouse Lending. Primis provides warehouse lending lines of credit to residential mortgage originators. Program parameters and underwriting guidelines are processed and monitored through our Warehouse Loan System (WLS) to ensure program compliance. Consumer Lending Primis offers various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans. We make consumer loans primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Residential Mortgage. Primis originates residential mortgage loans for its portfolio through Primis Mortgage Company. Primis also purchases originated residential mortgages from our Warehouse Line clients, as well as other loan pools. We have no sub-prime loans. Home Equity Lines of Credit. Primis offers credit lines secured by primary residential properties with maximum loan-to-values of 80 . The product provides for a 10 year draw period followed by a 20 year repayment period. Secured Personal Loans. Primis offers secured personal loans for a variety of purposes including auto, motorcycle, boats, and recreational vehicles. Pledged collateral could also include marketable securities and certificates of deposits. Premium Life Finance. Primis offers life insurance premium financing. The loan is utilized to pay the annual premiums due on the whole or universal life policy. The loan is fully secured by the cash value of the policy and personal liquid assets of the borrower or guarantor. Unsecured Personal Loans. Primis offers unsecured personal loans up to 50,000 and overdraft protection loans up to 10,000, based on specified underwriting criteria. We also offer these types of loans through an agreement with a third-party that sources and originates them for us based on our credit underwriting criteria. Panacea Consumer Loans. Panacea offers several unsecured consumer loan products to include student loan refinancing and pro re nata PRN loans. PRN loans may be utilized by graduating doctors to fund costs as they move into their chosen professions. Strict criteria has been established around these products.

 Because future loan losses are so closely intertwined with our underwriting policy, we have instituted what management believes is a stringent loan underwriting policy. Our underwriting guidelines are tailored for particular credit types, including lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term loans, equipment loans, real estate loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We have instituted a no exceptions policy for our consumer credit programs. Deposit Activities Overview We offer a broad range of deposit products, including checking, NOW, savings, and money market accounts and certificates of deposit, supporting the needs of businesses and individuals. We actively pursue business relationships by utilizing the business contacts of our senior management, other bank officers and our directors, thereby capitalizing on our knowledge of our local market areas. Commercial deposit products are enhanced by a robust suite of treasury and cash management services, including: Investment/sweep accounts Wire transfer services Employer services/payroll processing services Zero balance accounts Night depository services Depository transfers Merchant services (third party) ACH originations Business debit cards Controlled disbursement accounts Remote deposit capture Mobile and online banking Other products and services offered by the Bank include: Debit cards, ATM services, notary services, and wire transfer.

 Lines of Businesses Panacea Financial. In November 2020, the Company launched the Panacea Financial division, which focuses on providing unique financial products and services for the medical, dental and veterinary communities. Panacea offers personal loans, student debt refinance and practice loans as well as deposit products nationally. Panacea has partnerships with fourteen national and state associations. Additionally, its In-Training Medical/Dental School Loan Refinance product allows physicians and dentists that are in training the opportunity to refinance their student debt at a lower interest rate, while benefiting from affordable monthly payments during training. As of December 31, 2022, Panacea had approximately 248.4 million in outstanding loans. The division has successfully built a nationally-recognized brand and finished 2022 with a growing team of industry-leading commercial bankers experienced in providing financial services to its target communities across the United States. Life Premium Financing. The Company launched a division in the fourth quarter of 2021 focused on financing life insurance premiums for high net worth individuals across the United States. As of December 31, 2022, the Life Premium Finance Division had outstanding balances, net of deferred fees, of 193.8 million. Outstanding balances on these loans grow over three to five years. Consequently, the Company expects a sustainable growth rate in the division with each new loan originated. Primis Mortgage Company. On May 31, 2022, Primis Bank acquired Primis Mortgage Company (previously SeaTrust Mortgage Company), a regional residential mortgage company headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina. Primis Mortgage Company has since expanded to offer residential mortgages in the majority of the U.S. Residential mortgage loans originated through Primis Mortgage Company are primarily sold in the secondary market for fee income. As of December 31, 2022, Primis Mortgage originated 294.9 million loans. Digital Banking In 2022, Primis successfully launched its new digital bank platform. The platform includes an all-new mobile banking application that provides a quick and seamless account opening process all from within the app. Also in the fourth quarter of 2021, Primis launched its new V1BE service, the first bank delivery app for on-demand ordering of branch services. V1BE brings in-branch banking services right to the customer s doorstep, including cash delivery/withdrawals, cash pick-up/deposits, check deposits, change orders, cashier checks, and the instant issue of replacement debit cards. V1BE was initially piloted in the Richmond market but now covers the majority of our footprint, including the greater Washington, D.C. region. With V1BE, Primis is able to support any market and grow customer relationships without the need for a large branch presence. Funding and Revenue Sources The principal sources of funds for our lending and investment activities are deposits, repayment of loans, prepayments from mortgage-backed securities, repayments of maturing investment securities, Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances and other borrowed money. Principal sources of revenue are interest and fees on loans and investment securities as well as fee income derived from the maintenance of deposit accounts and income from bank-owned life insurance policies. Our principal expenses include interest paid on deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, junior subordinated debt, senior subordinated notes and other borrowings, and operating expenses. CREDIT ADMINISTRATION Because future loan losses are so closely intertwined with our underwriting policy, we have instituted what management believes are well-defined loan underwriting criteria and portfolio management practices. Our underwriting guidelines are tailored for particular credit types, including lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term 

 11 

Table of Contents 
 loans, equipment loans, real estate loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We will make extensions of credit based, among other factors, on the potential borrower s creditworthiness and likelihood of repayment. The Board of Directors has delegated assignment of individual credit authorities up to 10 million to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Credit Officer. For loans less than 2.5 million, we have named Credit Officers and two Specialty Executive Credit Officers, each with extensive industry specific experience with individual credit authority to 4 million. These individual lending authorities are based on the individual s technical ability and experience. All credits over 10 million are reviewed and approved by Executive Loan Committee, as defined in credit policy. For approval of third-party originated loans, we have delegated authority within an approved framework. All credit extensions in excess of 60 of the Bank s legal lending limit are also reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, our legal lending limit was approximately 62.2 million. Portfolio management is an integral part of sound credit practices. The responsible relationship manager in conjunction with credit administration will service loan credits through their life cycle. Primis has a dedicated Special Assets team that provides oversight on credit collection activities, to include legal negotiations, forbearance agreements, collateral sale, foreclosures and management of other real estate owned OREO ). This coordinated approach to credit provides a high quality portfolio. Credit Administration is responsible for monthly reporting to the Board of Directors on asset quality and performance. COMPETITION The banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability depends principally on our ability to compete in the market areas in which our banking operations are located. We experience substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in lending funds. The primary factors we encounter in competing for deposits are convenient office locations and rates offered. Direct competition for deposits comes from other commercial bank and thrift institutions, money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities which may offer more attractive rates than insured depository institutions are willing to pay. The primary factors we encounter in competing for loans include, among others, interest rate and loan origination fees and the range of services offered. Competition for origination of loans normally comes from other commercial banks, thrift institutions, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, insurance companies and fintech or digital lending companies. We have been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by: emphasizing customer service and technology; establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty; and providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of our customers. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL At Primis, we are committed to ensuring that our employees reach their personal, professional and financial peaks. We are attracting, developing, retaining and planning for the succession of key talent and executives to achieve our strategic objectives. Primis is continually investing in our workforce to further emphasize diversity and inclusion and to foster our employees' growth and career development. At December 31, 2022, we had 565 employees, nearly all of whom are full-time and of which approximately 66 were female and 21 were minorities. Employee Feedback. Fostering an inclusive environment requires that all employees are heard. Our Intranet houses the Employee Voice, which is a vehicle for employees to make suggestions, asks questions or voice opinions regarding the Company s practices. Recruitment. While the majority of our employees reside in Virginia, our recruitment efforts are both local and nationwide. We utilize a wide range of recruitment vehicles ranging from college recruitment sites such as Handshake , V3 program to recruit veterans to posting on popular job boards and conducting nationwide profile searches to find diverse and qualified candidates. Primis realizes that great people know other great people so we also offer a referral bonus to our employees.

 Benefits. Primis offers a comprehensive and competitive benefits package to meet a variety of individual needs. We offer three different medical plans, two of which allow for the employee to make contributions and receive an employer match on a Health Savings Account. In addition to dental insurance, supplemental insurance and a 401k, Primis offers employer paid short-term and long-term disability and life insurance. Our employees also enjoy a cash incentive for participating in our Wellness Program. Development. All new employees benefit from training to learn how to utilize key Company systems. New employees are also required to complete multiple learning modules that cover important compliance and regulatory requirements in the banking industry. Continuing education and advance training is offered to employees throughout their tenure at Primis. We encourage all employees to obtain job related training by covering the cost of the classes and/or learning materials and tests. Volunteerism . Primis is committed to the communities we serve and to supporting our employees in their volunteerism. Beginning in 2021, each employee receives eight paid hours to volunteer in their community or charity of choice each year. We maintain a commitment to the prosperity of each community the Company serves, donating to community, civic and philanthropic organizations in 2022. In addition to providing financial products built for the needs of our customers, the Company uses associate volunteerism and corporate philanthropy to build strong community partnerships. The employees volunteered for 125 hours in 2022. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under federal and state law. This discussion is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below, and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to Primis or the Bank. The business of Primis and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state law, including oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions VBFI ), a regulatory division of the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Changes in laws and regulations may alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or the Bank. It cannot be predicted whether and in what form new laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may be adopted or the extent to which the business of Primis and the Bank may be affected thereby, but they may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and earnings. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, federal and state banking regulators have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, our bank regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions. If we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock. If our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock.

 Supervision, regulation, and examination of Primis, the Bank, and our respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agencies, as described herein, are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the U.S. banking and financial system, rather than holders of our capital stock. Bank Holding Company Regulation Primis is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Bank Holding Company Act ). We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports and such other information as the Federal Reserve may request. Ongoing supervision is provided through regular examinations by the Federal Reserve and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management s ability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In addition to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company, Primis is subject to supervision and regulation by the VBFI under the banking and general business corporation laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Activity Limitations. Primis is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company. Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring or obtaining control of more than five percent (5 of the outstanding voting interests of any company that engages in activities other than those activities permissible for bank holding companies. Examples of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be permissible are making, acquiring, brokering, or servicing loans; leasing personal property; providing certain investment or financial advice; performing certain data processing services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other insurance products in certain locations; and performing certain insurance underwriting activities. The Bank Holding Company Act does not place geographic limits on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. Even with respect to permissible activities, however, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or its control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or control of such subsidiary would pose a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company. Source of Strength Obligations. A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank. The term source of financial strength means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the Federal Reserve) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress. If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements. Acquisitions. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or waiver of such prior approval before it (1) acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, such bank holding company will own or control more than five percent (5 of the voting shares of such bank, (2) acquires all of the assets of a bank, or (3) merges with any other bank holding company. In reviewing a proposed covered acquisition, among other factors, the Federal Reserve considers (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering. The Federal

 Reserve also reviews any indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with a proposed acquisition to ensure that the bank holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability to serve as a source of strength to its bank subsidiaries. Well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire control of banks in any state, subject to federal regulatory approval, without regard to whether such a transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. However, a bank holding company may not, following an interstate acquisition, control more than 10 of nationwide insured deposits or 30 of deposits within any state in which the acquiring bank operates. Change in Control. Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person (including an entity) may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to and obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as Primis. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10 or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company or a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock. Virginia Law. Certain state corporation laws may have an anti-takeover affect. Virginia law restricts transactions between a Virginia corporation and its affiliates and potential acquirers. The following discussion summarizes the two Virginia statutes that may discourage an attempt to acquire control of Primis. Virginia Code Sections 13.1-725 727.1 govern Affiliated Transactions. These provisions, with several exceptions discussed below, require approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting shares of material acquisition transactions between a Virginia corporation and any holder of more than 10 of its outstanding voting shares. Affiliated Transactions include mergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business, any dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of an interested shareholder, or any reclassification, including a reverse stock split, recapitalization, or merger of the corporation with its subsidiaries which increases the percentage of voting shares owned beneficially by any 10 shareholder by more than 5 . These provisions were designed to deter certain takeovers of Virginia corporations. In addition, the statute provides that, by affirmative vote of a majority of the voting shares other than shares owned by any 10 shareholder, a corporation can adopt an amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws providing that the Affiliated Transactions provisions shall not apply to the corporation. Primis opted out of the Affiliated Transactions provisions when it incorporated. Virginia law also provides that shares acquired in a transaction that would cause the acquiring person s voting strength to meet or exceed any of the three thresholds (20 , 33.33 or 50 have no voting rights for those shares exceeding that threshold, unless granted by a majority vote of shares not owned by the acquiring person. This provision empowers an acquiring person to require the Virginia Corporation to hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider the matter within 50 days of the request. Primis also opted out of this provision at the time of its incorporation. Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations. We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and NASDAQ. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protections, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) granted 

 15 

Table of Contents 
 shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhanced independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) required companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers. Incentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than 1.0 billion in assets, such as Primis and the Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The federal banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the federal banking agencies also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2022, these rules have not been implemented. We and Primis Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. On October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted final rules to implement Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act that require public companies to adopt and disclose a policy for the recovery of incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers that is based on erroneously reported financial information in the event of a required accounting restatement. The rules also require disclosure of the policy, including filing the policy as an exhibit to annual reports on Form 10-K and additional disclosure in the event an accounting restatement is required and recovery is triggered under the policy. The stock exchanges have up to 90 days after publication of the rules in the Federal Register to submit proposed listing standards to the SEC for approval, and the proposed listing standards must be effective no later than one year after the publication date. Following the effective date of the new listing standards, public companies will have 60 days to adopt the required clawback policy. Shareholder Say-On-Pay Votes. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders votes on proposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. Anti-tying rules. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing of services. Capital Requirements Primis and the Bank are each required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels. Primis and the Bank are each subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-based capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, plus retained earnings and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance 

 16 

Table of Contents 
 sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain high volatility commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4 . In addition, effective January 1, 2019, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of CET1 of 2.5 above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA ), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: well capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized , and critically undercapitalized . A depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios: 6.5 CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
 8.0 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;
 10.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and
 5.0 leverage ratio.
 The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve s Regulation Y, bank holding companies, such as Primis, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the Bank, Primis capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including Primis, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on Primis or the Bank s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. Both Primis and the Bank s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the capital conservation buffer as of December 31, 2022. Based on current estimates, we believe that Primis and the Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in 2023. On October 29, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule to simplify the regulatory capital requirements for eligible banks and holding companies with less than 10 billion in consolidated assets that opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR framework. A qualifying community banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion that exceeds the CBLR threshold would be exempt from the agencies current 

 17 

Table of Contents 
 capital framework, including the risk-based capital requirements and capital conservation buffer described above, and would be deemed well-capitalized under the agencies prompt corrective action regulations. Under the final rule, if a qualifying community banking organization elects to use the CBLR framework, it will be considered well-capitalized so long as its CBLR is greater than 9 . Primis does not use the CBLR framework. Payment of Dividends Primis is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and other subsidiaries. Its primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, no dividends may be paid by an insured bank if the bank is in arrears in the payment of any insurance assessment due to the FDIC. The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that the bank cease and desist from that practice. The Federal Reserve has formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider certain factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company s dividends if: its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Bank Regulation The operation of the Bank is subject to state and federal statutes applicable to state banks and the regulations of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ). The operations of the Bank may also be subject to applicable Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC regulation to the extent state banks are granted parity with national banks. Such statutes and regulations relate to, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, establishment of branches, consumer protection and other aspects of the Bank s operations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. Safety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal prudential bank regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.

 Examinations . The Bank is subject to regulation, reporting, and periodic examinations by the Federal Reserve and the VBFI. These regulatory authorities routinely examine the Bank s reserves, loan and investment quality, consumer compliance, management policies, procedures and practices and other aspects of operations. The Federal Reserve has adopted the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council s FFIEC rating system and assigns each financial institution a confidential composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of six essential components of an institution s financial condition and operations, including Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to Market Risk, as well as the quality of risk management practices. Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve having centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry. The CFPB has rule writing, examination, and enforcement authority with regard to the Bank s (and Primis compliance with a wide array of consumer financial protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (except Sections 615(e) and 628), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (sections 502 through 509 relating to privacy), among others. The CFPB has broad authority to enforce a prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Authority to supervise and examine Primis and the Bank for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations on a sampling basis and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions. Deposit Insurance Assessments. The Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank generally up to a maximum of 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions quarterly premiums to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity, and take into account certain risk-based financial ratios and other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. As of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30 , below the statutory minimum of 1.35 . The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 within eight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amended restoration plan to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio would be restored to at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. The FDIC s amended restoration plan increases the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC could further increase the deposit insurance assessments for certain insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if the DIF reserve ratio is not restored as projected. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company. Insider Transactions. The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations that restrict preferential loans and loan amounts to affiliates and insiders of banks, require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers and bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions. Reserves. The Bank is subject to Federal Reserve regulations that require the Bank to maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts). These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. Effective March 26, 2020, reserve requirement ratios were reduced to zero percent.

 Anti-Money Laundering . A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Primis Bank has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by law. FinCEN has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators are focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements. On January 1, 2021, Congress passed federal legislation that made sweeping changes to federal anti-money laundering laws, including changes that will be implemented in subsequent years. Economic Sanctions . The Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities. Concentrations in Lending. During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending (the Guidance and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by CRE lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for credit losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either: 
 Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100 or more of a bank s total risk based capital; or Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300 or more of a bank s total risk based capital. The Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type. Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA, which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve s assessment of the Bank s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. On September 21, 2020,

 the Federal Reserve issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that would modernize and substantially revise the regulations implementing the CRA. The Bank has a rating of Satisfactory in its most recent CRA evaluation. On May 5, 2022, the OCC, FRB, and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to provide for a coordinated approach to modernize their respective CRA regulations, such that all banks will be subject to the same set of CRA rules. No final rule has been issued, but the rulemaking may affect the Bank s CRA compliance obligations in the future. Consumer Regulation. Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that: limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank, including rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts; govern the Bank s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; require the Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; prohibit the Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit; govern the manner in which the Bank may collect consumer debts; and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services. Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to rules adopted by the CFPB, banks that make residential mortgage loans are required to make a good faith determination that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage loan prior to extending such credit, require that certain mortgage loans contain escrow payments, obtain new appraisals under certain circumstances, comply with integrated mortgage disclosure rules, and follow specific rules regarding the compensation of loan originators and the servicing of residential mortgage loans. Transactions with affiliates. There are various restrictions that limit the ability of the Bank to finance, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Primis or other affiliates. In addition, banks are subject to certain restrictions under Section 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act on certain transactions, including any extension of credit to its bank holding company or any of its other affiliates, on investments in the securities thereof, and on the taking of such securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Privacy and Cybersecurity . The Bank is subject to federal and state banking regulations that limit its ability to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require us to periodically disclose our privacy policies to consumers and allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party under certain circumstances. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Banking institutions are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of confidential and personal information are in effect across our lines of business. Furthermore, the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management. A financial institution is expected to implement multiple lines of defense against cyber-attacks and ensure that their risk management procedures address the risk posed by potential cyber threats. A financial institution is further expected to maintain procedures to effectively respond to a cyber-attack and resume operations following any such attack. Primis has adopted and implemented policies and procedures to comply with these privacy, information security, and cybersecurity requirements. On November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a new rule effective in 2022 that requires banks to notify their regulators within 36 hours of a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification incident. Non-Discrimination Policies. Primis Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice, and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists,

 how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA. LIBOR. On March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act to address references to LIBOR in contracts that (i) are governed by U.S. law; (ii) will not mature before June 30, 2023; and (iii) lack fallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practicable replacement for LIBOR. On December 16, 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule to implement the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. The final rule identifies replacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month LIBOR in contracts subject to the LIBOR Act. Audit Reports . Insured institutions with total assets of 500 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the institution s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement. Independent auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions. For insured institutions with total assets of 1.0 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements, internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the FDIC, and an attestation by the independent auditor regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted. For insured institutions with total assets of more than 3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. The FDICIA requires that institutions with total assets of 1.0 billion or more have independent audit committees, consisting of outside directors only. The committees of insured institutions with total assets of 3.0 billion or more must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel, and must not include representatives of large customers. The foregoing is only a brief summary of certain statutes, rules, and regulations that may affect Primis and the Bank. Numerous other statutes and regulations also will have an impact on the operations of Primis and the Bank. Supervision, regulation and examination of banks by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, not shareholders.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors (Restated) An investment in our common stock involves risks. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that Primis Financial Corp. believes affect its business and should be considered before making an investment in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us and our business. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A were to actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly and you could lose part or all of your investment. This Form 10-K/A also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Form 10-K/A entitled Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for additional information regarding forward-looking statements. Credit Risks (Restated) We are subject to risks related to our concentration of construction and land development and commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had 148.7 million of construction and land development loans, or 5.0 of our loan portfolio. Construction and land development loans are subject to risks during the construction phase that are not present in standard residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. These risks include: the viability of the contractor; the contractor s ability to successfully complete the project, to meet deadlines and time schedules and to stay within cost estimates, especially in the event of supply disruptions and labor shortages; and concentrations of such loans with a single contractor and its affiliates. 
 Real estate construction and land development loans may involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan and also present risks of default in the event of declines in property values or volatility in the real estate market during the construction phase. Our practice, in the majority of instances, is to secure the personal guaranty of individuals in support of our real estate construction and land development loans which provides us with an additional source of repayment. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any nonperforming construction and land development loans. If one or more of our larger borrowers were to default on their construction and land development loans, and we did not have alternative sources of repayment through personal guarantees or other sources, or if any of the aforementioned risks were to occur, we could incur significant losses. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1.19 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding, or 40.3 of our loan portfolio, including multi-family residential loans and loans secured by farmland. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loan to cover operating expenses and debt service. A significant amount of our loans are secured by real estate and any declines in real estate values in our primary markets could be detrimental to our financial condition and results of operations. Real estate lending (including commercial, construction, land development, and residential loans) is a large portion of our loan portfolio, constituting 2.01 billion, or approximately 68.2 of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2022. Although residential and commercial real estate values are currently strong in our market area, such values may not remain elevated. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, then we may not be able to realize the full value of the collateral that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 As of December 31, 2022, 40.3 of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans secured by commercial real estate, including multi-family residential loans and loans secured by farmland. As of December 31, 2022, 674.9 million, or approximately 22.9 of our total loans, were secured by single-family residential real estate. This includes 609.7 million in residential 1-4 family loans and 65.2 million in home equity lines of credit. If housing prices in our market areas do not remain strong or deteriorate, we may experience an increase in nonperforming loans, provision for credit losses and charge-offs. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. We have a meaningful amount of consumer loans that are unsecured and if the borrower defaults on the loan we have no recourse to collateral in which to recover any potential losses. Our consumer loan portfolio that are unsecured is 267.3 million, or approximately 9 of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2022. Included in this portfolio is 134.4 million of loans sourced based on our credit underwriting criteria and managed by a third party. Consumer loan repayment is primarily driven by the borrower s personal income which is impacted by various factors that are outside of the control of the borrower including macroeconomic conditions such as inflation and interest rates. Further, a downturn in the economy or other company-specific decisions that result in a borrower losing their job could cause the borrower s primary source of income for repayment of the loan to decline. Each of these factors may cause a borrower to evaluate their debts and as a result they may prioritize payment of other debts above the consumer loan due to us. Although macroeconomic conditions and the economy are currently stable, such conditions can change relatively quick and may not remain at current levels. If conditions change and macroeconomic conditions and the economy worsen borrowers may stop paying their loans and it could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A portion of our consumer loan portfolio is originated and serviced by a third-party and includes a credit enhancement from that third-party which may not be realizable and the inability to utilize it could be detrimental to our financial condition and results of operations. We receive a credit enhancement from the third-party managing 134.4 million of consumer loans that is recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. The credit enhancement is primarily provided through cash flows derived from loan originations. If lending slows or stops it would cause monthly cash receipts related to this credit enhancement to decline, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A significant amount of our third-party serviced consumer loans were originated with a zero interest promotional period exposing us to the credit risk of the third-party that is providing reimbursement to us for interest foregone in the event of borrower prepayment and failure of the third-party to perform under its reimbursement obligation could be detrimental to our financial condition and results of operations. Within the 134.4 million third-party originated and serviced consumer loan portfolio there is 44 of the portfolio that is in a promotional interest period as of December 31, 2022. The loans in these promotional interest periods legally accrue interest at the stated rate of the note agreement but the interest is not required to be paid during the promotional period. Further, if the borrower repays all of the principal on the note prior to the end of the promotional period the accrued interest is waived, but if there is any principal balance remaining at the end of the promotional period the borrower must repay all of the interest that has accrued. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of deferred interest on these loans was 2.6 million. Through an agreement with the third-party servicer, we are entitled to payment of all accrued interest that is waived on loans that repay all principal within the promotional period. There is a large concentration of these loans originated within proximity to each other resulting in 21 and 79 of the current balance of promotional loans ending their promotional period in 2023 and 2024, respectively. If a high percentage of these loans repay at the end of their promotional period a large amount of interest reimbursement will be due in a short period of time from the third-party servicer and if they cannot perform then we may not be able to realize any income on a significant amount of loans in our portfolio, which may adversely impact the realization of the fair value of the derivative asset recognized.

 If our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will suffer. At December 31, 2022, our nonperforming assets (which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days and accruing and OREO) totaled 38.8 million, or 1.32 of total loans and OREO, which is an increase of 22.4 million, or 135.8 , compared with nonperforming assets of 16.5 million, or 0.70 of total non-covered loans and OREO at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, our non-covered nonperforming assets (which consist of non-covered nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days and accruing and OREO) totaled 17.5 million, or 0.72 of total non-covered loans and OREO. Economic and market conditions are unstable, and although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and OREO remains manageable, we may incur losses if there is an increase in nonperforming assets in the future. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO, thereby adversely affecting our net interest income, and increasing loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related loan to the then fair value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. We must reserve for probable losses, which is established through a current period charge to the provision for credit losses as well as from time to time, as appropriate, a write down of the value of properties in our OREO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our OREO. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity. Finally, an increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our regulatory risk profile. There can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in nonperforming assets. If our allowance for credit losses is not adequate to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to ensure repayment. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we experience significant loan losses, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. A material addition to the allowance for credit losses could cause our earnings to decrease. Due to the relatively unseasoned nature of portions of our loan portfolio, we may experience an increase in delinquencies and losses as these loans continue to mature. In addition, federal regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any significant increase in our allowance for credit losses or charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies would result in a decrease in net income and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to credit quality risks and our credit policies may not be sufficient to avoid losses. We are subject to the risk of losses resulting from the failure of borrowers, guarantors and related parties to pay interest and principal amounts on their loans. Although we maintain credit policies and credit underwriting, monitoring and collection procedures, these policies and procedures may not prevent losses, particularly during periods in which the local, regional or national economy suffers a general decline. If borrowers fail to repay their loans, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Interest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely affect our revenue, expense, and the value of our financial instruments. 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 On July 27, 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, a joint announcement by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC was released and included a statement that the administrator of LIBOR has announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publications on June 30, 2023. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed SOFR as the preferred alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight U.S. treasury repurchase market. On December 16, 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. At this time, various iterations of the SOFR index are being used within the market, as are other indices such as the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield index and the American Financial Exchange's AMERIBOR index. It is unclear as to the degree to which the market will adopt such non-LIBOR indices or how the industry may transition various products to an accepted alternative to LIBOR. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could: adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expense associated with, and the value of floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR s role in determining market interest rates globally; prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language, or the absence of such language, in LIBOR-based instruments, including securities and loans; result in customer uncertainty and disputes around how variable rates should be calculated in light of the foregoing, thereby damaging our reputation and resulting in a loss of customers and additional costs to us; and require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on an applicable alternative pricing benchmark. The manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan, and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset liability management and business are uncertain. The Company s mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our profits. The Bank originates residential mortgage loans through Primis Mortgage Company which lends to borrowers nationwide. The success of our mortgage business is dependent upon its ability to originate loans and sell them to investors, in each case at or near current volumes. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Loan production levels may suffer if we experience a slowdown in housing markets, tightening credit conditions or increasing interest rates. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure, or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect the Company s results of operations. Deteriorating economic conditions may also cause home buyers to default on their mortgages. In certain cases, where the we have originated loans and sold them to investors, we may be required to repurchase loans or provide a financial settlement to investors if it is proven that the borrower failed to provide full and accurate information on, or related to, their loan application, if appraisals for such properties have not been acceptable or if the loan was not underwritten in

Table of Contents 
 accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor. In the ordinary course of business, we record an indemnification reserve relating to mortgage loans previously sold based on historical statistics and loss rates. If such reserves were insufficient to cover claims from investors, such repurchases or settlements would adversely affect our results of operations. Market Risks (Restated) Our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions in the areas where our operations and loans are concentrated, and our geographic concentration makes us vulnerable to local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other external events, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a mixed market environment with influences from both rural and urban areas. Our profitability depends on the general economic conditions in our market areas of Northern Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Charlottesville, Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula, Richmond, Hampton Roads and the surrounding areas. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to clients primarily in these market areas. As of December 31, 2022, a significant portion of our commercial real estate, real estate construction and residential real estate loans were made to borrowers in our market area. The local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on our commercial, real estate and construction and consumer loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. In addition, if the population or income growth in these market areas slows, stops or declines, income levels, deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in the curtailment of our expansion, growth and profitability. Political conditions could also impact our earnings. Our business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance. The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject us to significant risk from changes in interest rates. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Like most financial institutions, changes in interest rates can impact our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities, which is the difference between interest earned from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this gap will negatively impact our earnings. Based on our analysis of the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, an increase in the general level of interest rates may negatively affect the market value of the portfolio equity as well as negatively affect our net interest income since a majority of our assets are fixed rate loans. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans as well as increase our funding costs. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, but also allow us to reduce funding costs. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, funding, and our overall results. While it is expected that the FRB will continue to increase the target federal funds rate in 2023 to combat recent inflationary trends, we are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which are affected by factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other changes in financial markets. Although our asset liability management strategy is designed to keep our risk within acceptable parameters, it may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Unstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and operations. We are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 confidence declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, and uncertainty about economic stability and a potential recession. The U.S. government's decisions regarding its debt ceiling and the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations may cause further interest rate increases, disrupt access to capital markets, and deepen recessionary conditions. While our management team continually monitors market conditions and economic factors, throughout our footprint, we are unable to predict the duration or severity of such conditions or factors. If conditions were to worsen nationally, regionally, or locally, then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, the demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. An increase in our non-performing assets and related increases in our provision for loan losses, coupled with a potential decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services, could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth. Our clients may also be adversely impacted by changes in regulatory, trade (including tariffs), and tax policies and laws, all of which could reduce demand for loans and adversely impact our borrowers' ability to repay our loans. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn or recession, volatile business environment, hostile third-party action, or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. The effects of any economic downturn or recession could continue for many years after the downturn or recession is considered to have ended. Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investment securities, financial performance and capital. We maintain an investment securities portfolio that includes, but is not limited to, collateralized mortgage obligations, agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The market value of investment securities may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the bonds themselves, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities. At each reporting period, we evaluate investment securities and other assets for impairment indicators. We may be required to record additional impairment charges if our investment securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred no other-than-temporary impairment charges related to credit losses or sales of securities. If in future periods we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the write-offs occur. A portion of our income on a portfolio of consumer loans with promotional features is due from a third-party that originated the loans on our behalf. The value of this estimated reimbursement is recorded in our balance sheet at fair value as a derivative and actual results and a significant decline in the third-party s credit risk may impact the value of the derivative and our ability to realize that value which could affect our financial performance and results of operations. We record a derivative liability as of December 31, 2022, which mostly reflects our estimate of the fair value of the performance fees due from us to the third-party loan servicer that manages an unsecured consumer loan portfolio with promotional features, net of interest reimbursements due from them to us. This derivative liability reflects the performance fees we owe the third-party for performing loans they have originated for us, net of interest anticipated to be waived to borrowers under the assumed pre-payment of the borrowers loans that the third party will be required to pay to us. The derivative is required to be valued at fair value under U.S. GAAP with the use of various assumptions including borrower pre-payment, expected credit losses, and third-party servicer credit risk. Assumptions used to determine the value of the derivative are sensitive to various factors not within our control that include borrower repayment risk and the credit risk of the third-party servicer. These assumptions are determined based on the information available to the Company as of each balance sheet date. Actual results that differ significantly from our prior assumptions may result in an increase of the liability or a decrease that causes the liability becoming an asset. Further, the derivative could become an asset in future periods but changes in assumptions or actual behavior of the borrowers and/or the third-party could results in an inability to realize the value of the derivative asset. Additionally, updates to future fair value calculations of the derivative for changes in assumptions or inputs could result in a significant increase or decrease in the derivative value that is recorded

 in our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Our stock price can be volatile. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things: actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations; recommendations by securities analysts; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry; perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors; new technology used, or services offered, by competitors; significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; changes in valuations of Goodwill and other Intangible Assets; changes in government regulations; and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts or pandemics. 
 General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. The trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. Although our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the trading volume is low, and you are not assured liquidity with respect to transactions in our common stock. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall. Inflation could negatively impact our business, our profitability and our stock price. Prolonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and negatively impacting the demand for our products and services. Additionally, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and client s purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, decreases in loan collateral values and increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer. ESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, client, and third party relationships and may negatively affect our stock price. Our business faces increasing public scrutiny related to ESG activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as DEI, environmental stewardship, including with respect to climate change, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate governance, and transparency, or fail to consider ESG factors in our business operations. Furthermore, as a result of our diverse base of clients and business partners, we may face potential negative publicity based on the identity of our clients or business partners and the public s (or certain segments of the public s) view of those 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 entities. Such publicity may arise from traditional media sources or from social media and may increase rapidly in size and scope. If our client or business partner relationships were to become intertwined in such negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain clients, business partners, and employees may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may also be negatively impacted. Additionally, we may face pressure to not do business in certain industries that are viewed as harmful to the environment or are otherwise negatively perceived, which could impact our growth. Additionally, investors and shareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. We may incur meaningful costs with respect to our ESG efforts and if such efforts are negatively perceived, our reputation and stock price may suffer. Operational Risks Our business strategy includes strategic growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies such as the continuing need for infrastructure and personnel, the time and costs inherent in integrating a series of different operations and the ongoing expense of acquiring and staffing new banks or branches. We may not be able to expand our presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets and any expansion could adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to manage our growth. Although there can be no assurance of success or the availability of branch or financial services acquisitions in the future, we may seek to supplement our internal growth through attractive acquisitions. We cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions, or whether any such acquisition will occur at all. Our acquisition efforts have traditionally focused on targeted entities in markets in which we currently operate and markets in which we believe we can compete effectively. However, as consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and, as the number of appropriate targets decreases, the prices for potential acquisitions could increase which could reduce our potential returns, and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. We may compete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay. We must respond to rapid technological changes and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated. If competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly and in order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate. New lines of business, products or services and technological advancements may subject us to additional risks. From time to time, we implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the 

 30 

Table of Contents 
 markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, our implementation of certain new technologies, such as those related to artificial intelligence, automation and algorithms, in our business processes may have unintended consequences due to their limitations or our failure to use them effectively. In addition, cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems, and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any new line of business, new product or service and/or new technology could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business, new products or services and/or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions or to realize the anticipated benefits of them. A successful integration of each acquired business with ours will depend substantially on our ability to successfully consolidate operations, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. While we have substantial experience in successfully integrating institutions we have acquired, we may encounter difficulties during integration, such as: the loss of key employees; the disruption of operations and businesses; loan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss; possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies; unexpected issues with expected branch closures; and/or unexpected issues with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit; ,all of which could divert resources from regular banking operations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful merger integrations. Further, we acquire businesses with the expectation that these mergers will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross selling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these mergers is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate these institutions in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be adversely affected. When the Company completes an acquisition, goodwill and other intangible assets are often recorded on the date of acquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires goodwill to be tested for impairment, and we perform such 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 impairment analysis at least annually. A significant adverse change in expected future cash flows or sustained adverse change in the value of our common stock could require the asset to become impaired. If impaired, we would incur a charge to earnings that would have a significant impact on the results of operations. Our carrying value of goodwill and net amortizable intangibles were approximately 104.6 million and 3.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. We rely on third-party vendors to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Third-party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. We have selected these third-party vendors carefully and have conducted the due diligence consistent with regulatory guidance and best practices. While we have ongoing programs to review third-party vendors and assess risk, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor s ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. We face significant cyber and data security risk that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation and expose us to significant liabilities. As a financial institution, we are under threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-attacks. This risk has increased in recent years, and continues to increase, as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, are less frequent but would present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, we have been subject to hacking and cyber-attack and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer additional losses in the future. Due to changing behaviors since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed a portion of our employees to work remotely from their homes on a full-time or hybrid schedule. Technology in employees homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers. The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in material adverse consequences to us including damage to our reputation and the loss of customers. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to significant liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement of customers adversely affected by security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of other future events, successful attacks or systems failures at the Bank or at other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions including the Bank. 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our information security procedures and contracts and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that occurs. In recent years, we have incurred significant expense towards improving the reliability of our systems and their security from attack. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that we may be materially harmed by cyber-attacks and information security breaches in the future. Methods used to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication), often are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to address these methods in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventive measures. If such an attack or breach does occur, we might not be able to fix it timely or adequately. To the extent that such an attack or breach relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit the risk. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could impair our relationship with our customers and adversely affect our business. Many community banks attract customers based on the personal relationships that the banks officers and customers establish with each other and the confidence that the customers have in the officers. We significantly depend on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. We also believe our management team s depth and breadth of experience in the banking industry is integral to executing our business plan. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or other key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations. While the level of disruption caused by, and the economic impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic lessened in 2022, there is no assurance that the pandemic will not worsen again, included as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus, or another health related emergency will not emerge. Any worsening of the pandemic, a new health related emergency, and their effects on the economy could further impact our business, our provision and allowance for credit losses, and the value of certain assets that we carry on our balance sheet such as goodwill. Our clients, business partners, and third-party providers, including those who perform critical services for our business, may also be adversely affected. Liquidity Risks Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity is essential to our business. Our ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our ability to obtain funding for loan originations, working capital, possible acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. We anticipate that our retail and commercial deposits will be sufficient to meet our funding needs in the foreseeable future. We may rely on deposits obtained through intermediaries, FHLB advances, and other wholesale funding sources to obtain the funds necessary to implement our growth strategy. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general, including a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Access to liquidity may also be negatively impacted by the value of our securities portfolio, if liquidity and/or business strategy necessitate the sales of securities in a loss position. To the extent we are not successful in obtaining 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 such funding, we will be unable to implement our strategy as planned which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and its financial condition and results of operations. Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Although a statement by the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC stated that all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money after only one business day of closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments with SVB, Signature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. If any parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access deposits with another financial institution, funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties credit quality, ability to pay their obligations to us, or to enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. In this regard, counterparties to SVB credit agreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may experience direct impacts from the closure of SVB and uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Additionally, confidence in the safety and soundness of regional banks specifically or the banking system generally could impact where customers choose to maintain deposits, which could materially adversely impact our liquidity, loan funding capacity, ability to raise funds, and results of operations. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the 2008-2010 financial crisis. Inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to 25 billion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediate liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion. Although we assess our funding relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, our customers, the financial institutions with which we have arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform our obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which we or our customers have financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. Additionally, we could be impacted by current or future negative perceptions and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry (including the impact of Moody s Investors Service s rating change of the outlook of the US banking system from stable to negative ), which could worsen over time and result in downward pressure on, and continued or accelerated volatility of, bank securities.

 Capital Adequacy Risks Future growth or operating results may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available, be available on unfavorable terms or may be dilutive. Primis Bank is required by the FRB to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In the event that our future operating results erode capital, if the Bank is required to maintain capital in excess of well-capitalized standards, or if we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital on favorable terms when needed, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These outcomes could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations through acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in order to raise additional capital, we may need to issue shares of our common stock that would dilute the book value of our common stock and reduce our current shareholders percentage ownership interest to the extent they do not participate in future offerings. We may issue a new series of preferred stock or debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We have issued 27.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due January 31, 2027 and 60.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. In the future, we may increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, which may include senior or additional subordinated notes, classes of preferred shares and/or common shares. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Preferred shares and debt, if issued, have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend or interest payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our common stock. Future issuances and sales of parity preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may also cause prevailing market price for our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us. Further issuances of our common stock could be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock; however, our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions. We declared the first cash dividend on our common stock in February 2012, and each quarter thereafter through 2022. There are a number of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Our principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock is cash dividends that we receive from the Bank. The payment of dividends by the Bank to us is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal banking laws, regulations and authorities. The federal banking statutes prohibit federally insured banks from making any capital distributions (including a dividend payment) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be "under capitalized" as defined by statute. In addition, the relevant federal regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit an insured bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, as determined by the agency, in conducting an activity. The payment of dividends could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice, depending on the financial condition of the Bank. Regulatory authorities could impose administratively stricter limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us if such limits were deemed appropriate to preserve certain capital adequacy requirements.

Table of Contents 
 Regulatory Risks (Restated) We are heavily regulated by federal and state agencies; changes in laws and regulations or failures to comply with such laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our financial results. We and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and the Bank, and our respective operations. Additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, bank regulatory authorities have the authority to bring enforcement actions against banks and their holding companies for unsafe or unsound practices in the conduct of their businesses or for violations of any law, rule or regulation, any condition imposed in writing by the appropriate bank regulatory agency or any written agreement with the agency. Possible enforcement actions against us could include the issuance of a cease-and-desist order that could be judicially enforced, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital or enter into a strategic transaction, whether by merger or otherwise, with a third party, the appointment of a conservator or receiver, the termination of insurance on deposits, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties, and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us. As a regulated entity, Primis and the Bank must maintain certain required levels of regulatory capital that may limit our operations and potential growth. As further described above under Supervision and Regulation Capital Requirements, Primis and the Bank each are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FRB. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s and our consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet commitments as calculated under these regulations. As of December 31, 2022, Primis and the Bank exceeded the amounts required to be well capitalized with respect to all four required capital ratios. As of December 31, 2021, Primis leverage, CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and Total risk-based capital ratios were 9.52 , 10.07 , 10.40 , and 14.33 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank s leverage, CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and Total risk-based capital ratios were 11.24 , 12.40 , 12.40 and 13.59 , respectively. Many factors affect the calculation of Primis and the Bank s risk-based assets and its ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable capital ratios. For example, changes in risk weightings of assets relative to capital and other factors may combine to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets in the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the Total risk-based capital ratio. Any increases in its risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase in its capital to maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized loan losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan impairments, impairment losses on investment securities and other factors will decrease the Bank s capital, thereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios. Primis and the Bank s failure to remain well capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under FRB rules, if the Bank ceases to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that it pays on deposits and its ability to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits may be restricted. As of December 31, 2022, we had 100.0 million of brokered certificates of deposits.

 Financial Reporting Risks (Restated) Failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could impact the price of our common stock. Failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could result in us not being able to accurately report our financial results, prevent or detect fraud, or provide timely and reliable financial information pursuant to our reporting obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, it could cause our investors to lose confidence in the financial information we report, which could affect the trading price of our common stock. Management regularly reviews and updates our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Management re-evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting for the year end December 31, 2022, related to properly assessing the accounting treatment for an agreement with a third-party to originate and manage a portfolio of consumer loans. Management is currently remediating the material weakness including design of and testing new controls related to the accounting related to the weakness. If management fails to timely and effectively remediate the deficiency in its control environment for this accounting issue it could result in additional incorrect accounting application to similar transactions in the future which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Primis Financial Corp. does not have any unresolved staff comments from the SEC to report for the year ended December 31, 2022. Item 2. Properties Primis Financial Corp. s principal office is located at 6830 Old Dominion Drive, McLean, Virginia. The Company has administrative offices in Warrenton and Glen Allen, Virginia. Including these main locations, our bank owns 32 properties and leases 17 properties, all of which are used as branch locations or for housing operational units in Maryland and Virginia. At December 31, 2022, Primis Bank had thirty-two full-service branches in Virginia and Maryland and also provided services to customers through certain online and mobile applications. Thirty full-service retail branches are in Virginia (Ashland, Burgess, Callao, Central Garage, Charlottesville, Chester, Colonial Heights, Courtland, Gloucester, Gloucester Point, Hampton, Hartfield, Heathsville, Kilmarnock, Leesburg, McLean, Mechanicsville (2), Middleburg, Midlothian, Newport News, Quinton, Richmond, Surry, Tappahannock (2), Urbanna, Warrenton, Waverly, and Williamsburg) and two full-service retail branches are in Maryland (Rockville, and Upper Marlboro). Primis believes its facilities are in good operating condition, are suitable and adequate for its operational needs and are adequately insured. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Primis and Primis Bank are from time to time a party, as both plaintiff and defendant, to various claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Bank s business, including administrative and/or legal proceedings that may include employment-related claims, as well as claims of lender liability, breach of contract, and other similar lending-related claims. While the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time, the Bank s management presently believes that such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Bank s financial

 condition or results of operations. There are no proceedings pending, or to management s knowledge, threatened, that represent a significant risk against Primis or Primis Bank as of December 31, 2022. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Common Stock Market Prices Primis common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol FRST . There were 24,685,458 shares of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on March 6, 2023, which were held by 1,212 shareholders of record. As of that date, the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was 11.56. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans As of December 31, 2022, Primis had outstanding stock options granted under the 2010 Stock Awards and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan and the 2017 Equity Compensation Plan (the 2017 Plan ), which were approved by its shareholders. The following table provides information as of December 31, 2022 regarding Primis equity compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance:

Dividends We declared the first cash dividend on our common stock in February 2012, and each quarter thereafter through 2022. There are a number of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to Primis or by Primis to shareholders. The Company s ability to pay dividends to stockholders is largely dependent upon the dividends it receives from the Bank, and the Bank is subject to regulatory limitations on the amount of cash dividends it may pay. Performance Graph The following chart compares the cumulative total shareholder return on Primis common stock during the five years ended December 31, 2022, with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index for the same period.

 Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Restated) Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A generally discusses year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Discussions of comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form10-K/A but can be found in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management s discussion and analysis is presented to aid the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of Primis. This discussion and analysis should be read with the consolidated financial statements, the footnotes thereto, and the other financial data included in this report. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Restated) We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. Allowance for credit losses Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326. The allowance is reported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of other expenses. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is

 dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of goodwill was 104.6 million and 101.9 million, respectively. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on Step one of the previous accounting guidance s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350. Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step two which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The standard does not change the guidance on completing Step one of the goodwill impairment test. An entity will still be able to perform today s optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before proceeding to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds it fair value. For our assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2022, our annual test date, we performed a step one quantitative assessment to determine if the fair value of all our Bank reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. We concluded that the fair value of all our Bank reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts and no impairment was present based on management s assessment. No impairment was indicated in 2022, 2021 or 2020. We determined that for Primis Mortgage, we did not need a quantitative assessment and performed a qualitative assessment. No impairment was indicated for 2022 for the Primis Mortgage segment. We will continue to monitor the impact of current economic conditions and other events on the Company s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the current economic conditions and other events were to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill. Third-party originated and serviced consumer loan portfolio In the second half of 2021, we partnered with a third-party (the Third Party Originator/Servicer or TPOS to originate and service unsecured consumer loans through their proprietary point-of-sale technology (the Consumer Program ). Loan options under the Consumer Program include traditional fully-amortizing loans and promotional loans with no interest, or same-as-cash , features if the loan is fully repaid in the promotional window. The loans are originated at par in the Bank s name and have a term of 5 to 12 years with a much shorter effective life due to amortization and pay downs. The Consumer Program is governed by multiple interrelated agreements including the loan agreement between the Bank and the customer and agreements with the TPOS. The structure of the Consumer Program is intended to generate loans that yield a targeted return to the Bank on a portfolio basis while also providing limited credit enhancement from the TPOS. Key characteristics of the combined arrangement include: The TPOS contributes funds to a reserve account at the time of origination to be used for future charge-offs if necessary. 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 When a promotional loan pays off prior to the end of the promotional period, the customer owes no interest on the loan and any interest accrued during the period is waived. In that event, the TPOS reimburses the Bank for the interest the customer otherwise would have paid if the promotional period didn t exist. Excess yield on the portfolio after realized charge-offs and above an agreed upon target rate due to the Bank is paid to the TPOS as a performance fee. In the event charge-offs exceed the amount available as a performance fee, the TPOS remits a portion of current period originations to reimburse for losses and, if necessary, releases funds from the reserve account. If charge-offs exceed the amounts above, they roll over to future periods to offset potential performance fees and subsequent reserve account fundings related to the portfolio. 
 Under U.S. GAAP, agreements with multiple counterparties, such as the customer and TPOS, are generally required to be accounted for separately even if the agreements are highly interrelated. As a result, we account for the Consumer Program under multiple units of account with the following impacts: The loans are accounted for as one unit of account under U.S. GAAP including revenue recognition and inclusion in our CECL allowance methodology. o No interest income is recognized on promotional loans until the expiration of the promotional period. If the customer doesn t pay off the loan prior to that expiration, deferred interest from the beginning of the loan becomes the obligation of the customer and is billed straight-line over the remaining life of the loan. We recognize the accumulated deferred interest at the time of expiration discounted for the time value of money with the discount amortized over the remaining life of the loan. 
 The agreement that governs the performance fee and interest reimbursement from the TPOS is a separate unit of account and meets the definition of a derivative under U.S. GAAP and is accounted for at fair value in our financial statements. The primary drivers of the derivative value include estimated prepayment activity on promotional loans that would trigger reimbursement from the TPOS to us and estimated excess yield above projected credit losses that would lead to performance fee payments from us to the TPOS. The credit risk of the third-party and discount rates used in the calculation also impact the value of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as gains or losses in noninterest income. Additional details on the inputs to the derivative value can be found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Derivatives in this Form 10-K/A. Noninterest income each period includes actual amounts received during the period for interest reimbursement and amounts paid by the TPOS under the limited credit enhancement described above. Noninterest expense each period includes actual amounts paid during the period for performance fees and servicing fees as defined in our agreement with the TPOS. 
 We have 134.4 million of loans outstanding in the Consumer Program, or 5 of our total gross loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 44 of the loans were in a promotional period requiring no payment of interest on their loans with 21 and 79 of these promotional loan periods ending in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Cost of deposits increased to 0.49 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.48 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Return on average assets from continuing operations totaled 0.43 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.93 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest margin increased to 3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.01 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Provision for credit losses were 11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to recovery of credit losses of 5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Allowance for credit losses to total loans (excluding PPP balances) were 1.17 at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.29 at December 31, 2021. Book value per share of 15.76 at December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 0.93 from December 31, 2021 after 0.40 in dividends paid over the last twelve months. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Restated) Net Income Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 14.1 million, or 0.58 per basic and 0.57 per diluted share, compared to 30.9 million, or 1.26 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 54.2 decrease in the net income during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by higher noninterest expenses from an increase in employee

 compensation and benefits expense in the current year. The decrease in net income was also attributable to provision for credit losses in 2022 compared to a recovery of credit losses in 2021 primarily as a result of robust loan growth. Net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was zero, or zero basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to net income from discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 0.23 million, or 0.01 basic and diluted earnings per share. The net income from discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to the closing of the STM transaction in 2021, as discussed in Note 1 - Organization and significant accounting policies. Net Interest Income Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income was 101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Primis net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.30 , compared to 3.01 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest margin was impacted heavily by the origination of PPP loans in 2021. Net PPP fee income recognized was 0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 versus 11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total income on interest-earning assets was 123.3 million and 113.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.00 and 3.62 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by market conditions. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 4 basis points to 0.64 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.60 cost on average interest-bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest and fees on loans totaled 115.1 million and 106.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The accretion of the discount on loans acquired in the acquisitions contributed 0.9 million to net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in accretion was due to slowdown in the volume of acquired loan prepayments and payoffs. Average loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 were 2.6 billion compared to 2.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company s loan growth over the past year and the improved asset mix has been the driver of positive movements in both margins and net interest income.

Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by considering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management s judgment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 11.3 million, compared to a recovery for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 5.8 million, primarily as a result of robust loan growth. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 19.5 million. We had charge-offs totaling 8.1 million during 2022, 2.5 million during 2021 and 2.3 million during 2020. There were recoveries totaling 2.2 million during 2022, 1.1 million during 2021 and 0.69 million during 2020. The Financial Condition Section of Management s Discussion and Analysis provides information on our loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for credit losses.

 Noninterest Income The following tables present the major categories of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 

For the Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 5,745 7,309 (1,564) Income from bank-owned life insurance 1,994 1,687 307 Mortgage banking income 5,054 5,054 Gain on debt extinguishment 573 (573) Gain on sale of other investment 4,144 4,144 Consumer Program derivative 65 3 62 Other noninterest income 1,350 1,566 (216) Total noninterest income 18,352 11,138 7,214 Noninterest income increased 64.8 to 18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by a 5.1 million increase in mortgage banking income in the current year associated with the Primis Mortgage acquisition in the second quarter of 2022 and a 4.1 million gain on the sale of an other investment. These increases were offset by a decrease of 1.6 million from the previous year period in income on account maintenance and deposit service fees primarily due to a reduction in income from new debit card contracts driven by lower fees and 0.6 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2021. Noninterest Expense The following tables present the major categories of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 

For the Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Salaries and benefits 49,005 36,741 12,264 Occupancy expenses 5,628 5,956 (328) Furniture and equipment expenses 5,231 3,622 1,609 Amortization of core deposit intangible 1,325 1,364 (39) Virginia franchise tax expense 3,254 2,899 355 Data processing expense 6,013 3,850 2,163 Marketing expense 3,067 1,726 1,341 Telephone and communication expense 1,433 1,790 (357) Net (gain) loss on other real estate owned 72 87 (15) Net loss on bank premises and equipment 684 684 Professional fees 4,787 5,467 (680) Miscellaneous lending expenses 1,710 1,068 642 Other operating expenses 9,239 6,906 2,333 Total noninterest expenses 91,448 71,476 19,972 Noninterest expenses were 91.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 71.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The 27.9 increase in noninterest expenses was primarily attributable to a 12.3 million increase in employee compensation driven by increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage and Panacea and higher benefits expense mainly related to branch closures and consolidations in 2022. The increase in noninterest expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 was also driven by a 2.2 million increase in data processing expense in 2022 driven by higher technology expenses in the current year. Other notable drivers of the increase in the current year include

 1.3 million of higher marketing and advertising costs tied to the digital bank launch and V1BE adoption campaigns and an increase of 1.3 million in occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021. Professional fees decreased 0.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 due to increased consulting fees and legal expenses in 2021 largely related to the STM transaction and from increased recruiter fees for management and Life Premium hires. FINANCIAL CONDITION (Restated) Balance Sheet Overview Total assets were 3.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 3.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. Total cash and cash equivalents were 77.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and 530.2 million as of December 31, 2021. Investment securities decreased from 294.3 million as of December 31, 2021 to 249.8 million as of December 31, 2022.

 The following table describes the period over which our Consumer Program loans that are currently in a no interest promotional period will exit that promotional period and begin to amortize. All of these promotional loans amortize over four years from the date they exit the promotional period if not prepaid before the end of the promotional period (in thousands): 

Amount ending No Interest Promo Period in next 12 months Amount ending No Interest Promo Period in next 13-24 months Total No Interest promo as of 12/31/22 Consumer Program Loans 12,365 46,317 58,682 Asset Quality; Past Due Loans and Nonperforming Assets Asset quality remained good during 2022, despite an increase in classified balances, which was largely due to a downgrade of one secured relationship, recognizing anticipated loss in the fourth quarter of 2022. While the impact of COVID-19 subsided, the residual effect of COVID-19 and its variants, as well as new risks emerging from geopolitical conflict, inflation and the threat of recession continue to cause economic instability and uncertainty in evaluating the impact on our asset quality. We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections. We maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure occurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio management practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the value of the real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy in our market area, rising interest rates, historically high inflation, global supply chain issues and potential recession. Calculated reserves (prior to qualitative adjustments) increased at the end of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a growth in unguaranteed loan balances, coupled with worsened economic forecasts, specifically in the House Price Index and Gross State Product factors. At December 31, 2022, the qualitative reserve decreased 2.5 million from the qualitative reserve applied at December 31, 2021. This decrease in qualitative reserves 

 50 

Table of Contents 
 observed in 2022 is attributed to adjustments to the qualitative reserve framework s thresholds and key risk indicators as part of the annual model refresh. The following table presents a comparison of nonperforming assets as of December 31, for the years indicated (in thousands): 

December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Nonaccrual loans 35,484 15,029 Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest 3,361 283 Total nonperforming loans 38,845 15,312 Other real estate owned 1,163 Total nonperforming assets 38,845 16,475 Troubled debt restructurings 3,599 3,401 SBA guaranteed amounts included in nonperforming loans 3,969 1,388 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 1.17 1.24 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 97.35 193.66 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 88.93 190.09 Nonaccrual to total loans 1.20 0.64 Nonperforming assets excluding SBA guaranteed loans to total assets 0.98 0.44 OREO at December 31, 2022 was zero, compared to 1.2 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by sale of properties and write-downs on OREO during 2022. Nonaccrual loans were 35.5 million (excluding 0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at December 31, 2022, compared to 15.0 million (excluding 1.1 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at December 31, 2021, an increase of 136.1 . These increases were driven largely by one relationship that was criticized in the second quarter of 2022 and was subsequently downgraded further in the third quarter of 2022 and placed on nonaccrual. The primary businesses in the relationship are multiple assisted living facilities. Management has a receiver appointed by the court ahead of an anticipated foreclosure and aggressively valued the properties for that sale. Provisions associated with this single borrower in the fourth quarter of 2022 were approximately 5.0 million. The ratio of nonperforming assets (excluding the SBA guaranteed loans) to total assets was 0.98 and 0.44 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We originate a portion of our consumer loans (the Consumer Program) using a third party that sources and subsequently manages the portfolio of loans. As of December 31, 2022, the principal balance outstanding was 134.4 million. These loans are accounted for similar to our other consumer loans and are not placed on nonaccrual because they are charged off when they become 90 days past due. At December 31, 2022, our total substandard loans was 41.0 million. Included in the total substandard loans were SBA guarantees of 0.8 million. Special mention loans totaled 32.3 million at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were eighteen TDR loans in the amount of 3.6 million. There have been no defaults of TDRs modified during the past twelve months. We identify potential problem loans based on loan portfolio credit quality. We define our potential problem loans as our substandard loans less total nonperforming loans noted above. At December 31, 2022, our potential problem loans totaled 2.2 million. Allowance for Credit Losses We are very focused on the asset quality of our loan portfolio, both before and after a loan is made. We have established underwriting standards that we believe are effective in maintaining high credit quality in our loan portfolio. We have experienced loan officers who take personal responsibility for the loans they originate, a skilled underwriting team and 

 51 

Table of Contents 
 highly qualified credit officers that review each loan application carefully. We have designed a credit matrix, which requires dual authority to approve any credit over 2.5 million. We have two specialty Executive Credit Officers with extensive industry experience in medical practice and life premium credit financing with authority up to 4.0 million and joint authority with the Chief Credit Officer up to 10.0 million. All credit exposures over 10.0 million are reviewed and approved by Executive Loan Committee consisting of all named Credit Officers with concurrence from the Chief Executive Officer on any credit in excess of 25.0 million. Loans in excess of 60 of the Bank s legal lending limit are approved by the full Board of Directors or two outside directors. Our allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Management evaluates the allowance at least quarterly. In addition, on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews our loan portfolio, evaluates credit quality, reviews the loan loss provision and the allowance for credit losses and makes changes as may be required. In evaluating the allowance, management and the board of directors consider the growth, composition and industry diversification of the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels and all other known factors affecting loan collectability. The allowance for credit losses is based on the CECL methodology and represents management s estimate of an amount appropriate to provide for expected credit losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. This estimate is based on historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts applied to various loan types that compose our portfolio, including the effects of known factors such as the economic environment within our market area will have on net losses. The allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination by the regulatory agencies as to the appropriate level of the allowance. Loan Review Our loan review program is administrated by the Chief Risk Officer and the Loan Review Manager who reports the results directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In 2022, the Loan Review Program performed reviews on loan balances totaling 894.8 million or 56.0 of the commercial loan portfolio outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Internal loan review performed reviews on loans totaling 17.9 , and an independent third party consultant performed reviews on 38.1 of this portfolio and 94.9 million in unfunded commitments. Primis Bank s 2023 Loan Review Program was approved by the Audit Committee on January 26, 2023. The Program s annual goal is to have an overall review penetration rate of at least 50 of the Commercial Loan Portfolio outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The Program incorporates a robust risk-based approach review of the Bank s Loan Portfolio that will include process, targeted portfolio and full-scope loan reviews. The Program s review goal remains well within regulatory standards and industry best practices. In accordance with Credit Policy, the Bank s Loan Review Program will utilize and incorporate both internal and 3rd party external resources in a complementary fashion to achieve the objectives of the Program.

 Our assessment involves uncertainty and judgment; therefore, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory authorities, as part of their periodic examination, may require additional charges to the provision for credit losses in future periods if the results of their reviews warrant additions to the allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs were 5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up from 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Increase in net charge-offs were primarily related to an impaired relationship in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 1.5 million of net charge-offs related to the Consumer Program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s allowance for credit losses included 1.4 million related to the Consumer Program. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio provides us with required liquidity and investment securities to pledge as collateral to secure public deposits, certain other deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, and repurchase agreements. Our investment securities portfolio is managed by our Treasurer, who has significant experience in this area, with the concurrence of our Asset/Liability Committee. In addition to our Treasurer (who is the chairman of the Asset/Liability Committee) and our Controller, this committee is comprised of outside directors and other senior officers of the Bank, including but not limited to our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Investment management is performed in accordance with our investment policy, which is approved annually by the Board of Directors. Our investment policy authorizes us to invest in: Government National Mortgage Association GNMA ), Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC residential mortgage-backed securities MBS and commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS Collateralized mortgage obligations U.S. Treasury securities SBA guaranteed loan pools Agency securities Obligations of states and political subdivisions Corporate debt securities, with rated securities at investment grade Collateralized Loan Obligations CLOs MBS are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by agency/government-sponsored entities GSEs such as the GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. These securities are deemed to have high credit ratings, and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies. Collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs are bonds that are backed by pools of mortgages. The pools can be GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC pools or they can be private-label pools. The CMOs are designed so that the mortgage collateral will generate a cash flow sufficient to provide for the timely repayment of the bonds. The mortgage collateral pool can be structured to accommodate various desired bond repayment schedules, provided that the collateral cash flow is adequate to meet scheduled bond payments. This is accomplished by dividing the bonds into classes to which payments on the underlying mortgage pools are allocated. The bond s cash flow, for example, can be dedicated to one class of bondholders at a time, thereby increasing call protection to bondholders. In private-label CMOs, losses on underlying mortgages are directed to the most junior of all classes and then to the classes above in order of increasing seniority, which means that the senior classes have enough credit protection to be given the highest credit rating by the rating agencies. Obligations of states and political subdivisions (municipal securities) are purchased with consideration of the current tax position of the Bank. Both taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds may be purchased, but only after careful assessment of the market risk of the security. Appropriate credit evaluation must be performed prior to purchasing municipal bonds.

 Primis corporate bonds consist of senior and/or subordinated notes issued by banks. Bank subordinated debt, if rated, must be of investment grade and non-rated bonds are permissible if the credit-worthiness of the issuer has been properly analyzed. CLOs are actively managed securitization vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of senior secured corporate bank loans, otherwise known as broadly syndicated loans . The loan portfolio is transferred to bankruptcy-remote special-purpose vehicle, which finances the acquisition through the issuance of various classes of debt and equity securities with varying levels of senior claim on the underlying loan portfolio. CLOs must be rated AA or better at the time of purchase. We classify our investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt investment securities that Primis has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Investment securities totaling 13.5 million were in the held-to-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2022, compared to 22.9 million at December 31, 2021. Investment securities totaling 236.3 million were in the available-for-sale portfolio at December 31, 2022, compared to 271.3 million at December 31, 2021. During 2022 and 2021, 37.4 million and 160.5 million, respectively, of available-for-sale investment securities were purchased. No held-to-maturity investments were purchased in 2022 or 2021. No investment securities were sold during 2022 or 2021. Investment securities in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amount of 113.4 million; corporate bonds in the amount of 14.8 million; collateralized loan obligations of 4.9 million; residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations in the amount of 26.9 million; callable agency securities in the amount of 14.6 million; commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amount of 37.4 million; SBA loan pool securities in the amount of 5.98 million; and municipal bonds in the amount of 36.8 million (fair value of 31.9 million) with a taxable equivalent yield of 2.56

 The following table sets forth the amortized cost, fair value, and weighted average yield of our investment securities by contractual maturity at December 31, 2022. Weighted average yield is calculated as the tax-equivalent yield on a pro rata basis for each security based on its relative amortized cost. Yields on tax-exempt securities have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties (in thousands).

 Deposits and Other Borrowings The market for deposits is competitive. We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, advertising and online banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending, purchasing of investment securities and for other business purposes. Total deposits decreased 1.5 to 2.7 billion at December 31, 2022 from 2.8 billion at December 31, 2021. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased from 530.3 million as of December 31, 2021 to 582.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Time deposits increased from 360.6 million to 465.1 million and savings accounts increased from 222.9 million to 245.8 million over the same period. The following table sets forth the average balance and average rate paid on each of the deposit categories for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the effect of such retention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general economy and market rates of interest.

We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and interest rates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with our FHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, total FHLB borrowings were 325.0 million and 100.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, we had 437.7 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit. Other borrowings can consist of FHLB convertible advances, FHLB overnight advances, other FHLB advances maturing within one year, federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance in repo accounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 6.4 million and 10.0 million, respectively.

The trust issuer invested the total proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was 10.3 million outstanding, net of approximately 0.6 million of debt issuance costs. These securities pay cumulative cash distributions quarterly at a variable rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.95 . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the interest rate was 7.69 and 3.17 , respectively. The dividends paid to holders of these securities, which are recorded as interest expense, are deductible for income tax purposes. The trust preferred securities may be included in Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital adequacy determination purposes up to 25 of Tier 1 capital after its inclusion. At December 31, 2022, all of the trust preferred securities qualified as Tier 1 capital. On January 20, 2017, Primis completed the sale of 27.0 million of its fixed-to-floating rate senior Subordinated Notes due 2027. These notes initially bore interest at 5.875 per annum until January 31, 2022; interest is currently payable at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 3.95 until maturity or early redemption. At December 31, 2022, 80 of these notes qualified as Tier 2 capital. In 2017, the Company assumed a Senior Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement, dated April 22, 2015, entered into with certain institutional accredited investors, pursuant to which 20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.50 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2025 was sold to the investors. On February 1, 2021, the Company redeemed all of these notes. On August 25, 2020, Primis completed the sale of 60.0 million of its fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. These notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 5.40 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2021. From and including September 1, 2025 to, but excluding the maturity date or the date of earlier redemption (the floating rate period ), the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the Benchmark rate, which is expected to be three-month Term SOFR, plus 531 basis points, for each quarterly interest period during the floating rate period, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Benchmark rate is less than zero, the Benchmark rate shall be deemed to be zero. At December 31, 2022, all of these notes qualified as Tier 2 capital.

 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk We are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability Committee ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk. We use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk, and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using assumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. The following tables are based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 100 basis points, measured in 100 basis point increments) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. All changes are within our Asset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines.

 Our interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in the net interest income NII over a range of interest rate scenarios. NII depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at December 31, 2022 and 2021 remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are within our ALM Policy guidelines at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Modeling changes in EVE and NII sensitivity requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE tables and NII tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII. Sensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches. Liquidity and Funds Management The objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund commitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits are not sufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, institutional certificates of deposit and the sale of available-for-sale investment securities. In addition, we maintain federal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks and utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers. For additional information about borrowings and anticipated principal repayments refer to the discussion about Contractual Obligations below and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 Securities Sold Under Agreements To Repurchase And Other Short-Term Borrowings and Note 12 Junior Subordinated Debt and Senior Subordinated Notes.

 We prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and a two year basis. The projections incorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate risk analyses. At December 31, 2022, we had 540.6 million of unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds. The amount of certificate of deposit accounts maturing in less than one year was 338.4 million as of December 31, 2022. Management anticipates that funding requirements for these commitments can be met from the normal sources of funds. As of December 31, 2022, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, Primis has no material commitments or long-term debt for capital expenditures. Capital Resources Capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp. and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under regulatory framework for PCA. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December 31, 2022, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. See Item 1. Business, Supervision and Regulation Capital Requirements for more information. The following table provides a comparison of the leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios of Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank at the periods indicated to the minimum and well-capitalized required regulatory standards:

 (1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level. 
 Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory authorities. Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines Basel III aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had a capital conservation buffer of 5.59 at December 31, 2022, which exceeded the 2.50 minimum requirement below which the regulators may impose limits on distributions. Primis Bank s capital position is consistent with being well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The financial statements and related financial data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A concerning Primis Financial Corp. have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Many factors impact interest rates, including the FRB, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Like most financial institutions, changes in interest rates can impact our net interest income which is the difference between interest earned from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Our interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the Bank s Asset/Liability Management Committee (the Asset/Liability Committee ). The Asset/Liability Committee has established policies and limits for management to monitor, measure and coordinate our sources, uses and pricing of funds. The Asset/Liability Committee makes reports to the board of directors on a quarterly basis. Seasonality and Cycles We do not consider our commercial banking business to be seasonal. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Primis is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and guarantees of credit card accounts. These instruments involve elements of credit and funding risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by Primis to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. We had letters of credit outstanding totaling 10.7 million and 13.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed 

 63 

Table of Contents 
 expiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling 540.6 million and 411.0 million, respectively. Virtually all of our unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds are variable rate. Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 4 - Loans and Allowance, as if such commitments were funded. Item 7A.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders, Board of Directors, and Audit Committee Primis Financial Corp. Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Primis Financial Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We did not audit the financial statements of Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC STM for the year ended December 31, 2020. STM, an affiliate of the Company as of December 31, 2020, was accounted for as an equity method investment. The Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 reported income from discontinued operations 8.4 million, or approximately 36 of the Company s net income. STM s financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report was furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for STM for the year ended December 31, 2020, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 15, 2023 (except as to the effects of the material weakness described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (revised and restated), as to which the date is October 4, 2024), expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting because of the material weakness described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements As discussed in Notes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 13, 17, 18, 19, and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2022 consolidated financial statements have been restated to correct the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows, as well as certain footnote disclosures to the consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

Table of Contents 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Credit Losses The Company s allowance for credit losses (ACL) on loans held for investment was 34.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The determination of the ACL has been identified by the Company as a critical accounting policy. The ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar loan risk characteristics exist, and by individually evaluating loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. As further described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company measures the ACL using a combination of probability of default (PD), probability of attrition (PA), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD), calculated based on the application of historical loss experience, and adjusted for a reasonable and supportable forecast. Estimates are qualitatively adjusted for risk factors that are not considered within the quantitative modeling process. Estimating an appropriate allowance requires management to make numerous assumptions about losses that will occur over the remaining contractual life of loans recorded as of the balance sheet date. The most significant judgments in the ACL as of December 31, 2022 included the determination of a reasonable and supportable forecast and the impact of qualitative factors. We identified the Company s estimate of the ACL as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination were the degree of subjectivity and judgment required to audit management s identification of reasonable and supportable forecasts and the identification and measurement of the qualitative factors. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management s determination of the ACL, including controls over: o Completeness and accuracy of inputs into the model used to determine the ACL; o The determination of a reasonable and supportable forecast, and; o The determination of qualitative factors. 
 We evaluated management s application of and changes to qualitative adjustments, including testing the accuracy of the supporting calculations, evaluating whether the qualitative factors appropriately addressed risks that were not fully accounted for in the quantitative ACL component 

 66 

Table of Contents 
 of the methodology, and evaluating the appropriateness and level of the qualitative factor adjustments. We evaluated management s determination of a reasonable and supportable forecast, including testing the application of the forecast in quantitative ACL calculation. We also utilized our internal valuation specialists to assist us in testing the application of the forecast to the ACL calculation. We tested the mathematical accuracy of the ACL, including the mathematical application of the qualitative adjustments on the loan segments. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessment The Company has recorded goodwill of 104.6 million as of December 31, 2022. The determination of the annual goodwill impairment assessment has been identified by the Company as a critical accounting policy. As further described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, occurring as of September 30th every year, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist in performing its quantitative impairment analysis, which included a combination of valuation approaches to determine the fair value of the Bank reporting unit. These valuation approaches required certain assumptions such as the discount rate, economic conditions impacting interest and growth rates, the control premium, and a relative weighting given to the fair value derived by each of the valuation approaches used. We identified the Company s quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for the Bank reporting unit, as of September 30, as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination were the degree of subjectivity and judgment required to audit management s goodwill impairment assessment. Specifically, evaluating the valuation approaches selected and key assumptions used by management in performing its assessment, such as the selection of comparable publicly-traded companies and control premium utilized in the valuation approaches. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to management s goodwill impairment assessment including controls over management s review of the quantitative analysis performed on the Bank reporting unit, including the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Bank reporting unit. We tested key financial data used within the valuation approaches by agreeing key inputs to internal and external sources. We evaluated, with the assistance of our internal valuation specialists, appropriateness of valuation approaches selected by management, the selection of a control premium and of comparable publicly-traded companies, and the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the Bank reporting unit.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders, Board of Directors, and Audit Committee Primis Financial Corp. Opinion on the Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Primis Financial Corp. s (the Company internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment. The Company s controls around the accounting evaluation for a complex agreement with a third-party that sources and manages a portfolio of consumer loans for the Company. The existing process did not appropriately facilitate a thorough evaluation of the entire transaction and did not include the involvement of individuals with the necessary expertise to enable identification of complex accounting matters in the agreement and to conclude on them. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of auditing procedures applied in our audit of the Company s consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 15, 2023 (except for the restatement described in Notes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 13, 17, 18, 19, and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, as to which the date is October 4, 2024), on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated March 15, 2023 (except for the restatement described in Notes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 13, 17, 18, 19, and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, as to which the date is October 4, 2024), expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. As described in management s report on internal control over financial reporting, the scope of management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has excluded Primis Mortgage Company Primis Mortgage, formerly named SeaTrust Mortgage Company) acquired on May 31, 2022. We have also excluded Primis Mortgage from the scope of our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Primis Mortgage represented one percent of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022 and four percent of consolidated revenues for the year then ended. Definitions and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Forvis Mazars, LLP Tysons, Virginia March 15, 2023 (except for the material weakness, as to which the date is October 4, 2024)

 with a much shorter effective life due to amortization and pay downs. The Consumer Program is governed by multiple interrelated agreements including the loan agreement between the Bank and the customer and agreements with the TPOS. The structure of the Consumer Program is intended to generate loans that yield a targeted return to the Bank on a portfolio basis while also providing limited credit enhancement from the TPOS. Key characteristics of the combined arrangement include: The TPOS contributes funds to a reserve account at the time of origination to be used for future charge-offs if necessary. When a promotional loan pays off prior to the end of the promotional period, the customer owes no interest on the loan and any interest accrued during the period is waived. In that event, the TPOS reimburses the Bank for the interest the customer otherwise would have paid if the promotional period did not exist. Excess yield on the portfolio after realized charge-offs and above an agreed upon target rate due to the Bank is paid to the TPOS as a Performance Fee. In the event charge-offs exceed the amount available as a Performance Fee, the TPOS remits a portion of current period originations to reimburse for losses and, if necessary, releases funds from the reserve account. If charge-offs exceed the amounts above, they roll over to future periods to offset potential Performance Fees and subsequent reserve account fundings related to the portfolio. 
 Agreements with multiple counterparties, such as the customer and TPOS, are generally required to be accounted for separately in accordance with U.S. GAAP relevant to each unit of account even if the agreements are highly interrelated. As a result, the Company accounts for the Consumer Program under multiple units of account as follows:

 million and an asset of thousand, respectively, in its Consolidated Balance Sheets in the lines Consumer Program derivative liability and Other assets , respectively, related to the third-party agreement accounted for as a derivative. See Note 5, Derivatives, for additional information about the derivative and the assumptions used to determine its value. Mortgage Banking Derivatives and Financial Instruments Mortgage loan commitments known as interest rate lock commitments IRLCs that relate to the origination of a mortgage that will be held for sale upon funding are considered derivative instruments under the derivatives accounting guidance in ASC 815 , Derivatives and Hedging . Loan commitments that are classified as derivatives are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) . To-be-announced mortgage-backed securities trades TBA is a contract to buy or sell mortgage-backed securities on a specific date while the underlying mortgages are not announced until just prior to settlement. These TBA trades provide an economic hedge against the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from interest rate lock commitments. TBAs are accounted for under the derivatives accounting guidance in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging when either of the following conditions exist: (i) when settlement of the TBA trade is not expected to occur at the next regular settlement date (which is typically the next month) or (ii) a mechanism exists to settle the contract on a net basis. As a result, these instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the income statements . The fair value of the TBA trades is based on the gain or loss that would occur if the Company were to pair-off the trade at the measurement date. Forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both best efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are mandatory delivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Forward loan sale commitments that are best efforts are not derivatives but can be and have been accounted for at fair value, determined in a similar manner to those that are mandatory delivery. Forward loan sale commitments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the income statements. As of December 31, 2022 the Company recorded an asset of million and a liability of million in its Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, related to IRLCs, TBAs, and forward loan sale commitments mortgage banking derivatives ). As of December 31, 2021 the Company did not have any mortgage banking derivatives. See Note 5 for further discussion and assumptions used to value the derivatives.

 million. The fraud dated back to the origination of several loans to a customer in 2010. Management believes, on the advice of its counsel, its insurance broker and a third party forensic auditor, that the losses are recoverable under the Company s insurance policies and is working through the claims process. The Company has evaluated the effect of the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and believes the impact to prior years is immaterial to each respective period assessed. However, the Company s quantitative and qualitative assessments of the fraud losses on its projected 2023 annual earnings was expected to be material at the time the evaluation was performed as of June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Company made the decision to report the losses in the respective periods in which they were incurred in its future Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings by revising impacted periods beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of June 30, 2023. For all of its filings on and after June 30, 2023, the Company revised opening retained earnings of the earliest period presented for losses incurred in earlier periods and revised all prior periods presented in the filing for losses incurred related to the period. Accordingly, the Company has revised prior periods presented in this Form 10-K/A to reflect the fraud losses in the respective period incurred, with any losses incurred prior to January 1, 2020 adjusted in the January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings balance. The revisions resulted in retained earnings as of January 1, 2020 being million lower than previously reported in prior periods. The table below discloses the net change (increase or (decrease)) included in all the consolidated statements of net income (loss) line items in this Form 10-K/A compared to amounts disclosed for these line items in prior filings, as a result of the revisions discussed above.

Restatement of current year results During the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified an error in its accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP for the Consumer Program agreement. Management conducted an analysis of the error with the assistance of an independent third-party accounting firm that had relevant expertise in accounting for similar agreements under U.S. GAAP. Upon conclusion of the analysis management discussed the findings with its Audit Committee and independent auditor and determined after these discussions that the error was material to its previously reported consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additional details of the analysis including conclusions regarding relevant accounting treatment for the Consumer Program under U.S. GAAP are described above in the Third-Party Originated and Serviced Consumer Loan Portfolio section of this note.

With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities and (iv) internal forecasts. As of December 31, 2022, Primis did not have any allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. The unrealized losses related to investment securities available-for-sale identified as of December 31, 2022 or 2021, relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related impairment. Primis performs quantitative analysis and if needed, a qualitative analysis in this determination. As a result, none of the securities were deemed to require an allowance for credit losses. Primis has the ability and intent to retain these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover all unrealized losses.

Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower s debt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual status if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.

Troubled Debt Restructurings A modification is classified as a TDR if both of the following exist: (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) the Bank has granted a concession to the borrower. The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted, the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing (or is likely to experience) financial difficulty and whether a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether a modification is a TDR. Although each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, TDRs are typically modified through reduction in interest rates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there were TDR loans outstanding in the amount of million primarily due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on certain of the Bank s borrowers. There have been defaults of TDRs modified during the past twelve months.

Allowance For Credit Losses Loans The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but not limited to (i) commercial real estate - owner occupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv) commercial, (v) agricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is necessary. For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of inputs: (i) probability of default, (ii) probability of attrition, (iii) loss given default and (iv) exposure at

Management considered the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. Qualitative reserve adjustments were driven by key risk indicators, that management tracked on a pool-by-pool basis, which included loan-to-value, borrower debt service coverage exceptions and large concentrations. Updated peer groups were also determined in collaboration with the Company s CECL consultant. Management included banks in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania that were between 2.0 billion and 10.0 billion in asset size. The peer group population was further narrowed using statistical analysis with a focus on total loans, percent of charge-offs, portfolio yields, and percent of charge-offs during recession. While the asset range and geography were unchanged from the prior iteration, changes in the Primis portfolio and the portfolios of other institutions resulted in changes to the final peer groups. The most notable changes are in the construction and land development and residential 1-4 family peer groups, each of which displays less risk than the prior year's group. Other segments' groups are mostly consistent. Generally, the updated loss drivers displayed similar default expectations as compared to the prior models. allowance for credit losses has been recognized for PPP loans as such loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA.

Mortgage Banking Derivatives and Financial Instruments The Company enters into IRLCs interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with borrowers who have applied for a loan and have met certain credit and underwriting criteria. The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate. Best efforts and mandatory forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both best efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are mandatory delivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Forward loan sale commitments that are best efforts are not derivatives but can be and have been accounted for at fair value, determined in a similar manner to those that are mandatory delivery. Forward loan sale commitments are recorded on the balance sheet as derivative assets

 Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-recurring Basis: Loans We may be required to measure certain financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of amortized cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment. Collateral-dependent loans are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are evaluated individually. These collateral-dependent loans are deemed to be at fair value if there is an associated allowance for credit losses or if a charge-off has been recorded in the previous 12 months. Collateral values are determined using appraisals or other third-party value estimates of the subject property discounted based on estimated selling costs, generally between and , and immaterial adjustments for other external factors that may impact the marketability of the collateral. The weighted average discount for estimated selling costs applied was . Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are valued based on third-party appraisals less estimated disposal costs. Primis considers third party appraisals, as well as independent fair value assessments from realtors or persons involved in selling bank premises, furniture and equipment, in determining the fair value of particular properties. Accordingly, the valuation of assets held for sale is subject to significant external and internal judgment. Primis periodically reviews premises, furniture and equipment held for sale to determine if the fair value of the property, less disposal costs, has declined below its recorded book value and records any adjustments accordingly. Other Real Estate Owned OREO is evaluated at the time of acquisition and recorded at fair value as determined by independent appraisal or evaluation less cost to sell. In some cases appraised value is net of costs to sell. Selling costs have been in the range from to of collateral valuation at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Fair value is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. OREO is further evaluated quarterly for any additional impairment. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of OREO was and million, respectively. Assets held for sale

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the

 Credit loss expense Balance as of December 31, Commitments Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed expiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. We had million of loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2022, all of which contractually expire within thirty years.

The existing process did not appropriately facilitate a thorough evaluation of the agreements and transaction and did not include the involvement of individuals with the necessary expertise to enable identification of complex accounting matters in the agreement and to conclude on them. Management is currently remediating the material weakness including design of and testing new controls related to the accounting related to the weakness. Additional information regarding the foregoing is disclosed in this Form 10-K/A. Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 : The material weaknesses identified for the year ended December 31, 2023 were related to: accounting determinations for transfers of financial assets including lack of a formally designed process and procedure for evaluation of loan transfers. The existing procedures did not outline the process to be taken and individuals to be involved in assessment of the proper accounting for loan transfers and were not sufficient enough to facilitate a proper conclusion on loan transfer transactions. the process for evaluation of credit losses on the third party originated and managed consumer loan portfolio including evaluating recent actual loss history on the portfolio relative to previous model inputs. The existing process relies on publicly available peer data for historical credit loss characteristics to inform our allowance calculation because the portfolio is relatively new and did not have an extended credit loss history to serve as the primary source of credit loss history when constructing the model. Management did not have a detailed process for review of recent actual portfolio loss trends and incorporation of those trends into the allowance determination. accounting evaluation for a complex agreement with a third-party that originates and manages a portfolio of consumer loans for the Company. The existing process did not appropriately facilitate a thorough evaluation of the agreements and transaction and did not include the involvement of individuals with the necessary expertise to enable identification of complex accounting matters in the agreement and to conclude on them. Management is currently remediating the material weaknesses including (i) design of and testing new controls related to accounting analysis for loan transfer transactions, (ii) design of and testing new internal controls over its allowance for credit losses process related to more timely review and incorporation of portfolio-specific credit loss trends its allowance calculation process for the third party managed consumer loan portfolio, and (iii) implementing additional internal controls

The Company has authorized Forvis to respond fully to the inquiries of the Company s successor independent registered public accounting firm concerning the subject matter of the reportable events. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (Revised and Restated) (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management re-evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and identified a material weakness over the Company s internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2022,. The material weakness was related to the accounting evaluation for a complex agreement with a third-party that sources and manages a portfolio of consumer loans for the Company. The existing process did not appropriately facilitate a thorough evaluation of the entire transaction and did not include the involvement of individuals with the necessary expertise to enable identification of complex accounting matters in the agreement and to conclude on them. (b) Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Management of Primis Financial Corp. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Primis Financial Corp. we and our ), as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). As permitted by guidance provided by the Staff of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the scope of management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has excluded Primis Mortgage Company Primis Mortgage formerly named SeaTrust Mortgage Company) acquired on May 31, 2022. Primis Mortgage represented 1 percent of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022 and 4 percent of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. Primis Financial Corp. conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over Primis financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of December 31, 2022. The Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance level, because of the material weakness in internal controls, which was disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K on September 9, 2024. This material weakness resulted from the Company s implementation of changes to the accounting for a third-party managed consumer loan portfolio which was the subject of a pre-clearance consultation with the SEC s Office of the Chief Accountant as described in Form 12b-25 on March 18, 2024 Amendment No. 1 filed April 1, 2024, Form 12b-25 filed May 13, 2024 and Form 12b-25 filed August 12, 2024. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2022, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash-flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles

 Remediation Plans Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over the identification of complex agreements the Company enters into and ensuring the appropriate level of review of these agreements by an individual with the requisite accounting expertise. The Company is adding additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting to require appropriate levels of accounting management review of new transactions. Additionally, the Company will seek appropriate third-party accounting expertise when it determines a transaction contains complex arrangements that management does not have sufficient expertise to assess and conclude upon. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. Management may determine that additional measures are required to address control deficiencies, strengthen internal control over financial reporting, or it may determine to modify the remediation measures described above. The actions the Company is taking are subject to ongoing executive management review and are also subject to Audit Committee oversight. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate the material weaknesses, or if in the future, the Company identifies further material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors on a timely basis, and its condensed consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Forvis Mazars, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which report is included in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .

Except for the changes in connection with this integration of Primis Mortgage, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.5 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 As of March 6, 2023, Primis Financial Corp. PRIMIS has one class of securities, our common stock, registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK The following description of the terms and provisions of our common stock is qualified in its entirety by reference to our amended Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws or Virginia law applicable to us. For a more thorough understanding of the terms of our capital stock, you should refer to our amended Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. General We are authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of capital stock of which 45,000,000 are shares of common stock and 5,000,000 are shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. As of March 6, 2023, there were 24,685,458 shares of common stock outstanding held by 1,212 holders of record and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Common Stock General. Each share of PRIMIS common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other share of PRIMIS common stock. PRIMIS common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol FRST Dividends. PRIMIS shareholders are entitled to receive dividends or distributions that its board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for those payments. The payment of distributions by PRIMIS is subject to the restrictions of Virginia law applicable to the declaration of distributions by a corporation. A Virginia corporation generally may not authorize and make distributions if, after giving effect to the distribution, it would be unable to meet its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or if the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if it were dissolved at that time, to satisfy the preferential rights of shareholders whose rights are superior to the rights of those receiving the distribution. In addition, the payment of distributions to shareholders is subject to any prior rights of outstanding preferred stock. As a bank holding company, PRIMIS ability to pay dividends is affected by the ability of Primis Bank, its bank subsidiary, to pay dividends to the holding company. The ability of Primis Bank, as well as PRIMIS, to pay dividends in the future is, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of PRIMIS, the holders of shares of its common stock will be entitled to receive, after payment of all debts and liabilities of PRIMIS and after satisfaction of all liquidation preferences applicable to any preferred stock, all remaining assets of PRIMIS available for distribution in cash or in kind. Voting Rights. The holders of PRIMIS common stock are entitled to one vote per share and, in general, a majority of votes cast with respect to a matter is sufficient to authorize action upon routine matters. Holders of PRIMIS common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights. Directors are 

 elected by a plurality of the votes cast, and shareholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Directors and Classes of Directors. PRIMIS board of directors is divided into three classes with directors serving staggered three-year terms. Any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships are apportioned among the classes as evenly as possible. Under PRIMIS articles of incorporation, directors may be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of not less than 75 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in an election of directors. Cause for removal exists only if a director whose removal is proposed has been either declared incompetent by an order of a court, convicted of a felony or of an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than one year, or deemed liable by a court for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of such director s duties to PRIMIS. No Preemptive Rights; Redemption and Assessment. Holders of shares of PRIMIS will not be entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued. PRIMIS common stock is not subject to redemption or any sinking fund and the outstanding shares are fully paid and nonassessable. Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions in Our Amended Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Virginia Law Subject to the application of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (VSCA), the affirmative vote of the holders of more than two thirds of all votes entitled to be cast is generally required with respect to a merger, exchange offer or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Under the VSCA and our amended Articles of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken by our shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without a shareholder vote if a written consent is signed by the holders of the shares of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize such action at a meeting of shareholders at which all shares entitled to vote on such matter were present and voted. Virginia law provides for certain restrictions on extraordinary corporate transactions that may discourage the acquisition of control of Virginia corporations. We elected to opt out of those protective provisions. The provisions described below, to the extent applicable, will have the general effect of discouraging, or rendering more difficult, unfriendly takeover or acquisition attempts. Consequently, such provisions would be beneficial to current management in an unfriendly takeover attempt, but could have an adverse effect on shareholders who might wish to participate in such a transaction. However, we believe that such provisions are advantageous to our shareholders in that they will permit management and our shareholders to carefully consider and understand a proposed acquisition, lead to higher offering prices, and require a higher level of shareholder participation in the decision if the transaction is not approved by our board of directors. Staggered Board and Removal of Directors One class of our three classes of directors is elected annually. Directors serve for three-year terms. There is no cumulative voting for directors provided for in the amended Articles of Incorporation. As permitted by Virginia law, our amended Articles of Incorporation provide that where a corporation s directors are elected in classes that a director, or the entire board of directors, only may be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of not less than 75 of the shares entitled to vote generally in an election of directors. The provisions contained in our amended Articles of Incorporation relating to election of directors in staggered three-year classes and the supermajority vote required to remove a director tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire us because of the extra time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure. This also can affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to 
 2 

pay for our common stock, thereby reducing the amount a shareholder would receive in, for example, a tender offer for our common stock. Special Shareholder Meetings Our amended Articles of Incorporation also restrict the manner in which special meetings may be called. Under the VSCA, a corporation is permitted to provide for calling of special meetings either in its bylaws or articles of incorporation. Our amended Articles of Incorporation specify that special meetings may be called by our Chairman of the Board or President or by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the board of directors or by holders of record of not less than 40 of our then outstanding voting shares. Evaluation of Change in Control Offers Our amended Articles of Incorporation also provide that when evaluating any offer that may result in a change in control of our company, the board of directors may consider, consistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties and in connection with the exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, not only the price or other consideration being offered, but also all other relevant factors including, without limitation, the financial and management resources and future prospects of the other party, the possible effect on our business and the business of our subsidiaries and on our employees, customers, suppliers and creditors and those of our subsidiaries, the effects on the ability of our company to fulfill its corporate objectives as a holding company and on the ability of Primis Bank to fulfill its objectives as a bank, and the effects on the communities in which our facilities are located. Blank Check Preferred Stock In addition to common stock, our amended Articles of Incorporation permit the board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. Among other things, the board of directors in issuing a series of preferred stock has the power to determine voting powers, if any, of such series. Such issuance of preferred stock having voting rights could dilute the voting and ownership interest of existing shareholders. Such issuance may have the effect of discouraging unilateral attempts by third parties to obtain control of our company, since the issuance of additional shares of capital stock could be used to dilute the voting power of, or increase the cost to, any person seeking to obtain control of us. This may occur by virtue of the fact that the preferred stock may be issued in a series having rights in excess of one vote per share or having the right to vote separately by class respecting some matters. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent for PRIMIS common stock is Computershare Inc., 250 Royall Street, Canton, Massachusetts 02021.

If Executive s employment is terminated during the Employment Period on account of Executive s death or Disability, Executive (or Executive s estate or beneficiaries, as the case may be) shall be entitled to receive the following: (i) the Accrued Amounts; and (ii) a lump sum amount equal to the Pro-Rata Bonus, if any, that Executive would have earned for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs based on the achievement of applicable performance goals for such year, which amount shall be paid in cash on the date that annual bonuses are paid to senior executives of the Employer generally, but in no event later than two-and-one-half months following the end of the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all payments made in connection with Executive s Disability shall be provided in a manner that is consistent with federal and state law. 8. Non-Exclusivity of Rights . Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive s continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Employer and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Employer, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement.

 contract or agreement with the Employer at or subsequent to the Termination Date shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or such contract or agreement, except as expressly modified by this Agreement. 9.

Code Section 280G . (a) Certain Reductions in Agreement Payments . Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event a nationally recognized independent accounting firm designated by the Employer and reasonably acceptable to Executive (the Accounting Firm shall determine that receipt of all payments or distributions by the Employer and its affiliates in the nature of compensation to or for Executive s benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (a Payment ), would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine as required below in this Section 10(a) whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the Agreement Payments to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). The Agreement Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if Executive s Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if Executive s Agreement Payments were so reduced, then Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled. (b) Accounting Firm Determinations . If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, then the Employer shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 10 shall be binding upon the Employer and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 20 days following the Termination Date. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments to the Reduced Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order: first from Section 7(b)(iii), then from Section 7(b)(ii) and lastly from Section 7(b)(i). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Employer. (c) Overpayments; Underpayments . As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Employer to or for the benefit of Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (an Overpayment or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Employer to or for the benefit of Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should have been so paid or distributed (an Underpayment ), in each case consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Employer or Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, Executive shall pay any such Overpayment to the Employer together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided , however , that no amount shall be payable by Executive to the Employer if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Employer to or for the benefit of Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. (d) Definitions . The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section 10: (i) Reduced Amount shall mean the greatest amount of Agreement Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code if the Accounting Firm determines to reduce Agreement Payments pursuant to Section 10(a).

Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive has received good and valuable consideration in exchange for Executive s agreement to be bound by the restrictive covenants in this Section 11 and (ii) the Employer will provide certain benefits to Executive hereunder in reliance on such covenants in view of the unique and essential nature of the services Executive will perform on behalf of the Employer and the irreparable injury that would befall the Employer should Executive breach such covenants.

(b) Severability . If any provision or covenant, or any part thereof, of this Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality enforceability of the remaining provisions or covenants, or any part thereof, of this Agreement, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC (the Company) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Company is primarily engaged in the business of originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans through its retail origination channel. The Company maintains its corporate office in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with branch offices in multiple states. The Company is approved as a Title II, non-supervised direct endorsement mortgagee with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In addition, the Company is an approved issuer with the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), as well as an approved seller and servicer with the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Basis of Accounting The financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Consolidation, Variable Interest Entities The Company sells mortgage loans to FNMA and FHLMC, which are government-sponsored enterprises. The Company may also issue GNMA securities by pooling eligible mortgage loans through a custodian and assigning rights to the mortgage loans to GNMA. FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA (the Agencies) provide credit enhancements for mortgage loans through certain guarantee provisions. These securitizations involve variable interest entities (VIEs) as the trusts or similar vehicles, by design, that either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entities. 
 7 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Consolidation, Variable Interest Entities (Continued) The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company may retain the right to service mortgage loans sold or securitized by the Agencies. Due to the significant influence of the Agencies over the VIEs that hold the assets from mortgage loan securitizations, principally through their rights and responsibilities as master servicer, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and therefore the VIEs are not consolidated. The Company performs on-going reassessments of (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore become subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company s involvement with a VIE cause the Company s consolidation determination to change. Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash flow purposes, the Company considers cash and temporary investments with original maturities of three months or less, to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company has diversified its credit risk for cash by maintaining deposits in several financial institutions, which may at times exceed amounts covered by insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of these financial institutions in determining the risk associated with these balances. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents. Restricted Cash The Company maintains certain cash balances that are restricted under warehouse agreements. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Revenue Recognition Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option with changes in fair value recorded in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statement of operations. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale committed to investors is calculated using observable market information such as the investor purchase commitment, assignment of trade or other mandatory delivery commitment prices. The Company bases loans committed to Agency investors based on the Agency s quoted mortgage backed security (MBS) prices. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors is based on quoted best execution secondary market prices. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, such as MBS prices, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan, which would be used by other market participants.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Revenue Recognition (Continued) Gains and losses from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale are recognized based upon the difference between the sales proceeds and carrying value of the related loans upon sale and are recorded in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statement of operations. Sales proceeds reflect the cash received from investors through the sale of the loan and servicing release premium. If the related mortgage servicing right (MSR) is sold servicing retained, the MSR addition is recorded in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statement of operations. Gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale also includes the unrealized gains and losses associated with the changes in the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and the realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments. Mortgage loans held for sale are considered sold when the Company surrenders control over the financial assets. Control is considered to have been surrendered when the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; the purchaser obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific financial assets. The Company typically considers the above criteria to have been met upon acceptance and receipt of sales proceeds from the purchaser. Mortgage Loans Held for Investment, Net Mortgage loans held for investment for which management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or to maturity are carried at amortized cost reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses. Mortgage loans transferred from the held for sale category are transferred at the lower of cost or fair value, which becomes the new cost basis in the loans. Real Estate Owned Real estate owned is initially recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of foreclosure on the delinquent mortgage loans, which becomes the new cost basis in the real estate owned. The fair value of real estate owned is determined, when possible, using observable market data, including recent real estate appraisals and broker price opinions. Costs incurred in managing and maintaining foreclosed real estate and subsequent declines in fair value are charged to operations as incurred and are included in general and administrative on the statement of operations. The Company periodically assesses real estate owned for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its fair value. If real estate owned is considered impaired, the impairment losses will be recorded on the statement of operations.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Loan Origination Fees Loan origination fees represent revenue earned from originating mortgage loans. Loan origination fees generally represent a flat per-loan fee amount based on a percentage of the original principal loan balance and are recognized as revenue at the time the mortgage loans are funded. Loan origination expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Interest Income Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized for the period from loan funding to sale based upon the principal balance outstanding and contractual interest rates. Revenue recognition is discontinued when loans become 90 days delinquent, or when, in management s opinion, the recovery of principal and interest becomes doubtful and the mortgage loans held for sale are put on nonaccrual status. Revenue Recognition FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) , establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The majority of the Company s revenue generating transactions are not subject to ASC 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as the Company s mortgage loans and derivatives, as well as revenue related to the Company s mortgage servicing activities. Loan Servicing Fees and Expenses Loan servicing fees represent revenue earned for servicing loans for various investors. Loan servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding unpaid principal balance and are recognized into revenue as the related mortgage payments are received. Loan servicing expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Servicing Advances Servicing advances represent escrows advanced by the Company on behalf of borrowers and investors to cover delinquent balances for property taxes, insurance premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. Servicing advances are made in accordance with the Company s servicing agreements and are recoverable upon collection of future borrower payments, sale of loan collateral, reimbursement by investor, or mortgage insurance claims. The Company periodically reviews servicing advances for collectability and establishes a valuation allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts. No allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2021, as management has determined that all amounts are fully collectible.

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following is a summary of property and equipment at December 31, 2021:

 (a) Amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. The Company periodically assesses property and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its fair value. If property and equipment is considered impaired, the impairment losses will be recorded on the statement of operations. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2021.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Derivative Instruments The Company holds and issues derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and forward sale commitments. IRLCs are subject to price risk primarily related to fluctuations in market interest rates. To hedge the interest rate risk on mandatory IRLCs, the Company uses forward sale commitments, such as to-be-announced securities or mandatory delivery commitments with investors. Management expects these forward sale commitments to experience changes in fair value opposite to the changes in fair value of the IRLCs, thereby reducing earnings volatility. Forward sale commitments are also used to hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans held for sale that are not committed to investors and still subject to price risk. If the mandatory delivery commitments are not fulfilled, the Company pays a pair-off fee. Best effort forward sale commitments are also executed with investors, whereby certain loans are locked with a borrower and simultaneously committed to an investor at a fixed price. If the best effort IRLC does not fund, the Company has no obligation to fulfill the investor commitment. The Company considers various factors and strategies in determining what portion of the IRLCs and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale to economically hedge. FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and gains and losses resulting from pairing-out of forward sale commitments are recognized in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statement of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company accounts for all derivative instruments as free-standing derivative instruments and does not designate any for hedge accounting. Mortgage Servicing Rights and Revenue Recognition FASB ASC 860-50, Transfers and Servicing , requires that MSRs be initially recorded at fair value at the time the underlying loans are sold. To determine the fair value of the MSR created, the Company uses a valuation model, along with currently available market information including rate sheets from aggregators, that calculates the net present value of future cash flows. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing revenue, including the estimated discount rate, estimated prepayment speeds, the cost of servicing, estimated delinquencies, contractual service fees, ancillary income and late fees, float value, the inflation rate, and default rates. The credit quality and stated interest rates of the forward loans underlying the MSRs affects the assumptions used in the cash flow models. MSRs are not actively traded in open markets; accordingly, considerable judgment is required to estimate their fair value, and changes in these estimates could materially change the estimated fair value. The Company receives a monthly fixed servicing fee based on the outstanding principal balances of the mortgage loans, which is collected from investors. 
 12 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Mortgage Servicing Rights and Revenue Recognition (Continued) After initially recording the MSRs at fair value, the Company subsequently amortizes the MSRs over the estimated economic life of the related mortgage loans in proportion to the estimated future net servicing revenue. The net capitalized cost of MSRs is periodically evaluated to determine if the amortized cost of MSRs is in excess of their estimated fair value. For this purpose, the Company stratifies its MSRs based on loan term, interest rate and product type, with estimates of remaining loan lives and prepayment rates being incorporated into the model. When impairment is identified due to the MSR asset s amortized book value exceeding its fair value, management records a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances are recorded as a reduction to the MSRs on the balance sheet. Any impairment of the amortized cost of MSRs is assessed based on their fair value at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans serviced and stratification based on risk characteristics of the underlying loans (predominantly interest rates). As interest rates decrease, mortgage refinancing activity may increase, resulting in higher prepayment speeds of the loans underlying MSRs, which may result in a reduction of the MSRs fair value. Such fair value adjustment may require an additional valuation allowance being charged to earnings, to the extent that the amortized cost of the MSR exceeds the estimated fair value from stratification. Conversely, as mortgage interest rates rise, prepayment speeds are usually slower and the value of the MSR asset generally increases, requiring less valuation allowance. If it is later determined that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a stratification, the valuation allowance is reduced through a recovery to earnings. An other-than-temporary impairment (i.e. recoverability is considered remote when considering interest rates and loan pay-off activity) is recognized as a write-down of the MSR asset and the related valuation allowance. A direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of the MSR asset and valuation allowance, precluding subsequent recoveries. The key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of MSRs when they are initially recorded are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2021: Inputs Discount rates 11.00 - 11.42 Annual prepayment speeds 11.67 - 21.40 Average cost of servicing 85 
 Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights A transfer of servicing rights related to loans previously sold qualifies as a sale at the date on which title passes, if substantially all risks and rewards of ownership have irrevocably passed to the transferee and any protection provisions retained by the transferor are minor and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, if a sale is recognized and only minor protection provisions exist, a liability should be accrued for the estimated obligation associated with those provisions.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Loan Indemnification Reserve Loans sold to investors by the Company and which met investor and Agency underwriting guidelines at the time of sale may be subject to repurchase in the event of specific default by the borrower or subsequent discovery that underwriting standards were not met. The Company may, upon mutual agreement, indemnify the investor against future losses on such loans. The Company has established a reserve for potential losses related to these representations and warranties. In assessing the adequacy of the reserve, management evaluates various factors including actual write-offs during the period, historical loss experience, known delinquent and other problem loans, and economic trends and conditions in the industry. Actual losses incurred are reflected as write-offs against the loan indemnification reserve. The activity in the loan indemnification reserve for mortgage loans held for sale is as follows for the year ended December 31, 2021: 

Amounts Balance, beginning of year 1,325,068 Recovery of loan losses (485,847) Loans written-off, net of recoveries (273,050) Balance, end of year 566,171 
 Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates underlying the loan indemnification reserve, there is a range of losses in excess of the recorded loan indemnification reserve that is reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss for representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss and is based on current available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Valuation Allowance on Mortgage Loans Held for Investment, Net The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of mortgage loans held for investment in excess of fair value and establishes a valuation allowance for potential losses. In assessing the adequacy of the valuation allowance, management evaluates various factors on a loan level basis, including the probability of not being able to collect payments based on the contractual terms of the mortgage, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and probable losses inherent to the loan portfolio. Additions to and recovery of the valuation allowance are reflected in the provision for loan losses on the statement of operations.

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Valuation Allowance on Mortgage Loans Held for Investment, Net (Continued) The activity in the valuation allowance for mortgage loans held for investment, net is as follows for the year ended December 31, 2021: Amounts Balance, beginning of year 89,435 Provision for loan losses 65,799 Loans written-off, net of recoveries (66,962) Balance, end of year 88,272 
 Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates underlying the valuation allowance, there is a range of losses in excess of the recorded valuation allowance that is reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss does not represent a probable loss and is based on current available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Escrow and Fiduciary Funds The Company maintains segregated bank accounts for escrow balances in trust for investors for mortgagors. The balances of these accounts amounted to 6,755 at December 31, 2021, and are excluded from the balance sheet. Advertising and Marketing Advertising and marketing is expensed as incurred and amounted to 1,720,731 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and is included in general and administrative on the statement of operations. Income Taxes The Company has elected to be taxed as a partnership under the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, no federal income tax provision and state income taxes, to the extent possible, have been recorded in the financial statements, as all items of income and expense generated by the Company are reported on the members income tax returns. The Company has no federal or state tax examinations in process as of December 31, 2021. Risks and Uncertainties In the normal course of business, companies in the mortgage banking industry encounter certain economic and regulatory risks. Economic risks include interest rate risk and credit risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that in a rising interest rate environment, the Company may experience a decrease in loan production, as well as decreases in the value of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors and commitments to originate loans, which may negatively impact the Company s operations. Credit risk is the risk of default that may result from the borrowers inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments during the period in which loans are being held for sale or serviced by the Company.

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Risks and Uncertainties (Continued) The Company sells loans to investors without recourse. As such, the investors have assumed the risk of loss or default by the borrower. However, the Company is usually required by these investors to make certain standard representations and warranties relating to credit information, loan documentation and collateral. To the extent that the Company does not comply with such representations, or there are early payment defaults, the Company may be required to repurchase the loans or indemnify these investors for any losses from borrower defaults. In addition, if loans pay-off within a specified time frame, the Company may be required to refund a portion of the sales proceeds to the investors. The Company s business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities. As a result, the Company is dependent on its warehouse lines of credit, and other financing facilities in order to finance its continued operations. If the Company s principal lenders decided to terminate or not to renew any of these financing facilities with the Company, the loss of borrowing capacity could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements unless the Company found a suitable alternative source. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted economic markets, and the prolonged economic impact is uncertain. The operational and financial performance of the Company depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, and such uncertainty may have an adverse impact on the Company s financial performance.

 D. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ADVANCES The following summarizes accounts receivable and advances at December 31, 2021: 

Amounts Loan sales receivable 304,740 Loan funding receivable 125,659 Due from borrower 128,893 Servicing advances 52,635 MSR co-issue receivable 610,706 MSR sale receivable 416,000 Pair-off receivable 16,758 1,655,391 
 The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of accounts receivable and advance balances with delinquent balances written-off based on specific credit evaluations and circumstances of the debtor. No allowance for doubtful accounts has been established at December 31, 2021, as management has determined that all amounts are fully collectible. E. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with borrowers who have applied for a loan and have met certain credit and underwriting criteria. The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate. The key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of IRLCs are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2021: 

Inputs Average pullthrough rates 88.48 - 90.01 Average cost to originate 1.24

 E. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (Continued) The following summarizes derivative instruments at December 31, 2021: Amounts Fair Notional Value Amount IRLCs: Mandatory 2,318,128 103,858,000 (b) Best efforts 163,838 38,531,000 (b) MBSs (48,773) 121,000,000 Total 2,433,193 
 (b) Pullthrough rate adjusted The notional amounts of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors amounted to approximately 28,172,000 at December 31, 2021. The Company has exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by its trading counterparties in derivative instruments that the Company uses in its rate risk management activities. The Company manages this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that the Company believes to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple counterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by entering into netting agreements with counterparties, as appropriate. F. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS The following summarizes the activity of MSRs for the year ended December 31, 2021: Amounts Balance, beginning of year 1,694,970 Additions due to loans sold, servicing retained 467,651 Deletions due to sale of MSRs (1,877,032) Deletions due to loan payoffs (121,869) Amortization expense (132,218) Balance, end of year 31,502 
 
 18 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 F. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (Continued) At December 31, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced approximated 1,852,000. Conforming conventional loans serviced by the Company are sold to FNMA and FHLMC on a non-recourse basis, whereby foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of FNMA and FHLMC, and not the Company. The government loans serviced by the Company are secured through GNMA, whereby the Company is insured against loss by the Federal Housing Administration or partially guaranteed against loss by the Veterans Administration. The key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of the Company s MSRs are as follows at December 31, 2021: 

Inputs Discount rates 11.42 Annual prepayment speeds 11.67 Average cost of servicing 85 
 The hypothetical effect of an adverse change in these key unobservable inputs would result in a decrease in fair value as follows at December 31, 2021 : Amounts Discount rates: Effect on value - 1 adverse change (1,153) Effect on value - 2 adverse change (2,224) Prepayment speeds: Effect on value - 5 adverse change (585) Effect on value - 10 adverse change (1,147) Cost of servicing: Effect on value - 5 adverse change (136) Effect on value - 10 adverse change (271) 
 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the table demonstrates, the Company s methodology for estimating the fair value of MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in key unobservable inputs. For example, actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on MSR fair value. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in inputs generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in input to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular input on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other input; in reality, changes in one factor may be associated with changes in another (for example, decreases in market interest rates may indicate higher prepayments; however, this may be partially offset by lower prepayments due to other factors such as a borrower s diminished opportunity to refinance), which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Thus, any measurement of MSR fair value is limited by the conditions existing and inputs made as of a particular point in time. Those inputs may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different point in time.

 F. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (Continued) The following table summarizes the Company s estimated future MSR amortization expense. These estimates are based on existing asset balances, the current interest rate environment, and prepayment speeds as of December 31, 2021. The actual amortization expense the Company recognizes in any given period may be significantly different depending upon acquisition or sale activities, changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds, market conditions, or circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Year Ending December 31, Amounts 2022 7,825 2023 6,163 2024 4,521 2025 3,436 2026 2,571 Thereafter 6,986 31,502 
 Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold the majority of its MSR portfolio with an unpaid principal balance of approximately 565,502,000 for a net sales price of 4,946,499, which includes the gross sales prices of 5,315,715 less 369,216 for transactional expenses. The Company recognized a gain on sale of 3,069,467 which is recorded in gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights on the statement of operations. In addition, the Company recorded a receivable totaling 416,000, at December 31, 2021, related to the sale, which is due when all of the complete mortgage files have been received by the purchaser. The Company performed temporary sub-servicing activities with respect to the underlying loans through the established transfer date, for which the Company earned a fee and is also entitled to certain other ancillary income amounts. G. CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS The Company leases equipment with a capitalized cost of 642,979 and a book value of 620,749 under the capital lease agreement expiring August 2023. The capital lease agreement calls for aggregate monthly payments of 27,168 with interest imputed of 1.75 per annum. The following is a schedule of the future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2021: Year Ending December 31, Amounts 2022 320,528 2023 135,321 455,849

 M. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN The Company has a 401(k) qualified retirement plan covering substantially all employees. Employees may contribute amounts subject to certain Internal Revenue Service and plan limitations. The Company may make discretionary matching and non-elective contributions. The Company made no contributions to the plan for the year ended December 31, 2021. N. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments to Extend Credit The Company enters into IRLCs with customers who have applied for residential mortgage loans and meet certain credit and underwriting criteria. These commitments expose the Company to market risk if interest rates change and the underlying loan is not economically hedged or committed to an investor. The Company is also exposed to credit loss if the loan is originated and not sold to an investor and the mortgagor does not perform. The collateral upon extension of credit typically consists of a first deed of trust in the mortgagor s residential property. Commitments to originate loans do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements as some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Total commitments to originate loans approximated 158,934,000 at December 31, 2021. Regulatory Contingencies The Company is subject to periodic audits and examinations, both formal and informal in nature, from various federal and state agencies, including those made as part of regulatory oversight of mortgage origination, servicing and financing activities. Such audits and examinations could result in additional actions, penalties or fines by state or federal governmental bodies, regulators or the courts. Operating Leases The Company leases office space and equipment under various operating lease arrangements, which expire through August 2028. Total rent expense under all operating leases amounted to 2,328,066 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and is included in occupancy, equipment and communication on the statement of operations.

 N. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Legal The Company operates in a highly regulated industry and may be involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. The amount, if any, of ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, but despite the inherent uncertainties of litigation, management currently believes that the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings and exposure will not have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. However, actual outcomes may differ from those expected and could have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations or cash flows in a future period. The Company accrues for losses when they are probable to occur, and such losses are reasonably estimable. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative on the statement of operations. Regulatory Net Worth Requirements In accordance with the regulatory requirements of HUD, governing non-supervised, direct endorsement mortgagees, the Company is required to maintain a minimum net worth (as defined by HUD) of 2,500,000. At December 31, 2021, the Company exceeded the regulatory net worth requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements of GNMA, governing issuers of GNMA securities, the Company is required to maintain a minimum net worth (as defined by GNMA) of 2,727,272. At December 31, 2021, the Company exceeded the regulatory net worth requirement. Self-Insurance Plan The Company has engaged an insurance company to provided administrative services for the Company s self-funded insurance plan. The Company pays the qualifying medical claims expense for all participating individuals. The Company has a stop loss policy with the insurance company whereby they are reimbursed for all qualifying medical expenses incurred by individual employees above 1,879,984 in the aggregate. In addition, the Company is reimbursed for all aggregate medical expenses incurred by all participating individuals above 100,000 per the stop loss agreement. The Company has accrued for expenses related to incurred but not reported claims totaling 127,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet. O. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not assumptions specific to the entity. 
 25 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 O. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon the market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). In accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Inputs Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs Inputs other than the quoted market prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Inputs Inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different methods or assumptions to estimate the fair value of certain financial statement items could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement may result in significantly different fair value measurements if any of those inputs were to change in isolation. Generally, a change in the assumptions used in the fair value measurement would be accompanied by a directionally opposite change in other assumptions. Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market for such items existed, or had such items been liquidated, and those differences could be material to the financial statements. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2021. Mortgage loans held for sale (MLHFS) The fair value of MLHFS based on Level 2 inputs is determined, when possible, using either quoted secondary-market prices or investor commitments. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan, which would be used by other market participants. 
 26 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 O. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Mortgage loans held for investment The fair value of mortgage loans held for investment is determined based on observable market information, including pricing from actual market transactions or broker quotations. Derivative instruments The fair value of IRLCs is based on valuation models incorporating market pricing for instruments with similar characteristics, commonly referred to as best execution pricing, or investor commitment prices for best effort IRLCs. The valuation models used to value the IRLCs have unobservable inputs, such as an estimate of the fair value of the servicing rights expected to be recorded upon sale of the loans, estimated costs to originate the loans, and the pullthrough rate, and are therefore classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of forward sale commitments is based on observable market pricing for similar instruments and are therefore classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Mortgage servicing rights The fair value of MSRs is difficult to determine because MSRs are not actively traded in observable stand-alone markets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting net servicing cash flows discounted at a rate that management believes market participants would use in their determinations of fair value. The key unobservable inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include prepayment speeds, discount rates, default rates, cost to service, contractual servicing fees, escrow earnings and ancillary income. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value The following are the major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021: 

Description Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total MLHFS 85,968,910 85,968,910 Derivative instruments (48,773) 2,481,966 2,433,193 Total 85,920,137 2,481,966 88,402,103 
 The Company does not have any impaired assets or liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2021.

 O. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value (Continued) The following are the changes in fair value of Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the year ended December 31, 2021: 

Description Amounts MLHFS (4,016,702) Derivative instruments 2,447,829 Total (1,568,873) 
 Level 3 Purchases, Issuances and Transfers The following is a summary of the Company s purchases, issuances, and transfers of assets, as applicable, which are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis using Level 3 inputs during the year ended December 31, 2021: 

MSRs IRLCs Issuances (c) 467,651 46,371,695 Transfers out of Level 3 (d) 83,297,014 
 (c) Issuances of Level 3 MSRs represent current year additions from mortgage loans sold servicing retained. Issuances of Level 3 IRLCs represent the lock-date fair value of IRLCs issued to borrowers during the year, net of the estimated pullthrough rate and costs to originate. (d) IRLCs transferred out of Level 3 represent IRLCs that were funded and transferred to mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, escrow cash, short-term receivables, due from related parties, short-term payables, related party note payable, capital lease obligations, and warehouse lines of credit approximate their fair value at December 31, 2021. P. MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Primis Bank (the Seller), in which the Company purchased all of the Seller s Common Membership Shares, and 300,000 Preferred Membership Shares. Prior to the sale, the Seller owned 3,801,374 Common Membership Shares, 3,304,666 Preferred Membership Shares, and 4,890 Voting Units of the issued and outstanding membership interests of the Company. The purchase price for the purchased interest was 10,050,000; consisting of 1,550,000 in cash and a 8,500,000 unsecured promissory note, as referenced in Note I, due to mature in December 2031.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC Virginia Beach, Virginia Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements of operations, changes in members equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC (the Company) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Company is primarily engaged in the business of originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans through its retail origination channel. The Company maintains its corporate office in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with branch offices in multiple states. The Company is approved as a Title II, non-supervised direct endorsement mortgagee with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In addition, the Company is an approved issuer with the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), as well as an approved seller and servicer with the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Basis of Accounting The financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Consolidation, Variable Interest Entities The Company sells mortgage loans to FNMA and FHLMC, which are government-sponsored enterprises. The Company may also issue GNMA securities by pooling eligible mortgage loans through a custodian and assigning rights to the mortgage loans to GNMA. FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA (the Agencies) provide credit enhancements for mortgage loans through certain guarantee provisions. These securitizations involve variable interest entities (VIEs) as the trusts or similar vehicles, by design, that either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Consolidation, Variable Interest Entities (Continued) The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company may retain the right to service mortgage loans sold or securitized by the Agencies. Due to the significant influence of the Agencies over the VIEs that hold the assets from mortgage loan securitizations, principally through their rights and responsibilities as master servicer, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and therefore the VIEs are not consolidated. The Company performs on-going reassessments of (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore become subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company s involvement with a VIE cause the Company s consolidation determination to change. Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash flow purposes, the Company considers cash and temporary investments with original maturities of three months or less, to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company has diversified its credit risk for cash by maintaining deposits in several financial institutions, which may at times exceed amounts covered by insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of these financial institutions in determining the risk associated with these balances. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents. Restricted Cash The Company maintains certain cash balances that are restricted under warehouse agreements and broker margin accounts associated with its derivative instruments. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Revenue Recognition Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option with changes in fair value recorded in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statements of operations. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale committed to investors is calculated using observable market information such as the investor purchase commitment, assignment of trade or other mandatory delivery commitment prices. The Company bases loans committed to Agency investors based on the Agency s quoted mortgage backed security (MBS) prices. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors is based on quoted best execution secondary market prices. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, such as MBS prices, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan, which would be used by other market participants.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Revenue Recognition (Continued) Gains and losses from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale are recognized based upon the difference between the sales proceeds and carrying value of the related loans upon sale and are recorded in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statements of operations. Sales proceeds reflect the cash received from investors through the sale of the loan and servicing release premium. If the related mortgage servicing right (MSR) is sold servicing retained, the MSR addition is recorded in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statements of operations. Gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale also includes the unrealized gains and losses associated with the changes in the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and the realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments. Mortgage loans held for sale are considered sold when the Company surrenders control over the financial assets. Control is considered to have been surrendered when the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; the purchaser obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets. The Company typically considers the above criteria to have been met upon acceptance and receipt of sales proceeds from the purchaser. Mortgage Loans Held for Investment, Net Mortgage loans held for investment for which management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or to maturity are carried at amortized cost reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses. Mortgage loans transferred from the held for sale category are transferred at the lower of cost or fair value, which becomes the new cost basis in the loans. Loan Origination Fees Loan origination fees represent revenue earned from originating mortgage loans. Loan origination fees generally represent a flat per-loan fee amount based on a percentage of the original principal loan balance and are recognized as revenue at the time the mortgage loans are funded. Loan origination expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Interest Income Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized for the period from loan funding to sale based upon the principal balance outstanding and contractual interest rates. Revenue recognition is discontinued when loans become 90 days delinquent, or when, in management s opinion, the recovery of principal and interest becomes doubtful and the mortgage loans held for sale are put on nonaccrual status.

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Revenue Recognition FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) , establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The majority of the Company s revenue generating transactions are not subject to ASC 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as the Company s mortgage loans and derivatives, as well as revenue related to the Company s mortgage servicing activities. Loan Servicing Fees and Expenses Loan servicing fees represent revenue earned for servicing loans for various investors. Loan servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding unpaid principal balance and are recognized into revenue as the related mortgage payments are received. Loan servicing expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Servicing Advances Servicing advances represent escrows advanced by the Company on behalf of borrowers and investors to cover delinquent balances for property taxes, insurance premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. Servicing advances are made in accordance with the servicing agreements and are recoverable upon collection of future borrower payments, sale of loan collateral, reimbursement by investor, or mortgage insurance claims. The Company periodically reviews servicing advances for collectability and establishes a valuation allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts. No allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as management has determined that all amounts are fully collectible.

The Company periodically assesses property and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its fair value.

The Company did not recognize any impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Derivative Instruments The Company holds and issues derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and forward sale commitments. IRLCs are subject to price risk primarily related to fluctuations in market interest rates. To hedge the interest rate risk on mandatory IRLCs, the Company uses forward sale commitments, such as to-be-announced securities or mandatory delivery commitments with investors. Management expects these forward sale commitments to experience changes in fair value opposite to the changes in fair value of the IRLCs, thereby reducing earnings volatility. Forward sale commitments are also used to hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans held for sale that are not committed to investors and still subject to price risk. If the mandatory delivery commitments are not fulfilled, the Company pays a pair-off fee. Best effort forward sale commitments are also executed with investors, whereby certain loans are locked with a borrower and simultaneously committed to an investor at a fixed price. If the best effort IRLC does not fund, the Company has no obligation to fulfill the investor commitment. The Company considers various factors and strategies in determining what portion of the IRLCs and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale to economically hedge. FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheets at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and gains and losses resulting from pairing-out of forward sale commitments are recognized in gain on sale of mortgage loans held for sale on the statements of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company accounts for all derivative instruments as free-standing derivative instruments and does not designate any for hedge accounting. Mortgage Servicing Rights and Revenue Recognition FASB ASC 860-50, Transfers and Servicing , requires that MSRs be initially recorded at fair value at the time the underlying loans are sold. To determine the fair value of the MSR created, the Company uses a valuation model, along with currently available market information including rate sheets from aggregators, that calculates the net present value of future cash flows. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing revenue, including the estimated discount rate, estimated prepayment speeds, the cost of servicing, estimated delinquencies, contractual service fees, ancillary income and late fees, float value, the inflation rate, and default rates. The credit quality and stated interest rates of the forward loans underlying the MSRs affects the assumptions used in the cash flow models. MSRs are not actively traded in open markets; accordingly, considerable judgment is required to estimate their fair value, and changes in these estimates could materially change the estimated fair value. The Company receives a monthly fixed servicing fee based on the outstanding principal balances of the mortgage loans, which is collected from investors. 
 13 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Mortgage Servicing Rights and Revenue Recognition (Continued) After initially recording the MSRs at fair value, the Company subsequently amortizes the MSRs over the estimated economic life of the related mortgage loans in proportion to the estimated future net servicing revenue. The net capitalized cost of MSRs is periodically evaluated to determine if the amortized cost of MSRs is in excess of their estimated fair value. For this purpose, the Company stratifies its MSRs based on loan term, interest rate and product type, with estimates of remaining loan lives and prepayment rates being incorporated into the model. When impairment is identified due to the MSR asset s amortized book value exceeding its fair value, management records a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances are recorded as a reduction to the MSRs on the balance sheets. Any impairment of the amortized cost of MSRs is assessed based on their fair value at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans serviced and stratification based on risk characteristics of the underlying loans (predominantly interest rates). As interest rates decrease, mortgage refinancing activity may increase, resulting in higher prepayment speeds of the loans underlying MSRs, which may result in a reduction of the MSRs fair value. Such fair value adjustment may require an additional valuation allowance being charged to earnings, to the extent that the amortized cost of the MSR exceeds the estimated fair value from stratification. Conversely, as mortgage interest rates rise, prepayment speeds are usually slower and the value of the MSR asset generally increases, requiring less valuation allowance. If it is later determined that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a stratification, the valuation allowance is reduced through a recovery to earnings. An other-than-temporary impairment (i.e. recoverability is considered remote when considering interest rates and loan pay-off activity) is recognized as a write-down of the MSR asset and the related valuation allowance. A direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of the MSR asset and valuation allowance, precluding subsequent recoveries. The key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of MSRs when they are initially recorded were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2020: 

Inputs Discount rates 11.00 - 11.26 Annual prepayment speeds 15.39 - 21.40 Average cost of servicing 85 
 The Company s MSR portfolio was de minimus at December 31, 2019, therefore, certain disclosures pertaining to 2019 were omitted from the notes to the financial statements.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights A transfer of servicing rights related to loans previously sold qualifies as a sale at the date on which title passes, if substantially all risks and rewards of ownership have irrevocably passed to the transferee and any protection provisions retained by the transferor are minor and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, if a sale is recognized and only minor protection provisions exist, a liability should be accrued for the estimated obligation associated with those provisions. Loans in Forbearance and Eligible for Repurchase from GNMA When the Company has the unilateral right to repurchase GNMA pool loans it has previously sold (generally loans that are more than 90 days past due) and the Company has determined there is more than a trivial benefit to repurchase the loans, the Company records its right to the loan on its balance sheets as an asset and corresponding liability. The recognition of previously sold mortgage loans does not impact the accounting for the previously recognized MSRs. At December 31, 2020, delinquent or defaulted mortgage loans currently in GNMA pools that the Company has recognized on its balance sheets totaled 2,338,905. The Company had no delinquent or defaulted mortgage loans in GNMA pools at December 31, 2019. Loans with borrowers that have entered into a forbearance plan under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) have an unpaid principal balance of approximately 7,041,000 or 1.36 of the MSR portfolio at December 31, 2020, of which approximately 2,339,000 and 0.45 of the MSR portfolio is greater than 90 days delinquent. There were no actual repurchases of GNMA delinquent or defaulted mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company repurchased 503,131 of GNMA delinquent or defaulted mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2019 with the intention to modify their terms and include the loans in new GNMA pools. Real Estate Owned Real estate owned is initially recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of foreclosure of the underlying delinquent mortgage loan, which becomes the new cost basis in the real estate owned. The fair value of real estate owned is determined, when possible, using observable market data, including recent real estate appraisals and broker price opinions. Costs incurred in managing and maintaining foreclosed real estate and subsequent declines in fair value are charged to operations as incurred and are included in general and administrative on the statements of operations. The Company periodically assesses real estate owned for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may exceed their fair value. If real estate owned is considered impaired, the impairment losses will be recorded on the statements of operations.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Loan Indemnification Reserve Loans sold to investors by the Company and which met investor and Agency underwriting guidelines at the time of sale may be subject to repurchase in the event of specific default by the borrower or subsequent discovery that underwriting standards were not met. The Company may, upon mutual agreement, indemnify the investor against future losses on such loans. The Company has established a reserve for potential losses related to these representations and warranties. In assessing the adequacy of the reserve, management evaluates various factors including actual write-offs during the period, historical loss experience, known delinquent and other problem loans, and economic trends and conditions in the industry. Actual losses incurred are reflected as write-offs against the loan indemnification reserve. The activity in the loan indemnification reserve for mortgage loans held for sale is as follows for the years ended December 31: 

2020 2019 Balance, beginning of year 593,287 532,071 Recovery of loan losses 815,663 526,421 Reclassification of provision 100,000 Loans written-off, net of recoveries (183,882) (465,205) Balance, end of year 1,325,068 593,287 
 Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates underlying the loan indemnification reserve, there is a range of losses in excess of the recorded loan indemnification reserve that is reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss for representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss and is based on current available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Valuation Allowance on Mortgage Loans Held for Investment, Net The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of mortgage loans held for investment in excess of fair value and establishes a valuation allowance for potential losses. In assessing the adequacy of the valuation allowance, management evaluates various factors on a loan level basis, including the probability of not being able to collect payments based on the contractual terms of the mortgage, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and probable losses inherent to the loan portfolio. Additions to and recovery of the valuation allowance are reflected in the provision for loan losses on the statements of operations.

The estimate of the range of possible loss does not represent a probable loss and is based on current available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Escrow and Fiduciary Funds The Company maintains segregated bank accounts for escrow balances in trust for investors for mortgagors. The balances of these accounts amounted to 2,178,678 and 19,845 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are excluded from the balance sheets. Advertising and Marketing Advertising and marketing is expensed as incurred and amounted to 1,220,661 and 1,221,637 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in general and administrative on the statements of operations. Income Taxes The Company has elected to be taxed as a partnership under the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, no federal income tax provision and state income taxes, to the extent possible, have been recorded in the financial statements, as all items of income and expense generated by the Company are reported on the members income tax returns. The Company has no federal or state tax examinations in process as of December 31, 2020. Risks and Uncertainties In the normal course of business, companies in the mortgage banking industry encounter certain economic and regulatory risks. Economic risks include interest rate risk and credit risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that in a rising interest rate environment, the Company may experience a decrease in loan production, as well as decreases in the value of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors and commitments to originate loans, which may negatively impact the Company s operations. Credit risk is the risk of default that may result from the borrowers inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments during the period in which loans are being held for sale or serviced by the Company.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Risks and Uncertainties (Continued) The Company sells loans to investors without recourse. As such, the investors have assumed the risk of loss or default by the borrower. However, the Company is usually required by these investors to make certain standard representations and warranties relating to credit information, loan documentation and collateral. To the extent that the Company does not comply with such representations, or there are early payment defaults, the Company may be required to repurchase the loans or indemnify these investors for any losses from borrower defaults. In addition, if loans pay-off within a specified time frame, the Company may be required to refund a portion of the sales proceeds to the investors. The Company s business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities. As a result, the Company is dependent on its warehouse lines of credit, and other financing facilities in order to finance its continued operations. If the Company s principal lenders decided to terminate or not to renew any of these financing facilities with the Company, the loss of borrowing capacity could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements unless the Company found a suitable alternative source. The recent global outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted economic markets, and the prolonged economic impact is uncertain. The operational and financial performance of the Company depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, and such uncertainty may have an adverse impact on the Company s financial performance. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02), which requires recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all leases with a term greater than 12 months and to provide enhanced disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the FASB issued an ASU that further removes, modifies or adds certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The Company adopted the guidance beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , as amended, which amends the guidance for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost including receivables. The ASU requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach. Significantly all of the Company s financial assets are measured at fair value and are therefore not subject to the guidance; however, the Company determined that receivables and GNMA early buyout loans are within the scope of the ASU. GNMA early buyout loans are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which limits the Company s exposure to potential credit-related losses to an immaterial amount. Further, the estimated credit-related losses of the Company s receivables are also immaterial due to the short-term nature of the assets. Servicing advances are generally expected to be fully reimbursed under the terms of the servicing agreements. The Company adopted the guidance beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. B.

 The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of accounts receivable and advance balances with delinquent balances written-off based on specific credit evaluations and circumstances of the debtor. No allowance for doubtful accounts has been established at December 31, 2020 and 2019, as management has determined that all amounts are fully collectible. The Company issued two notes receivable to an employee totaling 218,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The notes receivable bear interest at 5.00 per annum with principal and unpaid interest payable on the fifth anniversary of each note receivable. The Company will forgive 20 of the principal and interest every 12 months after the effective date of each note receivable, provided the employee meets certain conditions related to continued employment and minimum annual loan origination. The notes receivable totaled 174,400 and 218,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in due from related parties on the balance sheets. E. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with borrowers who have applied for a loan and have met certain credit and underwriting criteria. The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from an independent third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate.

 (b) Pullthrough rate adjusted The notional amounts of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors amounted to approximately 105,819,000 and 17,514,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by its trading counterparties in derivative instruments that the Company uses in its rate risk management activities. The Company manages this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that the Company believes to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple counterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by entering into netting agreements with counterparties, as appropriate.

 F. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS The following summarizes the activity of MSRs for the years ended December 31: 2020 2019 Balance, beginning of year 6,750 303,194 Additions due to loans sold, servicing retained 1,856,167 15,094 Deletions due to sale of MSRs (259,948) Deletions due to loan payoffs (17,151) (19,787) Amortization expense (150,796) (31,803) Balance, end of year 1,694,970 6,750 
 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced approximated 517,842,000 and 4,476,000, respectively. Conforming conventional loans serviced by the Company are sold to FNMA and FHLMC on a non-recourse basis, whereby foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of FNMA and FHLMC, and not the Company. The government loans serviced by the Company are secured through GNMA, whereby the Company is insured against loss by the Federal Housing Administration or partially guaranteed against loss by the VA. The key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of the Company s MSRs are as follows at December 31, 2020: Inputs Discount rates 11.00 - 11.24 Annual prepayment speeds 15.52 - 21.40 Average cost of servicing 85 
 The hypothetical effect of an adverse change in these key unobservable inputs would result in a decrease in fair value as follows at December 31, 2020 : 

Amounts Discount rates: Effect on value - 1 adverse change (139,594) Effect on value - 2 adverse change (270,488) Prepayment speeds: Effect on value - 5 adverse change (153,468) Effect on value - 10 adverse change (299,990) Cost of servicing: Effect on value - 5 adverse change (28,738) Effect on value - 10 adverse change (57,477) 
 
 22 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 F. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (Continued) These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the table demonstrates, the Company s methodology for estimating the fair value of MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in key unobservable inputs. For example, actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on MSR fair value. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in inputs generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in input to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular input on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other input; in reality, changes in one factor may be associated with changes in another (for example, decreases in market interest rates may indicate higher prepayments; however, this may be partially offset by lower prepayments due to other factors such as a borrower s diminished opportunity to refinance), which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Thus, any measurement of MSR fair value is limited by the conditions existing and inputs made as of a particular point in time. Those inputs may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different point in time. Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold the majority of its MSR portfolio with an unpaid principal balance of approximately 75,280,000 for a net sales price of 597,813, which includes the gross sales prices of 629,063 less 31,250 for transactional expenses. The Company recognized a gain on sale of 337,865 which is recorded in gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights on the statements of operations. In addition, the Company recorded a receivable totaling 62,906, at December 31, 2019, related to the sale, which is due when all of the complete mortgage files have been received by the purchaser. The Company performed temporary sub-servicing activities with respect to the underlying loans through the established transfer date, for which the Company earned a fee and is also entitled to certain other ancillary income amounts.

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 O. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments to Extend Credit The Company enters into IRLCs with customers who have applied for residential mortgage loans and meet certain credit and underwriting criteria. These commitments expose the Company to market risk if interest rates change and the underlying loan is not economically hedged or committed to an investor. The Company is also exposed to credit loss if the loan is originated and not sold to an investor and the mortgagor does not perform. The collateral upon extension of credit typically consists of a first deed of trust in the mortgagor s residential property. Commitments to originate loans do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements as some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Total commitments to originate loans approximated 321,058,000 and 97,692,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Regulatory Contingencies The Company is subject to periodic audits and examinations, both formal and informal in nature, from various federal and state agencies, including those made as part of regulatory oversight of mortgage origination, servicing and financing activities. Such audits and examinations could result in additional actions, penalties or fines by state or federal governmental bodies, regulators or the courts. Operating Leases The Company leases office space and equipment under various operating lease arrangements, which expire through May 2025. Total rent expense under all operating leases amounted to 2,477,219 and 2,419,495 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in occupancy, equipment and communication on the statements of operations. Future minimum rental payments under long-term operating leases are as follows at December 31, 2020: 

Year Ending December 31, Amounts 2021 1,634,130 2022 941,993 2023 583,258 2024 408,689 2025 90,844 3,658,914

 O. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Legal The Company operates in a highly regulated industry and may be involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. The amount, if any, of ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, but despite the inherent uncertainties of litigation, management currently believes that the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings and exposure will not have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. However, actual outcomes may differ from those expected and could have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations or cash flows in a future period. The Company accrues for losses when they are probable to occur, and such losses are reasonably estimable. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative on the statements of operations. Regulatory Net Worth Requirements In accordance with the regulatory requirements of HUD, governing non-supervised, direct endorsement mortgagees, the Company is required to maintain a minimum net worth (as defined by HUD) of 2,500,000. At December 31, 2020, the Company exceeded the regulatory net worth requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements of GNMA, governing issuers of GNMA securities, the Company is required to maintain a minimum net worth (as defined by GNMA) of 4,808,820. At December 31, 2020, the Company exceeded the regulatory net worth requirement. Self-Insurance Plan The Company has engaged an insurance company to provided administrative services for the Company s self-funded insurance plan. The Company pays the qualifying medical claims expense for all participating individuals. The Company has a stop loss policy with the insurance company whereby they are reimbursed for all qualifying medical expenses incurred by individual employees above 1,665,736 in the aggregate. In addition, the Company is reimbursed for all aggregate medical expenses incurred by all participating individuals above 100,000 per the stop loss agreement. The Company has accrued for expenses related to incurred but not reported claims totaling 187,000 and 197,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. P. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not assumptions specific to the entity. 
 28 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 P. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon the market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). In accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Inputs Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs Inputs other than the quoted market prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Inputs Inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different methods or assumptions to estimate the fair value of certain financial statement items could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement may result in significantly different fair value measurements if any of those inputs were to change in isolation. Generally, a change in the assumptions used in the fair value measurement would be accompanied by a directionally opposite change in other assumptions. Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market for such items existed, or had such items been liquidated, and those differences could be material to the financial statements. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Mortgage loans held for sale (MLHFS) The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale based on Level 2 inputs is determined, when possible, using either quoted secondary-market prices or investor commitments. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan, which would be used by other market participants. Mortgage loans held for investment The fair value of mortgage loans held for investment is determined based on observable market information, including pricing from actual market transactions or broker quotations. 
 29 

 SOUTHERN TRUST MORTGAGE, LLC NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 P. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) Derivative instruments The fair value of IRLCs is based on valuation models incorporating market pricing for instruments with similar characteristics, commonly referred to as best execution pricing, or investor commitment prices for best effort IRLCs. The valuation models used to value the IRLCs have unobservable inputs, such as an estimate of the fair value of the servicing rights expected to be recorded upon sale of the loans, estimated costs to originate the loans, and pullthrough, and are therefore classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of forward sale commitments is based on observable market pricing for similar instruments and are therefore classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Mortgage servicing rights The fair value of MSRs is difficult to determine because MSRs are not actively traded in observable stand-alone markets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting net servicing cash flows discounted at a rate that management believes market participants would use in their determinations of fair value. The key unobservable inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include prepayment speeds, discount rates, default rates, cost to service, contractual servicing fees, escrow earnings and ancillary income. Real estate owned Real estate owned is initially recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of foreclosure on the delinquent mortgage loans, which becomes the new cost basis in the real estate owned. The fair value of real estate owned is determined, when possible, using observable market data, including recent real estate appraisals and broker price opinions. Subsequent declines in fair value are credited to a valuation allowance.
