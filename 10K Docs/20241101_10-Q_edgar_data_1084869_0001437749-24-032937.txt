Deferred Revenues 
 
 Deferred revenues are recorded when the Company has received consideration (i.e. advance payment) before satisfying its performance obligations. As such, customer orders are recorded as deferred revenue prior to shipment or rendering of product or services. Deferred revenues primarily relate to e-commerce orders placed, but not shipped, prior to the end of the fiscal period, as well as for subscription programs, including our various food, wine, and plant-of-the-month clubs and our Celebrations Passport program. 
 
 Our total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2024 was million (included in Accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets), of which million was recognized as revenue during the three months ended September 29, 2024 . The deferred revenue balance as of September 29, 2024 was million. 

million was primarily allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimates of their fair values on the acquisition date, including: property, plant and equipment of million, inventory of million and goodwill of million (deductible for income tax purposes), offset by net liabilities of million. The Company is in the process of finalizing its allocation and this may result in potential adjustments to the carrying value of the respective recorded assets and liabilities, establishment of certain additional intangible assets, revision of useful lives of intangible assets, and the determination of any residual amount that will be allocated to goodwill. 
 
 Scharffen Berger annual revenues and results of operations, based on its most recent available financial information, is deemed immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements, and, as such pro forma results of operations have not been presented. 

Acquisition of Card Isle 
 
 On April 3, 2024, the Company, within its BloomNet segment, completed its acquisition of certain assets of Card Isle , an e-commerce greeting card company, expanding the Company s presence in the greeting card category across all brands. The Company used cash on hand to fund the purchase. 
 
 The total consideration of million was primarily allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimates of their fair values on the acquisition date, including: goodwill of million (deductible for income tax purposes) and artist contracts of million 5 -year life). The Company is in the process of finalizing its allocation and this may result in potential adjustments to the carrying value of the respective recorded assets and liabilities, establishment of certain additional intangible assets, revisions of useful lives of intangible assets, and the determination of any residual amount that will be allocated to goodwill.

On June 27, 2023, the Company, certain of its U.S. subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Third Amended Credit Agreement ). The Third Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2019 as amended by the First Amendment, dated as of August 20, 2020, the Second Amendment, dated as of November 8, 2021, and the Third Amendment, dated as of August 29, 2022). The Third Amended Credit Agreement, among other modifications: (i) increased the amount of the outstanding term loan Term Loan to million, (ii) decreased the amount of the commitments in respect of the revolving credit facility to million, subject to a seasonal reduction to an aggregate amount of million for the period from January 1 to August 1, iii) extended the maturity date of the outstanding term loan and the revolving credit facilities to June 27, 2028, and (iv) increased the applicable interest rate margins for SOFR and base rate loans by basis points. 
 
 For each borrowing under the Third Amended Credit Agreement, the Company may elect that such borrowing bear interest at an annual rate equal to either: 1 a base rate plus an applicable margin varying based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio, where the base rate is the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the New York fed bank rate plus , and (c) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one month interest period plus or 2 an adjusted SOFR for rate plus an applicable margin varying based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio. The adjusted SOFR rate includes a credit spread adjustment of for all interest periods. 
 
 The Third Amended Credit Agreement requires that while any borrowings or commitments are outstanding the Company comply with certain financial covenants and affirmative covenants as well as certain negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments and make certain restricted payments. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 29, 2024 . The Third Amended Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. 
 
 The principal of the Term Loan is payable at a rate of million for the first 8 quarterly installments beginning on September 29, 2023, increasing to a quarterly payment of million, commencing on September 26, 2025, for the remaining 11 payments, with the remaining balance of million due upon maturity on June 27, 2028. 
 
 Future principal term loan payments under the Third Amended Credit Agreement are as follows: million remainder of Fiscal 2025 , million Fiscal 2026 , million Fiscal 2027 , and million Fiscal 2028 .

The following table presents by level, within the fair value hierarchy, financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Assets (Liabilities) as of June 30, 2024 
 Trading securities held in a rabbi trust (1) 

1 The Company has established a NQDC Plan for certain members of senior management. Deferred compensation plan assets are invested in mutual funds held in a rabbi trust, which is restricted for payment to participants of the NQDC Plan. Trading securities held in a rabbi trust are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included in the Other assets line item, with the corresponding liability included in the Other liabilities line item in the consolidated balance sheets. 

, compared to in the same period of the prior year. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible executive compensation including tax deficiencies (shortfalls) from stock-based compensation, partially offset by tax credits. 
 
 The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establishes valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. In completing this evaluation, the Company considers available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if permitted under the tax law, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, and expectations for future pre-tax operating income. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. As of September 29, 2024, and June 30, 2024, the Company had valuation allowances of approximately million, primarily related to certain state and foreign net operating losses. 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign countries. The Company s Fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 remain subject to U.S. federal examination. Due to nonconformity with the U.S. federal statute of limitations for assessment, certain states remain open from Fiscal 2020. The Company's foreign income tax filings from fiscal 2017 are open for examination by its respective foreign tax authorities, mainly Canada and Brazil. 
 
 The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. At September 29, 2024, the Company has an unrecognized tax benefit, including accrued interest and penalties, of approximately million (included in "Other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet), all of which if fully recognized would impact our effective tax rate. The Company believes that million of unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the next twelve months.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations. The following MD A discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 . The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company s plans, estimates and beliefs. The Company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed or referred to in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results, under Part I, Item 1A, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 under the heading Risk Factors and Part II-Other Information, Item 1A in this Form 10-Q.

 For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 . 
 
 Macro-economic Conditions 
 
 Overall, broader macro-economic conditions continue to impact our consumers as they continue to moderate their discretionary spending. Consumers remain pressured by persistent inflation and higher interest rates. Our fiscal first quarter contains no major holiday occasions, which means that our e-commerce sales for the quarter are primarily comprised of everyday or just-because gift giving. Based on this, we expected our sales to be the most challenged during the first quarter of Fiscal 2025. In line with our expectations, total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of Fiscal 2025 decreased 10.0 to 242.1 million, compared with total consolidated revenues of 269.1 million in the same prior year period. As we look ahead to the holiday period in the current environment, we expect our sales trends to improve as our gifting business has historically proven to be more resilient during holiday periods as consumers tend to view holiday gifting periods as being somewhat less discretionary.

 Company Guidance 
 
 For Fiscal 2025, the Company continues to expect its revenue trend to improve as the fiscal year progresses. The Adjusted EBITDA range reflects the acknowledgement that the consumer environment remains uncertain. 
 
 As a result, for Fiscal 2025 the Company continues to expect: 

Total revenues on a percentage basis to be in a range of flat to a decrease in the low single digits, as compared with the prior year; 

Adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of 85 million to 95 million; and 

Free Cash Flow to be in a range of 45 million to 55 million. 

Refer to "Definitions of non-GAAP Financial Measures" for reconciliation of non-GAAP results to applicable GAAP results. 
 
 Definitions of non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
 
 We sometimes use financial measures derived from consolidated financial information, but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Certain of these are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. See below for definitions and the reasons why we use these non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are referred to as non-GAAP , adjusted or "on a comparable basis" below, as these terms are used interchangeably. Reconciliations for forward-looking figures would require unreasonable efforts at this time because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of certain components of various necessary GAAP components, including, for example, those related to compensation, tax items, amortization or others that may arise during the year, and the Company's management believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The lack of such reconciling information should be considered when assessing the impact of such disclosures.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of stock-based compensation, Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan NQDC Plan Investment appreciation/depreciation, and certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. 
 
 The Company presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it considers such information meaningful supplemental measures of its performance and believes such information is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as factors to determine the total amount of incentive compensation available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to determine its interest rate and to measure compliance with certain covenants. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (a) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company's performance. 
 
 The following table presents the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

Adjusted net loss and adjusted or comparable net loss per common share 
 
 We define adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share as net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share adjusted for certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. We believe that adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share are meaningful measures because they increase the comparability of period-to-period results. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share, as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 
 
 The following table presents the adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per common share for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

Segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin 
 
 We define segment contribution margin as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, before the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Adjusted segment contribution margin is defined as contribution margin adjusted for certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. When viewed together with our GAAP results, we believe segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin provide management and users of the financial statements meaningful information about the performance of our business segments. 
 
 Segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin is that they are an incomplete measure of profitability as they do not include all operating expenses or non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for this limitation when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as operating income and net income. 
 
 The following table presents the net revenues, gross profit, segment contribution margin, and adjusted segment contribution margin from each of the Company s business segments, for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

(a) Segment performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or segment Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments, both of which are non-GAAP measurements. As such, management s measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead, described above, depreciation and amortization, other income (net), and other items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. 
 
 (b) Corporate expenses consist of the Company s enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, stock-based compensation, as well as changes in the fair value of the Company's NQDC Plan. In order to leverage the Company s infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment. 
 
 (c) See reconciliation of the Company's net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) above. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. The Company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of fixed assets, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the Company s business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet, and repurchase stock or retire debt. Free cash flow is a liquidity measure that is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. Since free cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period. 
 
 The following table reconciles net cash used in operating activities, a GAAP Measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP Measure for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

 Net revenues decreased 10.0 during the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year, due to lower order volume across the Company's three segments, reflecting a continuation of the trends that the Company had experienced throughout the prior fiscal year, as consumer discretionary income remains pressured, and consumers continue to moderate their spending. 
 
 The Company acquired Scharffen Berger and Card Isle on July 1, 2024 and April 3, 2024, respectively. Revenues related to these acquisitions were not significant during the three months ended September 29, 2024.

Revenue by sales channel: 
 
 E-commerce revenues (combined online and telephonic) decreased 8.0 during the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the decline in demand across our three segments, as a result of the macro-economic conditions noted above.

The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible executive compensation including tax deficiencies (shortfalls) from stock-based compensation, partially offset by tax credits. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity and borrowings 
 
 The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations, and borrowings available under the Company s credit agreement (see Note 7 - Debt, Net in Item 1 for details). At September 29, 2024, the Company had working capital of 118.7 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 8.4 million, compared to working capital of 157.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 159.4 million, at June 30, 2024. 
 
 Due to the seasonal nature of the Company s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company s second fiscal quarter, is expected to generate over 40 of the Company s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Mother s Day, Valentine s Day, Easter, and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also have historically risen during the Company s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, the Company had 45.0 million outstanding under its revolving credit agreement in order to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory procurement requirements. Working capital borrowings typically peak in November after which time cash generated from operations during the Christmas holiday shopping season is expected to enable the Company to repay such borrowings. 
 
 While we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We continually evaluate, and will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to require additional financing. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 177.2 million, for the three months ended September 29, 2024, was primarily attributable to the Company s net loss during the period, adjusted by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, combined with seasonal changes in net working capital, including increases in inventory, trade receivables, and prepaid and other current assets. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 15.1 million, for the three months ended September 29, 2024, was attributable to capital expenditures primarily related to the Company's technology and automation initiatives, and the acquisition of Scharffen Berger as noted above. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 41.3 million, for the three months ended September 29, 2024, related primarily to net proceeds from bank borrowings under the Company s working capital line of credit. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 Free cash flow was negative 189.3 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared with free cash flow of negative 150.8 million for three months ended October 1, 2023, a decrease of 38.5 million primarily driven by a decrease in cash flows from operations to fund the build in inventory for the holiday season. Refer to " Definitions of non-GAAP Financial Measures " for reconciliation of non-GAAP results to applicable GAAP results.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 As disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 , the discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company s most critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and income taxes. There have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to the Company s critical accounting policies since June 30, 2024. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1 - Accounting Policies in Item 1 for details regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued on our consolidated financial statements.

Forward Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results 
 
 Our disclosure and analysis in this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent the Company s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and can generally be identified by the use of statements that include words such as estimate, expects, project, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, foresee, forecast, likely, will, "should," goal, target or similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of the Company s control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including: 

the Company s ability: 

o 
 to achieve revenue and profitability; 

o 
 to leverage its operating platform and reduce operating expenses; 

o 
 to manage the seasonality of its business; 

o 
 to cost effectively acquire and retain customers; 

o 
 to successfully integrate acquired businesses and assets; 

o 
 to reduce working capital requirements and capital expenditures; 

o 
 to mitigate the impact of supply chain cost and capacity constraints; 

o 
 to compete against existing and new competitors; 

o 
 to manage expenses associated with sales and marketing and necessary general and administrative and technology investments; 

o 
 to address the effects of changes in accounting policies, practices, or assumptions, including changes that could potentially require future impairment charges; 

o 
 to achieve its guidance for the full Fiscal year; 

o 
 to successfully execute its strategic initiatives; and 

o 
 to reduce promotional activities and achieve more efficient marketing programs. 

the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings in the normal course of business; and 

general consumer sentiment and economic conditions that may affect, among other things, the levels of discretionary customer purchases of the Company s products and the costs of shipping and labor. 

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties, and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated, or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements. 
 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers can find them in Part I, Item 1A, of that filing under the heading Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . We incorporate that section of that Form 10-K in this filing and investors should refer to it. In addition, please refer to any additional risk factors in Part II, Item 1A in this Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from the effect of interest rate changes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company s investment of available cash balances and its long-term debt. The Company generally invests its cash and cash equivalents in investment grade corporate and U.S. government securities. Borrowings under the Company s credit facility bear interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, and therefore expose the Company to market risk for changes in interest rates. The effect of a 50 basis point increase in current interest rates on the Company s interest expense would be approximately 0.2 million during the three months ended September 29, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of September 29, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 29, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Company s evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, as specified above. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met.
