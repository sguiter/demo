 . We depreciate the leasehold improvements at our corporate office on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Depreciation expense relating to our corporate assets is included in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income. Determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and the assignment of depreciable lives requires management to exercise significant judgment. Project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition and development or redevelopment of a real estate project, for which we are the accounting owner, are capitalized as a cost of that project. Expenditures that meet one or more of the following criteria generally qualify for capitalization: the expenditure provides benefit in future periods; and the expenditure extends the useful life of the asset beyond our original estimates. 
 We define redevelopment properties as existing properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs that are not reimbursements to tenants for improvements at the properties. When existing properties are determined to be redevelopment properties, the net carrying value of the buildings and improvements are transferred to construction in progress while the redevelopment activities are in process. Costs capitalized to construction in progress related to redevelopment properties are transferred to buildings and improvements at historical cost of the properties as the redevelopment project or phases of projects are placed in service. impairment losses were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. million and million of security deposits for rent, respectively.

We also elected the short-term lease exception for lessees for leases that are less than 12 months. As lessee, we recognized a liability to account for our future obligations and a corresponding right-of-use asset related to our corporate office lease, which ends in January 2027 and contains annual escalations. We measured the lease liability based on the present value of the future lease payments (excluding the extension option that we are not reasonably certain to exercise), discounted using the estimated incremental borrowing rates of and , which were the interest rates that we estimated we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments at initial commencement in December 2019 and upon an amendment in November 2021, respectively. Subsequently, the lease liability is accreted by applying a discount rate established at the lease commencement date to the lease liability balance as of the beginning of the period and is reduced by the payments made during the period. The right-of-use asset is measured based on the corresponding lease liability. We did not incur any initial direct leasing costs or exchange any other consideration with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease. Subsequently, the right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis during the lease term. In each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized office lease expense of million and million, respectively, which is included in general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of income. In each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amounts paid and classified as operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the office lease were million. As lessor, for each of our real estate transactions involving the leaseback of the related property to the seller or affiliates of the seller, we determine whether these transactions qualify as sale and leaseback transactions under the accounting guidance. For these transactions, we consider various inputs and assumptions including, but not necessarily limited to, lease terms, renewal options, discount rates, and other rights and provisions in the purchase and sale agreement, lease and other documentation to determine whether control has been transferred to the Company or remains with the lessee. A transaction involving a sale leaseback will be treated as a purchase of a real estate property if it is considered to transfer control of the underlying asset from the lessee. A lease will be classified as direct-financing if risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control and will be classified as a sales-type lease if control of the underlying asset is transferred to the lessee. Otherwise, the lease is treated as an operating lease. These criteria also include estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the leased facilities, minimum lease payments, the economic useful

Lease Amendments In January 2024, we entered into lease amendments with subsidiaries of 4Front Ventures Corp. 4Front at the properties we lease to them in Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington, extending the term of each lease. The Illinois property, which is under development, has experienced significant delays in construction, primarily relating to completion of required utilities enhancements, which has resulted in an extended delay of the estimated completion of the project. As a result, we amended the Illinois lease to reduce base rent owing for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, defer the payback of the security deposit applicable to the lease (with the security deposit being subject to future pro-rata monthly payback), and increase the base rent for the remainder of the term commencing November 1, 2024. In February 2024, we amended our lease and development agreement with PharmaCann at of our New York properties, increasing the construction funding commitment by million, which also resulted in a corresponding adjustment to the base rent for the lease at the property.

In April 2024, we amended our lease with a subsidiary of Battle Green Holdings LLC at of our Ohio properties to provide an additional improvement allowance of million, which also resulted in a corresponding adjustment to the base rent for the lease at the property.

New Leases In January 2024, we executed a new lease with a tenant at of our retail properties in Michigan. In March 2024, we executed a new long-term lease with a subsidiary of Gold Flora Corporation Gold Flora at our property located at 63795 19th Avenue in Palm Springs, California (the 19 th Ave. Lease ). In April 2024, we executed a new long-term lease with Lume Cannabis Co. at our property located at 10070 Harvest Park in Dimondale, Michigan. In May 2024, we executed a new long-term lease with a subsidiary of Gold Flora at our property located at 19533 McLane Street in Palm Springs, California (the McLane Lease ). The commencement date under each of the 19 th Ave. Lease and McLane Lease is conditioned upon, among other things, the tenant s receipt of approvals to conduct cannabis operations by the requisite state and local authorities. Capitalized Costs During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we capitalized costs of million and funded million relating to improvements and construction activities at our properties. Property Dispositions In May 2024, we sold our leased property in Los Angeles, California for million (excluding closing costs) to a third-party buyer. Concurrently with the sale, pursuant to a separate agreement previously executed between us and the tenant, the tenant paid us a lease termination fee of million and paid for the closing and other costs incurred by us in connection with the sale of the property. In connection with this sale, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a disposition-contingent lease termination fee of million, which is included in rental revenue (including tenant reimbursements) on our condensed consolidated statements of income, and a loss on sale of real estate of million. In March 2023, we sold the portfolio of properties in California previously leased to affiliates of Medical Investor Holdings, LLC Vertical for million (excluding transaction costs) and provided a secured loan for million to the buyer of the properties. The loan matures on February 29, 2028 with options to extend the maturity for , conditional in each instance on the payment of an extension fee and at least million of the principal balance. The loan is interest only and payments are payable monthly in advance. The transaction did not qualify for recognition as a completed sale under GAAP since not all of the criteria were met. Accordingly, we have not derecognized the assets transferred on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. All consideration received, as well as any future payments, from the buyer will be recognized as a deposit liability and will be included in other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet until such time the criteria for recognition as a sale have been met. As of September 30, 2024, we have received interest payments of million. In addition, as we have not met all of the held-for-sale criteria, land and building and improvements with a gross carrying value of million and million, respectively, and accumulated depreciation of million as of September 30, 2024, remain on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, and the buildings and improvements continue to be depreciated.

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of a loan that does not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Construction Loan may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Construction Loan may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such loan and may differ materially from the value that the Company may ultimately realize.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this report that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, portfolio performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Likewise, our statements regarding anticipated growth in our funds from operations and anticipated market and regulatory conditions, our strategic direction, demographics, results of operations, plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise, and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, estimates or anticipates or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: rates of default on leases for our assets; concentration of our portfolio of assets and limited number of tenants; the estimated growth in and evolving market dynamics of the regulated cannabis market; the demand for regulated cannabis facilities; inflation dynamics; the impact of pandemics on us, our business, our tenants, or the economy generally; war and other hostilities, including the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel; our business and investment strategy; our projected operating results; actions and initiatives of the U.S. or state governments and changes to government policies and the execution and impact of these actions, initiatives and policies, including the fact that cannabis remains illegal under federal law; availability of suitable investment opportunities in the regulated cannabis industry; our understanding of our competition and our potential tenants alternative financing sources; the expected medical-use or adult-use cannabis legalization in certain states; shifts in public opinion regarding regulated cannabis; the potential impact on us from litigation matters, including rising liability and insurance costs; the additional risks that may be associated with certain of our tenants cultivating, processing and/or dispensing adult-use cannabis in our facilities; the state of the U.S. economy generally or in specific geographic areas; economic trends and economic recoveries; our ability to access equity or debt capital; financing rates for our target assets; our level of indebtedness, which could reduce funds available for other business purposes and reduce our operational flexibility; covenants in our debt instruments, which may limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition; our ability to maintain our investment grade credit rating; changes in the values of our assets; our expected portfolio of assets; our expected investments; interest rate mismatches between our assets and our borrowings used to fund such investments; changes in interest rates and the market value of our assets; the degree to which any interest rate or other hedging strategies may or may not protect us from interest rate volatility; the impact of and changes in governmental regulations, tax law and rates, accounting guidance and similar matters; how and when any forward equity sales may settle; our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our ability to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940; availability of qualified personnel; and market trends in our industry, interest rates, real estate values, the securities markets or the general economy. The risks included here are not exhaustive, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance, including factors and risks included in other sections of this report. In addition, we discussed a number of material risks in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Those risks continue to be relevant to our performance and financial condition. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only of the date on which we make it. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Stockholders and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in the Company s filings and reports. The purpose of this Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is to provide an understanding of the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

 Overview As used herein, the terms we , us , our or the Company refer to Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and any of our subsidiaries, including IIP Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership ). We are an internally-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of specialized properties leased to experienced, state-licensed operators for their regulated cannabis facilities. We have leased and expect to continue to lease our properties on a triple-net lease basis, where the tenant is responsible for all aspects of and costs related to the property and its operation during the lease term, including structural repairs, maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. We were incorporated in Maryland on June 15, 2016. We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT structure, in which our properties are owned by our Operating Partnership, directly or through subsidiaries. We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and own, directly or through subsidiaries, 100 of the limited partnership interests in our Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, we had 22 full-time employees. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 108 properties comprising 9.0 million square feet (including 618,000 rentable square feet under development/redevelopment) in 19 states. As of September 30, 2024, we had invested 2.4 billion in the aggregate (consisting of purchase price and funding of draws for construction funding and improvements submitted by tenants, if any, but excluding transaction costs) and had committed an additional 54.5 million to fund draws to certain tenants and vendors for improvements at our properties. Of the 54.5 million committed to fund draws to certain tenants and vendors for improvements at our properties, 9.2 million was incurred but not funded as of September 30, 2024. Of these 108 properties, we include 105 properties in our operating portfolio, which were 95.7 leased as of September 30, 2024, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 14.0 years. We do not include in our operating portfolio the following properties (all of which were under development/redevelopment as of September 30, 2024, and together are expected to comprise 491,000 rentable square feet upon completion of development/redevelopment): 63795 19th Avenue in Palm Springs, California (pre-leased); Inland Center Drive in San Bernardino, California; and Leah Avenue in San Marcos, Texas. Factors Impacting Our Operating Results Our results of operations are affected by a number of factors and depend on the rental revenues we receive from the properties that we acquire, the timing of lease expirations, general market conditions, the regulatory environment in the regulated cannabis industry, and the competitive environment for real estate assets that support the regulated cannabis industry. Rental Revenues We receive income primarily from rental revenues generated by the properties that we acquire. The amount of rental revenues depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to enter into leases with increasing or market value rents for the properties that we acquire; and rent collection, which primarily relates to each of our tenant s financial condition and ability to make rent payments to us on time. 
 The properties that we acquire consist of real estate assets that support the regulated cannabis industry. Most states where we own properties issue licenses for cannabis operations for a limited period. If one or more of our tenants are unable to renew or otherwise maintain their licenses or other state and local authorizations necessary to continue their cannabis operations, such tenants may default on their lease payments to us. Furthermore, changes in federal law and current favorable state or local laws in the cannabis industry may impair our ability to renew or re-lease properties and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease obligations and could materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates for our properties.

 Conditions in Our Markets Positive or negative changes in regulatory, economic or other conditions, drought, and natural disasters in the markets where we acquire properties may affect our overall financial performance. The success of our tenants in operating their businesses and their ability to pay rent continues to be significantly influenced by many challenges including the impact of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain constraints on their cost of doing business, and the U.S. consumer financial health. Additionally, market dynamics and the regulatory regime in the states where they operate create challenges that may impact our tenants businesses and/or decrease future demand for regulated cannabis cultivation and production facilities. The potential impact of current economic challenges on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is subject to change and continues to depend on the extent and duration of these risks and uncertainties. See Results of Operations Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Rental Revenues for more information. If these conditions persist or worsen, additional tenants may default on their obligations under our leases with them, and we may be unable to re-lease those properties on favorable terms or at all. Market Dynamics in Regulated Cannabis State Programs States vary significantly in their market dynamics, driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory frameworks, enforcement policies with respect to illicit, unlicensed cannabis operations, taxation and licensing structures. For example, in California, according to Global Go Analytics, t he illicit market for cannabis remains a much larger portion of overall sales in the state, and state and local authorities have assessed significant taxes on regulated cannabis products, both of which have had the impact of significantly limiting the growth and profitability for operators in the state s regulated cannabis market. Many states continue to experience significant declines in unit pricing for regulated cannabis products, with that decline more pronounced in certain states than in others, which compresses operating margins for operators. As a result, certain regulated cannabis operators have announced that they are consolidating operations or shuttering certain operations to reduce costs, which if prolonged, could have a material negative impact on operators demand for regulated cannabis facilities, including our existing tenants. Inflation and Supply Chain Constraints The U.S. economy has experienced a sustained increase in inflation rates in recent years, which we believe is negatively impacting our tenants. This inflation has impacted costs for labor and production inputs for regulated cannabis operators, in addition to increasing costs of construction for development and redevelopment projects. Ongoing labor shortages and global supply chain issues also continue to adversely impact costs and timing for completion of these development and redevelopment projects, which are resulting in cost overruns and delays in commencing operations on certain of our tenants projects. Reduced Capital Availability for Tenants and the Company In recent years, financial markets have been volatile, reflecting heightened geopolitical risks and material tightening of financial conditions, which have contributed to significant declines in capital availability for regulated cannabis operators. As regulated cannabis operators also face significant debt maturities in the next few years, certain operators are expected to face challenges in refinancing or extending those debt maturities. Capital raising activities by U.S. REITs have also experienced steep declines, including significantly reduced capital availability for our company. Significant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk As of September 30, 2024, we owned 108 properties located in 19 states leased to 30 tenants (not including three non-cannabis tenants in two properties). Many of our tenants are tenants at multiple properties. We seek to manage our portfolio-level risk through geographic diversification and by minimizing dependence on any single property or tenant. At September 30, 2024, our largest property was located in New York and accounted for 5.5 of our net real estate held for investment. No other properties accounted for more than 5 of our net real estate held for investment at September 30, 2024. See Note 2 Concentration of Credit Risk in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the tenants in our portfolio that represented the largest percentage of our total rental revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Competitive Environment We face competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including but not limited to, other companies with similar business models, independent investors, hedge funds, lenders and other real estate investors, as well as potential tenants (cannabis operators themselves), all of whom may compete with us in our efforts to acquire real estate zoned for regulated cannabis operations. Competition from others may diminish our opportunities to acquire a desired property on favorable terms or at all. In addition, this competition may put pressure on us to reduce the rental rates below those that we expect to charge for the properties that we acquire, which would adversely affect our financial results. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include general and administrative expenses, including personnel costs, stock-based compensation, and legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, public reporting and compliance with the various provisions of U.S. securities laws. Our operating expenses also include costs that we incur for properties that are not leased (or are leased but tenant s rent obligations, including for payment of operating expenses, have not yet commenced), including taxes, insurance, maintenance, security, utilities and other property-specific costs. We generally structure our leases so that the tenant is responsible for taxes, maintenance, insurance and structural repairs with respect to the premises throughout the lease term. Increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall financial performance. Our Qualification as a REIT We have been organized and operate our business so as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shares of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are subject to restrictions on ownership and transfer that are intended, among other purposes, to assist us in qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT. In order for us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), the relevant sections of our charter provide that, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may own, or be deemed to own, by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8 (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock or Series A Preferred Stock or more than 9.8 (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or any class or series of our outstanding preferred stock.

 Results of Operations Investments in Real Estate See Note 6 Investment in Real Estate in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding our investments in real estate activity and property portfolio activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table sets forth the results of our operations (in thousands): 

For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues: Rental (including tenant reimbursements) 76,052 77,286 230,219 228,734 Other 474 540 1,554 1,616 Total revenues 76,526 77,826 231,773 230,350 Expenses: Property expenses 7,295 6,318 20,867 17,700 General and administrative expense 9,330 10,981 28,553 31,924 Depreciation and amortization expense 17,944 16,678 52,567 50,096 Total expenses 34,569 33,977 101,987 99,720 Gain (loss) on sale of real estate (3,449) Income from operations 41,957 43,849 126,337 130,630 Interest income 2,685 2,075 8,435 6,625 Interest expense (4,427) (4,330) (13,136) (13,322) Gain (loss) on exchange of Exchangeable Senior Notes 22 Net income 40,215 41,594 121,636 123,955 Preferred stock dividends (564) (338) (1,240) (1,014) Net income attributable to common stockholders 39,651 41,256 120,396 122,941 Rental Revenues. Rental revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 declined by 1.2 million, or 2 to 76.1 million, compared to 77.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was primarily driven by a 3.0 million decline in contractual rent and property management fees received during the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to properties that we regained possession of or sold since June 2023; a decline of 1.3 million due to rent received but not recognized in rental revenues resulting from the re-classifications of two sales-type leases starting January 1, 2024 (see Note 2 Lease Accounting to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information); and 1.3 million of contractually due rent and property management fees that were not collected during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This decline was partially offset by a 4.6 million increase to contractual rent and property management fees, which was primarily driven by contractual rent escalations, amendments to leases for additional improvement allowances at existing properties that resulted in adjustments to rent, and new leases entered into since June 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we applied 1.4 million of security deposits for payment of rent on properties leased to 4Front Ventures Corp. 4Front (four properties), TILT Holdings Inc. TILT (one property), and Emerald Growth Holdings LLC Emerald Growth (one property). We terminated our lease with Temescal Wellness of Massachusetts, LLC at our Massachusetts property and regained possession of the property on September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we applied 2.2 million of security deposits for payment of rent. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we applied 0.9 million in security deposits for the properties leased to 4Front, TILT and Emerald Growth for the payment of rent owing in October 2024, and, including those security deposits applied, we collected 1.4 million of the contractually due rent and interest of 2.2 million for the month of October 2024 for 4Front, Emerald Growth, TILT and a secured loan for which we are the lender for a California property portfolio. Rental revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.5 million, or 1 , to 230.2 million, compared to 228.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 15.8 million increase to contractual rent and property management fees due to contractual rent escalations, amendments to leases for additional improvement

 allowances at existing properties that resulted in adjustments to rent, and new leases entered into since December 2022; and a 3.9 million disposition-contingent lease termination fee that was received in connection with the sale of our property in Los Angeles, California. The increase was partially offset by a 12.8 million decline in contractual rent and property management fees received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to properties that we regained possession of since December 2022; a decline of 3.9 million due to rent received but not recognized in rental revenues resulting from the re-classifications of two sales-type leases starting January 1, 2024 (see Note 2 Lease Accounting to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information); and 1.6 million of contractually due rent and property management fees that were not collected. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we applied 2.0 million and 8.0 million of security deposits for payment of rent, respectively. While we have re-leased several properties that we regained possession of since March 2023, rent commencement on certain of these properties is contingent on the tenants obtaining the requisite approvals to operate. We have also granted temporary rent abatements in certain instances as tenants transition into the properties and commence operations. As a result, we do not expect to recognize rental revenue from those properties until such events have occurred. Other Revenues. Other revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of interest revenue related to leases for property acquisitions that did not satisfy the requirements for sale-leaseback accounting. Property Expenses. Property expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.0 million to 7.3 million, compared to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Property expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.2 million to 20.9 million, compared to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily due to additional investment in existing properties, which resulted in higher property tax that we paid for our properties, as well as higher property expenses related to properties that we have regained possession of but not yet leased. Property expenses related to leased properties are generally reimbursable to us by the tenants under the terms of the leases. General and Administrative Expense . General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.7 million to 9.3 million, compared to 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3.3 million to 28.6 million, compared to 31.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expense for each period was primarily due to lower litigation-related expense incurred and lower compensation to employees compared to the prior year periods. The lower compensation was primarily due to the expiration of the PSUs granted in 2021 on December 31, 2023 (which were forfeited in their entirety as they failed to meet the threshold for any payout as of that date), which was partially offset by increases to payroll salary, bonus expense and non-PSU related stock-based compensation for employees and directors. Compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 4.3 million and 13.0 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. Compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 4.9 million and 14.6 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million to 17.9 million, compared to 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.5 million to 52.6 million, compared to 50.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to depreciation for properties that we acquired in 2023, one property we acquired in June 2024 and the placement into service of construction and improvements at certain of our properties. Loss on Sale of Real Estate. Amount relates to the sale of property in Los Angeles, California in May 2024 (see Note 6 Investments in Real Estate to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information). Interest Income. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.6 million to 2.7 million, compared to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.8 million to 8.4 million, compared to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily due to cash interest received on our construction loan pursuant to which we agreed to lend up to 23.0 million, for the development of a regulated cannabis cultivation and processing facility in California (the Construction Loan ). Cash interest received on our Construction Loan was 1.1 million and 3.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus 0.4 million and 1.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash interest received on our Construction Loan included a loan maturity extension fee paid to us of 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Interest Expense. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our Notes due 2026. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.1 million to 4.4 million, compared to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to non-cash interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.2 million to 13.1 million, compared to 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to higher capitalization of interest and the maturity of the Exchangeable Senior Notes in February 2024. Cash Flows Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 200,640 189,462 11,178 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (52,431) (5,999) (46,432) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (142,780) (153,551) 10,771 Ending cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 147,128 118,484 28,644 Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 200.6 million and 189.5 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities were generally from contractual rent and tenant reimbursements from our properties, partially offset by our general and administrative expense, interest expense, property expenses in excess of tenant reimbursements and property expenses at properties that were not leased. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the 3.9 million disposition-contingent lease termination fee that was received concurrently with the sale of our property in Los Angeles, California, higher contractual rent collection (including deferred lease payments received on sales-type leases), proceeds from property insurance claims, higher interest income and changes in working capital due to timing of vendor payments. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 52.4 million, of which 58.7 million was related to investments in real estate and funding of draws for improvement and construction funding at our properties, 2.8 million was related to net purchases and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by 9.1 million in proceeds related to the sale of our Los Angeles, California property. Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 6.0 million, of which 167.9 million was related to investments in real estate and funding of draws for improvement and construction funding at our properties and other investments, partially offset by 161.9 million related to net purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of 142.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of dividend payments of 158.7 million to common and preferred stockholders, principal payment on the Exchangeable Senior Notes of 4.4 million, and 1.1 million related to net share settlement of equity awards to pay the required withholding taxes upon vesting of restricted stock for certain employees and payment of deferred financing costs, partially offset by 11.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and 9.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to our ATM Program. Net cash used in financing activities of 153.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of dividend payments of 153.0 million to common and preferred stockholders and 0.6 million related to net share settlement of equity awards to pay the required withholding taxes upon vesting of restricted stock for certain employees.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements. We derive substantially all of our revenues from the leasing of our properties and collecting rental income, which includes operating expense reimbursements, based on contractual arrangements with our tenants. This source of revenue represents our primary source of liquidity to fund the acquisition of additional properties, the development and redevelopment of existing properties, dividends to our stockholders, obligations under our Notes due 2026, repayment of borrowings and interest payments under our Revolving Credit Facility, general and administrative expenses, property development and redevelopment activities, property operating expenses and other expenses incurred related to managing our existing portfolio and investing in additional properties. Because substantially all of our leases are triple net, our tenants are generally responsible for the maintenance, insurance and property taxes associated with the properties they lease from us. If a tenant defaults on one of our leases or the lease term expires with no tenant renewal, we would incur property costs not paid by the tenant during the time it takes to re-lease or sell the property. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 108 properties. Of these properties, the 105 properties in our operating portfolio were 95.7 leased, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 14.0 years. We expect to incur some property-level operating costs from time to time in periods during which properties that become vacant are being remarketed or re-positioned. In addition, we may recognize an expense for certain property costs, such as insurance premiums and real estate taxes billed in arrears, if we believe the tenant is likely to vacate the property before making payment on those obligations or may be unable to pay such costs in a timely manner. Property costs are generally not significant to our operations, but the amount of property costs can vary quarter to quarter based on the number of property vacancies and whether we have any underperforming properties. We may advance certain property costs on behalf of our tenants but expect that the majority of these costs will be reimbursed by the tenant and do not anticipate that they will be significant to our operations. In addition, for properties that are not leased and are under development or redevelopment, we may make significant additional investments in these properties in order to get them ready for their intended use and to re-lease them. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, property expenses included 0.9 million and 2.6 million, respectively, of non-reimbursed expenses related to operating properties that were not leased. To the extent additional resources are needed, we expect to fund our investment activity generally through equity or debt issuances either in the public or private markets along with draws on our Revolving Credit Facility. Where possible, we also may issue limited partnership interests in our Operating Partnership to acquire properties from existing owners seeking a tax-deferred transaction. In May 2021, we received an investment grade rating from a ratings agency. We sought to obtain an investment grade rating to facilitate access to the investment grade unsecured debt market as part of our overall strategy to maximize our financial flexibility and manage our overall cost of capital. In May 2021, our Operating Partnership issued 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes due 2026. The Notes due 2026 are the Operating Partnership s general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us, and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Operating Partnership s future senior unsecured indebtedness. The terms of the Notes due 2026 are governed by an indenture, which requires compliance with various financial covenants including limits on the amount of total leverage and secured debt maintained by the Operating Partnership and which require the Operating Partnership to maintain minimum levels of debt service coverage. Management believes that it was in compliance with those covenants as of September 30, 2024. In addition, the terms of the indenture provide that if the debt rating on the Notes due 2026 is downgraded or withdrawn entirely, interest on the Notes due 2026 will increase to a range of 6.0 to 6.5 based on such debt rating. In February 2024, we issued 28,408 shares of our common stock and paid 4.3 million in cash upon exchange by holders of 4.3 million principal amount of Exchangeable Senior Notes and paid off the remaining 0.1 million principal amount, in accordance with terms of the indenture for the Exchangeable Senior Notes. In May 2024, we terminated the previously existing at-the-market offering program (the Prior ATM Program and entered into new equity distribution agreements with four sales agents, pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time through an at-the-market offering program (the ATM Program ), including on a forward basis, shares of our common stock and 9.00 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock , up to an aggregate offering price of 500.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 123,224 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Prior ATM Program for net proceeds of 11.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 402,673 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the ATM Program for net proceeds of 9.6 million.

 We have filed an automatic shelf registration statement, which may permit us, from time to time, to offer and sell common stock, preferred stock, debt, warrants and other securities to the extent necessary or advisable to meet our liquidity needs. In October 2023, our Operating Partnership entered into a loan and security agreement (the Loan Agreement with a federally regulated commercial bank, as lender and as agent for lenders that become party thereto from time to time. The Loan Agreement matures on October 23, 2026, and was most recently amended in November 2024 to increase aggregate commitments for secured revolving loans to 87.5 million (the Revolving Credit Facility . The Loan Agreement also allows the Operating Partnership, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request additional revolving incremental loan commitments up to a specified amount. The Loan Agreement is subject to certain liquidity and operating covenants and includes customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. There were no amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024. In May 2024, we sold a property in Los Angeles, California for 9.1 million (excluding closing costs), received a disposition-contingent lease termination fee from the tenant concurrently with the closing of 3.9 million and received tenant reimbursement of our closing and other costs related to the sale of the property. We expect to meet our liquidity needs through cash and investments on hand, cash flows from operations, draws on our Revolving Credit Facility and cash flow from sources discussed above. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy our cash requirements. We cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the Company in sufficient amounts to meet our liquidity needs. Our investment guidelines also provide that our aggregate borrowings (secured and unsecured) will not exceed 50 of the cost of our tangible assets at the time of any new borrowing, subject to our board of directors discretion. In the long term, we may also voluntarily repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. In recent years, financial markets have been volatile in general. If sustained, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to continue to make acquisitions of new properties and fund investments for improvements at existing properties, and refinance our existing indebtedness. Dividends The Company is required to pay dividends to its stockholders at least equal to 90 of its taxable income in order to qualify and maintain its qualification as a REIT. As a result of this distribution requirement, our Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. Our ability to continue to pay dividends is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash flows, service any debt obligations we have, including our Notes due 2026, and make accretive new investments. The following table describes the dividends declared by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 

Amount Declaration Per Dividend Date Security Class Share Period Covered Paid Date Dividend Amount (In thousands) March 15, 2024 Common stock 1.82 January 1, 2024 to March 31, 2024 April 15, 2024 51,957 March 15, 2024 Series A preferred stock 0.5625 January 15, 2024 to April 14, 2024 April 15, 2024 338 June 14, 2024 Common stock 1.90 April 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024 July 15, 2024 54,253 June 14, 2024 Series A preferred stock 0.5625 April 15, 2024 to July 14, 2024 July 15, 2024 338 September 13, 2024 Common stock 1.90 July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 October 15, 2024 54,253 September 13, 2024 Series A preferred stock 0.5625 July 15, 2024 to October 14, 2024 October 15, 2024 564

 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 

Payments Due by Year Notes due 2026 Interest Office Rent Total 2024 (three months ended December 31) 4,125 128 4,253 2025 16,500 526 17,026 2026 300,000 6,646 543 307,189 2027 45 45 2028 Total 300,000 27,271 1,242 328,513 Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had (1) 44.2 million outstanding in commitments related to improvement allowances, which generally may be requested by the tenants at any time up until a date that is near the expiration of the initial term of the applicable lease; (2) 1.1 million outstanding in commitments related to contracts with vendors for improvements at our properties, which are expected to be incurred by December 31, 2024; and (3) 1.0 million outstanding in commitments to fund the Construction Loan. The commitments discussed in this paragraph are excluded from the table of contractual obligations above, as improvement allowances generally may be requested by the tenants at any time up until a date that is near the expiration of the initial term of the applicable lease, there is no explicit time frame for incurring the obligations related to our contracts with vendors, and Construction Loan funding generally may be requested by the borrower from time to time, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Supplemental Guarantor Information Our Notes due 2026 are the unsecured senior obligations of our Operating Partnership and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by us. The Notes due 2026 and the related guarantee are registered securities under the Securities Act. See Note 7 Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of certain terms of our Notes due 2026. As a result of the amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company s consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is full and unconditional and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of our Operating Partnership have not been presented. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership because the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Operating Partnership are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors. Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to the required GAAP presentations, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public and thus such reported measures could change. Funds from Operations, Normalized Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations Funds from operations FFO and FFO per share are operating performance measures adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a REIT s operating performance equal to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, depreciation, amortization and impairment related to real estate properties, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company also excludes the disposition-contingent lease termination fee relating to the sale of our property in Los Angeles, California in May 2024. Management believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, management believes FFO and FFO per share to be supplemental measures of a REIT s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to certain significant non-cash items, primarily

 depreciation expense. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. We believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, FFO and FFO per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods. We report FFO and FFO per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by industry analysts to evaluate REITs and because FFO per share is consistently reported, discussed, and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about REITs. For these reasons, management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss FFO and FFO per share. We compute normalized funds from operations Normalized FFO by adjusting FFO, as defined by NAREIT, to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that we believe are infrequent and unusual in nature and/or not related to our core real estate operations. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the equity REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO per share provides investors with a metric to assist in their evaluation of our operating performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of other companies, because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact our operating performance on an ongoing basis. Normalized FFO is used by management in evaluating the performance of our core business operations. Items included in calculating FFO that may be excluded in calculating Normalized FFO include certain transaction-related gains, losses, income or expense or other non-core amounts as they occur. Management believes that adjusted funds from operations AFFO and AFFO per share are also appropriate supplemental measures of a REIT s operating performance. We calculate AFFO by adjusting Normalized FFO for certain cash and non-cash items. For all periods presented other than the three months ended September 30, 2024, FFO (diluted), Normalized FFO and AFFO, and FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO per diluted share include the dilutive impact of the assumed full exchange of the Exchangeable Senior Notes for shares of common stock as if the Exchangeable Senior Notes were exchanged at the beginning of the respective reporting period. The Exchangeable Senior Notes matured in February 2024. Performance share units PSUs granted to certain employees were included in dilutive securities to the extent the performance thresholds for vesting of the PSUs were met as measured as of the end of each respective period. Our computation of FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such REITs. Further, FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flow available for management s discretionary use. FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of operations.

 (1) Amount reflects the 3.9 million disposition-contingent lease termination fee received concurrently with the sale of our property in Los Angeles, California, net of the loss on sale of real estate of 3.4 million (see Note 6 Investments in Real Estate to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information). (2) Amount reflects the non-refundable interest received on the seller-financed note issued to us by the buyer in connection with our disposition of a portfolio of four properties in southern California previously leased to affiliates of Vertical, which is recognized as a deposit liability and is included in other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, as the transaction did not qualify for recognition as a completed sale. (3) Amount reflects the non-refundable lease payments received on two sales-type leases which are recognized as a deposit liability starting on January 1, 2024, and is included in other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, as the transaction did not qualify for recognition as a completed sale (see Note 2 Lease Accounting to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information). Prior to the lease modifications on January 1, 2024, which extended the initial lease terms, the leases were classified as operating leases and the lease payments received were recognized as rental revenue and therefore, included in net income attributable to common stockholders. Critical Accounting Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate the estimates and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with GAAP, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The following critical accounting estimates discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. This discussion of our critical accounting estimates is intended to supplement the description of our accounting policies in the footnotes to our condensed consolidated financial statements and to provide additional insight into the information used by management when evaluating significant estimates and assumptions. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements in

 our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. Lease Accounting We account for our leases under Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases, which requires significant estimates and judgments by management in its application. Upon lease inception or lease modification, we assess the lease classification of both the land and building components of the property. The determination of lease classification requires the calculation of the rate implicit in the lease, which is driven by significant estimates relating to the unguaranteed residual value of the assets at the end of the non-cancelable lease term. A decrease of 5 in the estimated unguaranteed residual value of our properties would result in changes to the lease classification of one lease that was modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Acquisition of Rental Property, Depreciation and Impairment All of our acquisitions of rental properties to date were accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business combinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. We exercise judgment to determine key assumptions used in each valuation technique (cost, income, and sales approach). For example, we are required to use judgment and make a number of assumptions, including those related to projected growth in rental rates and operating expenses, anticipated trends and market/economic conditions. The use of different assumptions can affect the amount of consideration allocated to the acquired depreciable/amortizable asset, which in turn can impact our net income due to the recognition of the related depreciation/amortization expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We depreciate buildings and improvements where we are considered the owner for accounting purposes based on our evaluation of the estimated useful life of each specific asset, not to exceed 40 years. Determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and the assignment of depreciable lives requires management to exercise significant judgment. The determination of whether we are or the tenant is the owner of improvements for accounting purposes is subject to significant judgment. In making that determination, we consider numerous factors and perform a detailed evaluation of each individual lease. No one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion. The factors we evaluate include but are not limited to the following: whether the lease agreement requires landlord approval of how the improvement allowance is spent prior to installation of the improvements; whether the lease agreement requires the tenant to provide evidence to the landlord supporting the cost and what the improvement allowance was spent on prior to payment by the landlord for such improvements; whether the improvements are unique to the tenant or reusable by other tenants; whether the tenant is permitted to alter or remove the improvements without the consent of the landlord or without compensating the landlord for any lost utility or diminution in fair value; and whether the ownership of the improvements remains with the landlord or remains with the tenant at the end of the lease term. When we conclude that we are the owner of improvements for accounting purposes using the factors discussed above, we record the cost to construct the improvements as our capital asset. We evaluate our real estate assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a given asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate our real estate assets for impairment on a property-by-property basis. Indicators we use to determine whether an impairment evaluation is necessary include: deterioration in rental rates for a specific property; deterioration of a given rental submarket; significant change in strategy or use of a specific property or any other event that could result in a decreased holding period, including classifying a property as held for sale, or significant development delay; evidence of material physical damage to the property; and default by a significant tenant when any of the other indicators above are present.

 When we evaluate for potential impairment our real estate assets to be held and used, we first evaluate whether there are any indicators of impairment. If any impairment indicators are present for a specific real estate asset, we then perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis and compare the net carrying amount of the real estate asset to the real estate asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flow over the anticipated holding period. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flow is less than the net carrying amount of the real estate asset, we perform an impairment loss calculation to determine if the fair value of the real estate asset is less than the net carrying value of the real estate asset. Our impairment loss calculation compares the net carrying amount of the real estate asset to the real estate asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated discounted future cash flow calculations or third-party valuations or appraisals. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s net carrying amount exceeds the asset s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the estimated fair value of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis would be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. If a real estate asset is designated as real estate held for sale, it is carried at the lower of the net carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation ceases. Our undiscounted cash flow and fair value calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and property fair values, including determining our estimated holding period. We are also required to make a number of assumptions relating to future economic and market events and prospective operating trends. For each property where such an indicator occurred, we completed an impairment evaluation. After completing this process, we determined that for each of the operating properties evaluated, undiscounted cash flows over the holding period were in excess of carrying value and, therefore, we did not record any impairment losses for these properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Significant adverse changes in the critical accounting estimates used in the impairment evaluation are required for the undiscounted cash flows over the holding period to be less than the carrying value as of September 30, 2024. Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. In recent years, the commercial real estate market generally has experienced significant disruptions from, among other things, significant increases in interest rates and changing tenant preferences for space. Interest Rate Risk As of September 30, 2024, we had 300.0 million principal amount of Notes due 2026 outstanding at a fixed interest rate of 5.50 , and therefore, if interest rates decline, our required payments may exceed those based on current market rates. It is possible that a property we acquire in the future would be subject to a mortgage, which we may assume. In recent years, the commercial real estate market generally has experienced significant disruptions from, among other things, significant increases in interest rates and changing tenant preferences for space. Our Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the greater of the prime rate and an applicable margin and a stipulated interest rate; therefore, if interest rates increase, our required payments on any amounts outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility may also increase. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. Impact of Inflation The U.S. economy has experienced a period of increased inflation in recent years. We enter into leases that generally provide for fixed increases in rent. During times when inflation is greater than the fixed increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Seasonality Our business has not been, and we do not expect our business in the future to be, subject to material seasonal fluctuations. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Notes due 2026 bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50 per annum until maturity and is the only debt we have outstanding. Our Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the greater of the prime rate and an applicable margin and a stipulated interest rate; therefore, if interest rates increase, our required payments on any amounts outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility may also increase.

 Our investments in short-term money market funds, certificates of deposit and short-term investments in obligations of the U.S. government with an original maturity at the time of purchase of greater than 90 days are less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of long-term securities. Accordingly, we believe that a significant change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has evaluated, under supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report). Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation to our condensed consolidated financial statements, which is hereby incorporated by reference. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Except to the extent additional factual information disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates to such risk factors, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The risks as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS (a) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 28,408 shares of our common stock upon exchange by holders of 4.3 million of outstanding principal amount of our Exchangeable Senior Notes. Such shares of our common stock were issued in reliance on Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

(B) No Person shall Beneficially or Constructively Own Shares to the extent that such Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of Shares would result in the Company being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, Beneficial or Constructive Ownership that would result in the Company owning (actually or Constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the Company from such tenant would cause the Company to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code). (C) No Person shall Transfer any Shares if, as a result of the Transfer, the Shares would be Beneficially Owned by less than 100 Persons (determined without reference to the rules of attribution under Section 544 of the Code). Notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein (but subject to Section 5.8), any Transfer of Shares that, if effective, would result in Shares being Beneficially Owned by less than 100 Persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio , and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares. 
 7 

 (II) TRANSFER IN TRUST . If any Transfer of Shares occurs which, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning or Constructively Owning Shares in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B), (A) then that number of Shares the Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) (rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 5.7(iii), effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer, and such Person shall acquire no rights in such Shares; or (B) if the transfer to the Trust described in clause (A) of this sentence would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) then the Transfer of that number of Shares that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) shall be void ab initio , and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares. (III) To the extent that, upon a transfer of Shares pursuant to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II), a violation of any provision of this Section 5.7 would nonetheless be continuing (for example, where the ownership of Shares by a single Trust would violate the 100 stockholder requirement applicable to REITs), then Shares shall be transferred to the number of Trusts, each having a distinct Trustee and one or more Charitable Beneficiaries that are distinct from those of each other Trust, such that there is not violation of any provisions of this Section 5.7. (b) REMEDIES FOR BREACH . If the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof shall at any time determine in good faith that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of any Shares in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board or a committee thereof shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Company to redeem Shares, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or other event; provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) shall automatically result in the transfer to the Trust described above, and, where applicable, such Transfer (or other event) shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board or a committee thereof. (c) NOTICE OF RESTRICTED TRANSFER . Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares that will or may violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) or any Person who would have owned Shares that resulted in a transfer to the Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II) shall immediately give written notice to the Company of such event, or in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice, and shall provide to the Company such other information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer on the Company s status as a REIT.

(II) Prior to granting any exception pursuant to Section 5.7(ii)(g)(I), the Board may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board in its sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Company s status as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting such exception.

(c) Except as provided in Section 3(d) below, no dividends shall be declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment, and no other distribution of cash or other property may be declared and made, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to, any shares of Common Stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking, as to dividends, on parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock (other than a dividend paid in shares of Common Stock or in shares of any other class or series of capital stock ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company) for any period, nor shall any shares of Common Stock or any other shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking, as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, on parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration, nor shall any funds be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of such shares, and no other distribution of cash or other property may be made, directly or indirectly, on or with respect thereto by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for other shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, and except for the acquisition of shares made pursuant to the provisions of Article V of the Charter or Section 9 hereof and the purchase or acquisition of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock), unless full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for all past Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are (i) declared and paid in cash or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment. 
 2 

 (d) When dividends are not paid in full (and a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) on the Series A Preferred Stock and the shares of any other class or series of capital stock ranking, as to dividends, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series A Preferred Stock and each such other class or series of capital stock ranking, as to dividends, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata, so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series A Preferred Stock and such other class or series of capital stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the Series A Preferred Stock and such other class or series of capital stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends on such other class or series of capital stock for prior dividend periods if such other class or series of capital stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series A Preferred Stock which may be in arrears. (e) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash, property or shares of capital stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided herein. Any dividend payment made on the Series A Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividends due with respect to such shares which remain payable. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will accrue as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable. 4. Liquidation Preference . Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of shares of Common Stock or any other class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking, as to rights upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to its stockholders, after payment of or provision for the debts and other liabilities of the Company, a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus an amount per share equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) to, but not including, the date of payment. In the event that, upon such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Company are insufficient to pay the full amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of capital stock of the Company ranking, as to rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and each such other class or series of shares of capital stock ranking, as to rights upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. Written notice of any distribution in connection with such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Company. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company. The consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation, trust or other entity, or the voluntary sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Company s property or business, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company and no such advance notice shall be required. In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation) by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares of capital stock of the Company or otherwise is permitted under the MGCL, no effect shall be given to amounts that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. 5. Optional Redemption by the Company . (a) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable prior to October 19, 2022, except as set forth in Section 6 below or to qualify or to preserve the qualification of the Company as a REIT. 
 3 

 (b) On and after October 19, 2022, the Company, at its option upon not fewer than 30 and not more than 60 days written notice, may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption, without interest, to the extent the Company has funds legally available therefor (the Optional Redemption Right ). If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be redeemed pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares) by lot, or by any other equitable method that the Company determines will not violate the Series A Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9 below). If redemption is to be by lot and, as a result, any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, other than a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that has received an exemption from the Series A Ownership Limit, would have actual ownership, Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership in excess of the Series A Ownership Limit, because such holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock were not redeemed, or were only redeemed in part, then, except as otherwise provided in the Charter, the Company shall redeem the requisite number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock of such holder such that no holder will own Series A Preferred Stock in excess of the Series A Ownership Limit, subsequent to such redemption. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such Series A Preferred Stock at the place, or in accordance with the book-entry procedures, designated in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, payable upon such redemption following such surrender. If (i) notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been given (in the case of a redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock other than to qualify or preserve the qualification of the Company as a REIT), (ii) the funds necessary for such redemption have been set apart by the Company in trust for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption and (iii) irrevocable instructions have been given to pay the redemption price of 25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, then from and after the redemption date, dividends shall cease to accrue on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding, and all rights of the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price of 25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon payable upon such redemption, without interest. So long as full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for all past Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid in cash or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment, nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the Company s right or ability to purchase, from time to time, either at a public or a private sale, all or any part of the Series A Preferred Stock at such price or prices as the Company may determine, subject to the provisions of applicable law, including the repurchase of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in open-market transactions and individual purchases at such prices as the Company negotiates, in each case as duly authorized by the Board. (c) In the event of any redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in order to qualify or preserve the qualification of the Company as a REIT, such redemption shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 5. If the Company calls for redemption any shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 5(c), then the redemption price for such shares will be an amount in cash equal to 25.00 per share together with all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. (d) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series A Preferred Stock for all past Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are (i) authorized, declared and paid in cash or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment, no shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right (as defined in Section 6 below) unless all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Company shall not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or any class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking, as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, on parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of capital stock of the Company ranking, as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock); provided , however , that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase of Series A Preferred Stock, or any other class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking, as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, on parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, by the Company pursuant to the Charter in order to ensure that the Company qualifies or remains qualified as a REIT, or the purchase or acquisition of Series A Preferred Stock or Parity Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 
 4 

 (e) Notice of redemption pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right shall be mailed by the Company, postage prepaid, not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the transfer records maintained by the Company s transfer agent. No failure to give such notice or defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series A Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom such notice was defective or not given; provided that , notice given to the last address of record shall be deemed to be valid notice. In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which the Series A Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iv) the procedures of The Depository Trust Company DTC for book entry transfer of shares of Series A Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date; and (vi) that payment of the redemption price plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon will be made upon book entry transfer of such Series A Preferred Stock in compliance with DTC s procedures. If fewer than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed or the method for determining such number. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required to provide notice to the holder of Series A Preferred Stock in the event such holder s Series A Preferred Stock is redeemed in order for the Company to qualify or to maintain its qualification as a REIT. (f) Any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 may be made conditional on such factors as may be determined by the Board and set forth in the Company s notice of redemption. (g) If a redemption date falls after a Dividend Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, notwithstanding the redemption of such shares on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date, and each holder of Series A Preferred Stock that surrenders its shares on such redemption date shall be entitled to an amount equal to the dividends accruing after the end of the Dividend Period to which such Dividend Payment Date relates, up to, but not including, the redemption date. Except as provided herein, the Company shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series A Preferred Stock for which a notice of redemption pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right has been given. 6. Special Optional Redemption by the Company . (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control/Delisting (as defined below), the Company may, at its option, upon written notice mailed by the Company, postage pre-paid, not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date and addressed to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the stock transfer records of the Company, redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control/Delisting occurred, for cash at a redemption price of 25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the redemption date (the Special Optional Redemption Right ). No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. If, prior to the Change of Control Conversion/Delisting Conversion Date (as defined below), the Company has provided or provides notice of redemption with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (whether pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right), the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described below in Section 7 with respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock subject to such notice. A Change of Control/Delisting is when, after the original issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, any of the following has occurred and is continuing: 
 5 

 (i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of stock of the Company entitling that person to exercise more than 50 of the total voting power of all stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of the Board (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and (ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in (i) above, neither the Company nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities (or American Depositary Receipts representing such securities) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE ), the NYSE American LLC NYSE American ), or the NASDAQ Stock Market NASDAQ ), or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ. (b) In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which the Series A Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, each notice of redemption of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6 shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iv) the procedures of DTC for book entry transfer of shares of Series A Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date; (vi) that payment of the redemption price plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon will be made upon book entry transfer of such Series A Preferred Stock in compliance with DTC s procedures; (vii) that the Series A Preferred Stock is being redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control/Delisting and a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control/Delisting; and (viii) that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to which the notice relates will not be able to tender such Series A Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control/Delisting and each share of Series A Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date. If fewer than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed or the method for determining such number. In this case, the Company shall determine the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed as described in Section 5(b) above. (c) If the Company has given a notice of redemption pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right and has set apart sufficient funds for the redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be treated as no longer being outstanding, no further dividends shall accrue and all other rights of the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall terminate. The holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall retain their right to receive the redemption price per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, without interest. So long as full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for all past Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid in cash or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment, nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the Company s right or ability to purchase, from time to time, either at a public or a private sale, all or any part of the Series A Preferred Stock at such price or prices as the Company may determine, subject to the provisions of applicable law, including the repurchase of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in open-market transactions and individual purchases at such prices as the Company negotiates, in each case as duly authorized by the Board. (d) The holders of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right between such Dividend Record Date and the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or the Company s default in the payment of the dividend due. Except as provided herein, the Company shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series A Preferred Stock for which a notice of redemption pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right has been given. 
 6 

 7. Conversion Right Upon a Change of Control/Delisting . (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control/Delisting, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control/ Delisting Conversion Date, the Company has provided or provides notice of election to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole or in part pursuant to the Optional Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder (the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right ), on a date specified by the Company that can be no earlier than 20 days and no later than 35 days following the date of delivery of the Change of Control/Delisting Company Notice (as defined below) (the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date ), into a number of shares of Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock (the Common Stock Conversion Consideration equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the sum of (x) the liquidation preference amount of 25.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus (y) the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared) to, but not including, the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such accrued but unpaid dividend will be included in this sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined herein), and (B) 2.617801 (the Share Cap ), subject to the following: (i) The Share Cap shall be subject to pro rata adjustments for any stock splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of shares of Common Stock), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a Share Split with respect to the shares of Common Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent to the product of (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. (ii) In the case of a Change of Control/Delisting as a result of which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive consideration other than solely cash, including other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (the Alternative Form Consideration ), a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled thereafter to convert (subject to the Optional Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right) such shares of Series A Preferred Stock not into shares of Common Stock but solely into the kind and amount of Alternative Form Consideration which the holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive upon such Change of Control/Delisting as if such holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then held the Common Stock Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control/Delisting (the Alternative Conversion Consideration and the Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of Control/Delisting, shall be referred to herein as the Conversion Consideration ). (iii) If the holders of shares of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such Change of Control/Delisting, the Conversion Consideration shall be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration actually received by holders of a majority of shares of Common Stock that voted for such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders of a plurality of shares of Common Stock that voted for such an election (if electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be, and shall be subject to any limitations to which all holders of shares of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control/Delisting. 
 7 

 (iv) As used herein, the term Common Stock Price shall mean (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control/Delisting by holders of shares of Common Stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock; or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control/Delisting by holders of the shares of Common Stock is other than solely cash, (x) the average of the closing sale prices per share of Common Stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control/Delisting as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are then traded, or (y) if the shares of Common Stock are not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange, the average of the last quoted bid prices for the shares of Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by OTC Markets Group, Inc. or a similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Change of Control/Delisting. (b) Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control/Delisting, the Company shall provide to holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control/Delisting that describes the resulting Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right (the Change of Control/Delisting Company Notice ). A failure to give such Change of Control/Delisting Company Notice or any defect in the notice or in its mailing shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom the Change of Control/Delisting Company Notice was defective or not given. Each Change of Control/Delisting Company Notice shall state the following: (i) the events constituting the Change of Control/Delisting; (ii) the date of the Change of Control/Delisting; (iii) the last date and time by which the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date, the Company has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 or Section 6 above, holders shall not be able to convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption and such shares shall be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if such shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series A Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent and the conversion agent; and (ix) the procedures that the holders of share of Series A Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right. (c) The Company shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if such organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of such press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), or post a notice on the Company s website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first Business Day following any date on which the Company provides a Change of Control/Delisting Company Notice to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. (d) In order to exercise the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right, a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date, the certificates (if any) or book entries representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer (if certificates are delivered), together with a completed written conversion notice, to the transfer agent. Such conversion notice shall state: (i) the relevant Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right set forth in this Section 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are held in global form, such notice shall comply with applicable procedures of DTC. (e) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Company s transfer agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) if certificated shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series A Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the conversion notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are held in global form, the notice of withdrawal shall comply with applicable procedures of DTC. 
 8 

 (f) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right on the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date, unless prior to the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date, the Company provided or provides notice of its election to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 or 6 above. If the Company elects to redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be so converted and the holders of such shares shall be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. (g) In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right, the Company shall comply with all U.S. federal and state securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert such shares of Series A Preferred Stock for shares of Common Stock to the extent that receipt of such shares of Common Stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to Beneficially Own shares of Common Stock in excess of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit or the Ownership Limit. (h) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Right. In lieu of fractional shares, holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional shares based on the Common Stock Price. (i) The Company shall deliver all shares of Common Stock, cash (including, without limitation, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) and any other property owing upon conversion no later than the third Business Day following the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the persons entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock or other securities delivered upon conversion shall be deemed to have become the holders of record thereof as of the Change of Control/Delisting Conversion Date. 8. Voting Rights . (a) Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as set forth in this Section 8. (b) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive (a Preferred Dividend Default ), the number of directors then constituting the Board shall be increased by two and the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class together with holders of the Parity Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (the Voting Preferred Stock )) shall be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors of the Company (the Preferred Directors ), until all unpaid dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and the Parity Preferred Stock for the past Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been fully declared and paid in cash. (c) The Preferred Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election for a one-year term and each Preferred Director will serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until such Preferred Director s right to hold the office terminates, whichever occurs earlier, subject to such Preferred Director s earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal. The election will take place at (i) either (A) a special meeting called in accordance with Section 8(d) below if the request is received more than 90 days before the date fixed for the Company s next annual or special meeting of stockholders or (B) the next annual or special meeting of stockholders if the request is received within 90 days of the date fixed for the Company s next annual or special meeting of stockholders, and (ii) at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, or special meeting held in place thereof, until all such dividends in arrears on the Series A Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred Stock have been paid in full. A dividend in respect of Series A Preferred Stock shall be considered timely made if made within two Business Days after the applicable Dividend Payment Date if at the time of such late payment date there shall not be any prior Dividend Periods in respect of which full dividends were not timely made at the applicable Dividend Payment Date.
